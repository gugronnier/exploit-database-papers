1. Editor's Report  -  By Aaron Schiff
======================================

This third issue has come out much quicker than I thought it would. This 
is mainly due to a large article by Frenchman Jean-Bernard Condat. Also, 
would readers please read the article 'Changes to CDUGD' and comment on 
whether or not they think the changes are a good idea.

LAW SPECIAL: Issue #1.05 is to be a 'Law Special'. In this issue I wish to 
focus on the New Zealand and Australian laws regarding computer crime (eg 
Hacking, Fraud etc..) For this I need:

* People who have had 'experiences' with the law regarding computer 
  issues.

* People in the Law profession who may be able to shed some 'legal' light 
  on the topic.

* People in the Govt who can provide information.

* People in law enforcement agencies who can help out.

The deadline for submissions to this special issue is March 25th although 
submissions I receive soon after this date will not be rejected.

NORWAY: People in Norway can download CDUGD from Digital Express BBS - the 
phone number is at the top of this issue.

Enjoy the 3rd issue!

--------------------------------------------------------------------------


2. Changes to CDUGD  -  By Aaron Schiff
=======================================

A few changes are to be made to CDUGD. None of them are major, but I hope 
that they will improve the overall success of CDUGD. The changes are:

1) Coverage: CDUGD will still be mostly New Zealand oriented, however, I 
have decided that articles about non - New Zealand computing issues will 
be accepted. I hope that this will broaden the target audience of CDUGD as 
well as raise the number of contributions.

2) Australia: This is not yet a definite change, I am thinking of 
including Australian articles as a normal part of the digest. The decision 
as to whether or not to do this has not yet been made. I would like 
readers to comment (in public or privately) on whether or not this should 
be done. If you are reading this in Australia, please contact me if you 
are able to help out with the Australian side of things in any way (eg 
distribution, writing articles etc...)

3) CDUGD News: This will be a regular column (similar to 'PHRACK World 
News' and is just short descriptions of events happening in the computing 
world. I need someone to write this column on a regular basis. Any 
volunteers?

3. Response to 'Hacking in NZ'  -  By Mark Neely
================================================

** This article is in response to the article 'Hacking in NZ' by The Death 
Pirate and published in CDUGD #1.02 **

>6 Hacking In NZ -  By The Death Pirate
>======================================
>
>Hacking is basically to break or force your way into a system illegally. 
>Basically connecting to another modem without permission. But if this is 
>so, then isn't connecting to a BBS system without permission illegal??

"Hacking" (see arguments re: cracking/hacking...sheesh, everyone bags 
people for confusing the two) essentially means unauthorised access to a 
computer. The more "deviant" the intention behind the intent, then (as a 
general rule - see the decision on appeal in the R T Morris appeal, which 
was as a result of the particular drafting of the legislation) the greater 
the penalty involved.


>This is one point which was heard in the recent trial of a 19 year old 
>hacker in the USA, (refer to your PC World). 

Robert Tappan Morris Jnr. (son of Robert Morris, NSA scientist). He was 
given a suspended sentence, good behaviour bond and a fair amount of 
community services.


>However, really what it should mean is to force, hack into a system 
>without an account or permission.

Not necessarily... the way most legislation is drafted would catch an
authorised user (i.e. with legitimate account + password) trying to 
execute an unauthorised process/command!


>The Author Deliberately left out details which he thought could have 
>enabled any illegal action.

Which "he thought could have enabled any illegal action"...this is hardly
conclusive!


As a side note, as NZ and Australia appear to be strengthening economic 
ties etc, it is likely that we may see the sharing of services (airlines 
today, maybe telecommunications tomorrow!).

Under recent amendments to the Commonwealth Crimes Act (Pt IVA), persons 
who gain unauthorised access to Cth. computers (or computers which the Cth
government have an interest [defined in the legislation]) can be 
prosecuted under the Act.

Of particular note is the section which would appear to provide that 
persons who use a service provided by a Cth authority or body (which one 
would assume would include Telecom??) is also liable for prosecution!!

Thus, practically anyone who uses a modem to "hack" into a computer could 
find themselves liable to prosecution under the Cth Act!

Should there be sufficient interest, I could look into this matter 
further.

Whistleblowers BBS Extremely Successful  -  By Jean-Bernard Condat
==================================================================

  Whistle-blowers may now anonymously report government fraud, waste, and
abuse via computer to the House Government Operations sub-committee on
Government Information, Justice, and Agriculture. The number for the
computer system, which will accept files and messages, is (202) 225-5527.
Aliases are permitted.

  The Truelson' PhD published in 1986, draws upon the theorical framework
of systemic corruption--an organized conspiracy to suppress revelation of
corrupt practices--to propose a retaliation model to account for organiza-
tional retaliation against whistleblowers with legitimate protests. This 
study is one basis of this incredible bulletin board.

  House Government Information Subcommittee's whistleblower computer BBS
has been "tremendously successful" and has generated about "50 substantive
leads" in its two months of operation, Subcommittee Chief Counsel Robert
Gellman said. Board has received 700-800 calls, many from curious browsers
who want to see what's available and others who want to discuss policy 
matters.

  But Gellman said board was designed solely to allow whistle-blowers to
post private notes to alert Subcommittee to instances of waste, fraud and 
abuse, so there isn't much for anyone else to see. There are no files
available to download or bulletin to read, as there are on most bulletin 
boards. Gellman said message senders often don't use their real names,
and Subcommittee staff has used electronic mail feature to send message
back asking for more information.

                THE WHISTLEBLOWER BBS:  OPERATING POLICIES
     
     1. The highest priority on this bulletin board is protecting the
confidentiality of callers.  A caller concerned about confidentiality
should use a pseudonym.

     2. There is no Caller-ID service on the bulletin board's incoming
line.  Incoming calls are not traced.  Each caller must consider the
possibility that a call to this board is being recorded or traced at the
source of the call.

     3. The Whistleblower BBS is operated by an investigative subcommittee
in the United States House of Representatives.  The purpose of the board 
is to assist the Congress in identifying waste, fraud, and abuse in 
federal agencies, programs, contracts, and grants.  No action will be 
taken on any information that does not further this purpose. 

     4. A higher priority will be assigned to matters that involve large
amounts of federal funds or that affect health or safety.  Other matters
may be pursued to the extent permitted by available resources.  

     5. We cannot provide any type of general assistance to callers.  The
board should not be used for any political purpose or to lobby Congress on
legislative or policy matters.  

     6. Messages that relate to the purpose of the board will be
acknowledged.  A caller who provides an investigative lead is encouraged 
to call back in the event more information is required.  Messages that do 
not relate to the purpose of the board may not be acknowledged.  Most 
messages will be erased after they are read.  

     7. General information about investigations that result from
activities on the Whistleblower BBS may be made public, although no
information specifically identifying an individual caller will be 
released. Publicity for the board will help to accomplish its purpose.  
However, a caller will not necessarily be informed about the details of 
any investigation that results from his or her message.

     8. Information obtained on the Whistleblower BBS may be shared with
other congressional investigators, agency Inspectors General, and the
General Accounting Office (the audit arm of Congress).  INFORMATION THAT
SPECIFICALLY IDENTIFIES CALLERS WILL NOT BE SHARED.  Callers should
identify any special confidentiality concerns or expressly state if they
need to place any specific restrictions on the use of the information that
they provide.  Information will not be shared if a caller specifically
requests.

     9. Casual visitors to the board may be deleted from the user base at
any time.  If you call a second time and find that you are not recognized,
just re-register.  It only takes a few seconds.  Users not engaged in
current discussions may also be deleted as a security precaution.

     10. Text files may be uploaded, preferably in ASCII format.  Word
Perfect format is a second choice.  Files may be compressed using standard
compression programs.  Files other than text files will be immediately
deleted.

     11. If you attempt to use a common pseudonym (e.g., John Doe), you 
may find that it is already in use.  When you first enter a name not in 
use, you will receive a message about the board.  If you enter a name that 
is known to the board, you will be asked for a password.  If this happens, 
you must hang up, call again, and use a different name.  Anyone reading 
this has already solved the problem.  This paragraph is included as an
explanation.

                           THE WHISTLEBLOWER BBS

            How to Blow the Whistle on Fraud, Waste, and Abuse

     1. You do NOT have to give your name or identify yourself in any way. 
But you should call again after you have left a message.  Use the same 
name you used the first time and see if there is an answer for you.  Use 
the READ MAIL TO ME command.  This permits continuing communications so 
that we can ask you for more information or clarification.  Allow a few 
days for your message to be read.

     2. Remember that we are more interested in conduct involving
SIGNIFICANT amounts of federal funds or MAJOR instances of wrongdoing.  We
have limited resources, and we are less likely to investigate minor
matters.  When in doubt, we encourage you to report the matter and let us
decide.

     3. Provide enough information so we can find and investigate the
objectionable activity.  Whenever possible, tell us WHO, WHAT, WHERE, 
WHEN, WHY, and HOW.  Be as specific as possible.

     4. WHO:  Identify the agency, office, program, contract, or grant:

          Better:        ABC Department, Z Bureau, Denver Office, Contract
                         Number 123-456 dated 2/1/89
     
     5. WHAT:  Describe the conduct:

          Vague:         Wasted Money

                         end of the fiscal year
          Better:        John Smith authorized the purchase of 200
                         unneeded PCs under contract 123-456 on 9/30/91 to 
                         avoid returning excess funds to the Treasury

     6. WHERE:  State where the activity occurred:  

          Vague:         Unnecessary travel
          Okay:          Trips to Los Angeles
          Good:          Trips from Headquarters to Los Angeles
          Better:        John Smith authorized travel for himself from
                         Chicago to Los Angeles every Friday before the
                         UCLA football team played a game at home so he
                         could watch the game

     7. WHEN:  Provide all relevant dates:

          Vague:         Last year
          Okay:          1990
          Good:          Starting in May 1990
          Better:        Began on May 5, 1990, continued every other week
                         until December 14, 1991

     8. WHY and HOW:  Explain the conduct involved:

          Vague:         Broke the law  
          Okay:          Did not follow procurement rules
          Good:          Failed to obtain sole-source contracting

                         number 123-456, on 5/1/90, under a sole source
                         contract that was not approved by the contracting
                         officer.

5. Large Text File Collection  -  By Aaron Schiff
=================================================

I have gained access to a large collection of 'underground' text files. 
These files are available on request from me. Please send mail to the 
address at the top of this issue stating which file(s) you want and the 
address (e-mail) to which they are to be sent.

Please note that these files are at an overseas site, and therefore cost 
me money to access. For this reason, there is a charge for each of these 
text files. There is a flat rate of 10c per kilobyte (eg a 20k file would 
cost $2). When you request a file I will tell you the address to send the 
money. CDUGD is only making a slight profit on these charges - and any 
money made will go towards covering the costs of publication (eg Usenet e-
mail charges).
