1. Editor's Report   -   By Aaron Schiff
========================================

Welcome to the first 'real' issue of CDUGD. For CDUGD to succeed YOU must 
contribute. Please write articles and help to keep it going!

Previously I have said that CDUGD will be coming out monthly. This is no-
longer true. Following the lead of other publications, CDUGD will come out 
when there are enough articles to support a new issue. This could mean each 
week, fortnight or month, depending on how many articles are sent to me. 
This system will ensure that CDUGD has up to date information and articles 
in each issue.

You may have noticed the address for sending mail to CDUGD has changed. 
This is because the name Digest Daemon was no-longer allowed on FidoNet. 
All mail already sent to the old digest address but not yet received will 
be re-routed to the new address.

FILES ARCHIVE: I need people with collections of useful Text files to 
contact me so that I can build up a large store of them for readers to 
access. I am in the process of obtaining all previous issues of PHRACK and 
CuD and will make them available as soon as possible. All files in the 
CDUGD archive will be available for downloading off the support BBS.

NEW SERVICE: As a service to the community, Sysops may advertise NEW BBS's 
in CDUGD. This is a FREE service but is only for new bbs's and may only be 
used once. Ads must not be longer than 10 lines and should be 75 characters 
wide. Ads in improper format will not be accepted. Please upload your ad to 
the support bbs or mail it to the digest at one of the above addresses.

MAILING LIST: If you are unable to pick up CDUGD from any of the above 
sources you may apply to be put on the CDUGD mailing list. To do so, send 
mail to the digest (and don't forget to include your e-mail address!). Each 
issue of CDUGD will be mailed to you when it comes out.

2. CDUGD NEEDS YOU!   -   By Aaron Schiff
=========================================

Without your support CDUGD cannot succeed. I want people to write articles 
(on a regular basis or otherwise) on any (or any other) of the following 
topics:

Hacking & Phreaking: What you've done; Who's done what & the consequences 
etc...

Viruses: Need I say more?

Profiles of Hackers: Similar to that in PHRACK. I wish to do profiles on 
New Zealand hackers. All it will consist of is a simple phone interview. If 
you don't volunteer, I'll pick you :-)

Telecommunications: Everything to do with modems, Telecom etc...

Concerns of the Computing Community: Anything that concerns you. Please 
speak up. Any articles accepted please. This is YOUR way to contribute.

All Other Topics: ABSOLUTELY ANY SUBJECT will be considered. You write it, 
I'll publish it.

CDUGD is running short of funds. It cannot survive for long without 
financial support. I cannot afford to personally pay for all of the Digests 
expenses (mainly usenet e-mail charges).

If you contribute any money to CDUGD, you can rest assured that it will be 
put to good use and... All donators will get their name at the top of every 
issue of the Digest. Fame at last! 

So please, support the digest, either by donating some money or writing 
articles (or both!).

Available on-line is a message forum for discussing articles in CDUGD and 
making suggestions about improvements etc, but please DO NOT post articles 
to be published to the message area. Instead, upload your article to the 
'CDUGD Uploads' file area. There are 3 file areas available for the 
following purposes:

* CDUGD Uploads: For uploading articles to be published and text files that
                 you would like to see in the archive.

                 from.

I can be contacted on the Misers Vault through Demi-monde. The address is: 
Aaron Schiff 199:350/1. If you have an article or file for the archive I 
would appreciate it if you could upload it to Misers Vault.

Please support this generous donation of services. It is a far better 
support BBS than I personally would be able to set up so USE IT!!

4. CDUGD Virus Column  -  By Scrooge
====================================

[Editors Note: This is going to be a regular column, appearing in most 
issues. Scrooge has kindly volunteered to write this virus report, but 
don't let it put you off writing articles on viruses - any articles on 
viruses will be welcomed with open arms! - Aaron]

In this issue I will look at a virus called 'Stoned' which most of you will 
probably know about already, but is very common on IBM machines. The Stoned 
virus, also called the New Zealand virus, can only infect diskettes, but 
the New Zealand virus variant can also infect hard disks, where it replaces 
the partition boot record, instead of the boot sector.

The virus often activates when booting up or appears when in the middle of 
using a program. When the virus is activated it displays this message :

 Your Computer Is Now Stoned.

This virus seems to have been designed to be harmless, but due to a 
mistake, it did not quite work out that way. On an infected diskette, the 
original boot sector is stored on track 0, head 1, sector 3. This is the 
last sector of the root directory on a 360k diskette, so this will work 
unless the root directory contains more than 96 files. Overwriting this 
sector on a 1.2M diskette is, however, much more likely to cause damage. 
Numerous variants exist of this virus with no significant differences. The 
Stoned virus can be easily detected with SCAN or some similar virus 
detection program.

5. Telepermitted Modems  -  By Ben Kinchant
===========================================

There has been quite a lot of discussion recently about Telepermits and 
modems.  I guess some people are wondering what the all the fuss is about.

This is my attempt at explaining the situation as I see it.

I guess there are only two real factors here, Telecom and their customers. 
First of all, Telecom set down certain standards for devices that are going 
to be connected to their network.

Any device that you have connected to the telephone line should be either 
telepermitted, or if it was made before April 1985, it should be type 
approved by the New Zealand Post Office. Also, any equipment supplied by 
Telecom, or pre 1985 by the New Zealand Post Office is acceptable for 
connection.  A device is ANYTHING connected to your phone line.  This of 
course means jackpoints, wire, phones, modems, faxes, answerphones, in 
short ANYTHING that is connected to the phone line should be telepermitted
or type approved.

Of course these are what Telecom requests you do, and as a rule they don't 
enforce all these rules.  I've never heard of anyone getting into trouble 
for not using telepermitted jackpoints, although IMHO the telepermitted 
ones do look nicer!

So that brings us onto modems.  Yes, modems must be telepermitted if they 
are connected to the telephone network, which in most people's cases I 
guess they are!  So what's the difference between a non telepermitted modem 
and a telepermitted one?  The most obvious one is the sticker one the 
bottom!!  Of course the more important difference is the stuff inside.  
I've owned a telepermitted modem and often used non-telepermitted modems.  
The differences I've noticed are as follows.

*  The telepermitted modems will not let you set the S0 register lower than 
3.  Other modems don't impose this limitation.

*  The non-telepermitted modems usually have poorer isolation  between the 
line and the modem which can cause problems.  

*  The non-telepermitted modems almost never have the New Zealand type 
connectors on them, meaning people may have to make up their own 
connectors, or use adapters.

*  The pulse dialling on non-telepermitted modems is almost always screwed 
up.  New Zealand pulse dialling is back to front compared to most other 
places in the world.  That means to dial 372 7258 on a non-telepermitted 
modem using pulse dialling you would need to enter ATDP 738 3852!

Lets look at some of these in more detail.  Telecom says that any automatic 
answering device connected to their network, must not answer the phone 
until at least 3 half rings have passed.  That's why telepermitted modems 
won't let you set their S0 registers any lower than 3.  (You can set them 
to 0 of course!)  My telepermitted modem would accept ATS0=1 but an ATS0? 
would reveal that the  value of 3 was still being used.  

What's the reason for not being allowed to answer the phone quickly? Well, 
Telecom says that when the ringing tone disappears, that is the indication 
that you are being charged for the call.  If the modem answers very quickly 
then you won't be able to tell when you are being charged for the call.  
This point IMHO is rather pathetic, because as soon as you hear the modem 
you know you have been connected!

Non-telepermitted modems occasionally cause problems on phone lines, but in 
my experience this is fairly rare.  If any problems do occur it will most 
likely be with only the phones on the same line as the modem.

Most of the disadvantages about non-telepermitted modems are  pretty 
trivial, the biggest disadvantage is that Telecom hates them, and the 
biggest advantage is that they are usually a lot cheaper than their 
telepermitted counterparts.  Most of the telepermitted modems are New 
Zealand made, and the costs are much higher because of a smaller market.

So now you may be wonder if there is any reason to get worried. Well, if 
you have a phone line, you agree to abide by the Telecom Standard Terms for 
Residential Telecom Telephone Services.  Here  are some parts of interest 
quoted from that document.  (Without permission!)

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Clause 27:
 PERMITTED EQUIPMENT
 You must not connect any equipment to the Telecom Network, unless
 it has a Telepermit or Telecom or Post Office type approval label.
 You must follow the instructions provided with the equipment when
 connecting it to the Telecom network.

Clause 30:
 INDEMNITY BY YOU
 You will have to pay our charges for repairing damage to the Telecom
 network caused by equipment not having a Telepermit or Telecom or
 Post Office type approval label which has been installed in your
 home or on your property or by sockets or permanent wiring not
 meeting or installed to our specifications.

 You will NOT have to pay any charges for repairing the damage to the
 Telecom network caused by your equipment, sockets, or permanent
 wiring if you use only Telepermit or Type Approved equipment and
 have all your sockets and permanent wiring supplied and installed by
 us, or to our specifications.

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Nasty huh?  :-)...  The contract goes onto say that Telepermits  only mean 
that the device was compatible at the time it was tested and that the 
Telecom Network may not remain compatible with it. It also says that that 
Telecom reserves the right to suspend your Telecom services if you fail to 
meet your responsibilities under the contract.

I guess what I am saying here is that if you do use a non-telepermitted 
modem is that 9 times out of ten it will work fine, and Telecom usually 
wont care, but there is the possibility that you may have to stop using it, 
and also that your telephone services may be suspended if you don't stop.

Its over to you now I guess!

6 Hacking In NZ -  By The Death Pirate
======================================

Hacking is basically to break or force your way into a system illegally. 
Basically connecting to another modem without permission. But if this is 
so, then isn't connecting to a BBS system without permission illegal??

This is one point which was heard in the recent trial of a 19 year old 
hacker in the USA, (refer to your PC World). However, really what it should 
mean is to force,h ack into a system without an account or permission.


New Zealand Hacking..???
++++++++++++++++++++++++


Yes it's true there are a few hundred of businesses which have modem lines, 
fax, etc. But more importantly there are ways of free calling (phreaking) 
out of New Zealand.

Who's to blame..???

Telecom. First off there are many ways in which this can be done; from the 
simple but smart way of ripping phone cables apart to actually using a 
Telecom orientated service right infront of their noses undetected. This 
way only requires a 6 letter name and a 4 digit number. Thus you are in. 
But why haven't our friends at Telescum clicked on?? Well they have, they 
say. An article I have in a text file from some BBS states that Borland 
Pacific have had their phone bills rise from $3,000 a month to something 
like $30,000. Yet still it seems they have done nothing about this.

Why??? 

Perhaps its a nasty trap to catch all who dare to challenge them?

On another matter of free calling, the grey little dome outside your house 
which turns into a convenient seat when its hot and you've locked yourself 
out of your house, that's another way too. Simply lift off the lid and 
change a few wires and hay-presto, your neighbours have landed the bill. I 
don't think Telecom really pay much attention to these subjects, surely.

As we the modem people get more and more bored with BBS'S we will turn to 
some other method of enjoyment. I bet those BBS'S in the US would be fun to 
logon to and have a look around and get the latest stuff.

Latest Stuff, you say.. "hmm where have I heard that before..???"

Perhaps on a BBS add?? Yes, you probably have.

Its true that BBS's in Auckland have actually rang up the states for free 
and simply downloaded the 'latest stuff'. Why not, who's to stop them??

So next time a sysop says 'If you Subscribe you'll receive the latest stuff 
>from the US', just remember what you pay for might not be for the Phone 
Bill.


The Author Deliberately left out details which he thought could have 
enabled any illegal action.

Hereby YOU CANNOT SUE ME!
