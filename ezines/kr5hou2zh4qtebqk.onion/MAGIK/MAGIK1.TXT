     Tired of seeing nothing of any value printed? We are. Our main
purpose in putting this magazine out is to inform people interested
in as many H/P related topics as we can find. We plan on not only
bringing you the latest tips and tricks in the H/P world, but our
own original software.  A zip v1.1 Password Cracker is already in
the works. This is our first issue, which we put out just to get
things going. We have even more stuff which will blow your mind.
Now that Phrack is no longer a regular publication, we intend to
maintain a regular publication schedule, unlike any of the other
rags out there.

                         MAGIK Overview
                       by Electric Vampyre

   (--------------------------------------------------------)
    Welcome to MAGIK Productions first Newsletter. Who is MAGIK?
MAGIK is a conglomeration of PiRaTeS writing to inform the public
of the interesting aspects of computing. MAGIK is an ackronym
standing for [M]asterful [A]narchists [G]iving [I]llicit
[K]nowledge, the writers of MAGIK are practicing PiRaTeS whose
hobbies include programming, P.H, and of course the other ideas of
Cracking, Carding, and Virii.
    We at MAGIK understand that some of our talents may be illegal,
but our purpose is to provide you the information to explore the
various aspects of PiRaTe Computing. We at MAGIK write not for the
elite that knows all this anyway but for the uninformed that wishes
to have more knowledge but cannot find the tools to attain their
goal. Our idea is "inform the public and strengthen all
interested."
    At the point of this publication this phyle can be attained via
internet at the address of MAGIK@pnet01.cts.com (ARCHIE AND FTP
SOON TO COME). For those that do not have an internet account MAGIK
can be reached at the WWiVNeT account of #151 @16964.

                           Arrest Phun
                        by Nombrist Beor

   (--------------------------------------------------------)

                      You've been arrested!

     Life sure sucks now, don't it? Nope. This is where you get to
have more phun while learning a lot about the reason that your
government is NOT your friend.

             "Live in fame or die in flame" -- Mack

     First off, remember: no hero stuff here. They are probably
wearing bullet proof vests, arrive in bunches of 20, and carrying
heavy artillery. Even if it's only one redneck, they all still
suffer from having a severe trigger finger. There is no reason to
get roughed up, bruised, or shot.

                          The Attitude

     You need to have the attitude. Use your head, control your
emotions, and keep your mouth shut at all times. Remember that they
will give rewards to stoolies, so don't even discuss anything
outside of chit-chat like local politics, news, or weather.

     Okay, second. You are not a young punk pain in the ass. You're
not a hero; you're not anything. You are a farm boy from Kentucky
and you're downright DUMB. You're kind and work with everybody as
much as possible, but stubborn. You apologize and call everyone sir
and generally kiss ass whenever possible. Why? Because you look
stupid and easy to take advantage of. Remember keeping your mouth
shut? This is the easiest way to do just that.

     Don't ever ask them for anything. Don't grovel. You are in
control of yourself; they are only in control of the situation.
Your complaints will go on report and give them satisfaction.
Remember "Miranda"? Well, those rights apply at ALL times. There is
no requirement to read them to you in a whole bunch of special
exceptions, so just assume that they've been read to you anyways.
They WILL appear compassionate and sympathetic, but they are really
robotized. They are totally impervious to all reason, logic and
common sense.

     Once you got the basic rules down, the rest of the procedure
is just one big game, except that the stakes are kind of high.
Don't sweat it if you can, but chances are that you're going to be
sweating a lot just because the first time you ever play in a
quarter million dollar poker game, the numbers get to you. Quarter
million? If you're going to be in the dungeon for say 10 years, you
could probably make about $25,000 a year easily. And that's after
the government takes out their share of something close to half. So
you're actually going to be playing for a quarter million dollars
even if it's only five years. Not only that, but once you've been
to jail once, all of your subsequent employers will be harder to
get and possibly pay less. But this is not a game you would
normally show up for. Usually, someone else volunteers you in.
Still not convinced? Well, let's take some numbers (old numbers but
proportions are right). From the official 1977 IRS figures, 8,391
persons qualified for priority treatment (were investigated). 3,408
were recommended for prosecution. Of those lucky winners, only
1,636 were indicted by grand juries. 247 of those were convicted
after trial and less than half ever served time in jail. At that
time, there were also approximately 90 million income tax filers
(out of a total population of 210 million). And we're not talking
about one of the roughest, nastiest teams in the American Legal
League, in most cases.

                      The Rules of the Game

     Okay, the point of the game is to get over the goal line. It's
just like football (and if you try to tempt them, they really will
sack the quarterback just because they are sadistic people). 
Here's what they score points for. Getting you to admit anything.
Getting you to incriminate yourself. Intimidating you. Getting you
to skip procedural details. There's only one problem with these
simple details: they are all professional players and you're just
an amateur team. That's why the game is rigged in your favor
intentionally. But unless you're a professional gambler, you
wouldn't even know it.

     Here's what you score points for. Getting them to admit
anything.
Getting them to perjure themselves. Getting them to foul (not
follow the rules). Giving them as much frustration and anxiety as
possible.  Making them lose in front of their friends (they all
have bad sportsmanship problems). Making them lose in front of the
press.

     I can't possibly go over all the rules. There are entire
libraries full of rules. And you thought pro-football was bad! But,
there are certain basics of the game. If you understand those,
you're way ahead.

                    Getting a Basic Rule Book

     If you want to actually buy a rule book, I know of one good
one that costs about $20. It is mostly for civil (law suits)
procedure, but he covers the differences between civil and criminal
pretty well and how to adapt.

Brown's Lawsuit Cookbook
The Brown Carburetor Co., Inc.
P.O. Box 89
Draper, Utah 84020

     Don't get the "sequel" that he advertises. It's just a book of
forms and not much use except for the two page excerpt at the end
that talks about RICO, if you don't know anything at all about
RICO. Mike Brown's specialty is getting people out of prison, so he
might be useful later on, too. The place he has vast expertise in
is Terre Haute in Indiana, which is not a pretty place to spend an
all expenses paid government vacation at. For one thing, the other
tourists and the tour guides are absolutely lousy.

                         Levels of Play

     There are a bunch of levels of play. You will probably be like
most people and perhaps never even get to the higher levels, like
the appeals process. But unless you do something really stupid and
get shot, you are pretty much guaranteed to make it through the
first few levels. Remember the ways to score points. The more
points you score, the better your chances of winning. There are
some bonus points built in, too, like getting a judge get kicked
off the field for a personal foul (easier than you think, but most
lawyers are scared silly to even try to do anything like that).

1. Arrest.
2. Initial Questioning.
3. Booking.
Bonus Rounds: more questioning and pre-trial services.
4. More Questioning.
5. Arraignment.
Bonus Round: Evidentiary Hearing.
Bonus Round: Administrative Hearing (automatic in a traffic case;
     otherwise rare).
Bonus Round: Grand Jury Indictment.
6. Trial.
7. Sentencing.
8. Appeals (pre-trial services, trials, and sentencing).

     Hopefully, you can make it to at least some bonus rounds.
Getting an evidentiary hearing is relatively easy, for instance.
And at that round, there are some points that you can pick up, but
you can also get some point multipliers that will make scoring in
the actual trial worth more points. There are also no absolutes.
This is just a thumbnail sketch. Some levels can be skipped or
added in. Some levels can be skipped because of mistakes you make.
It is possible, for instance, to petition for a writ of prohibition
(an order from a more powerful judge telling his underling to stop
doing something to you) and go through a pseudo-appeals stage. Some
levels can happen completely by mail instead of in person (this is
very common at the appeals level). But, this basic list of levels
is usually good enough.  As you get better, you should have no
problems finding some of the bonus levels, like the writs (a writ
is an order from a judge which carries a lot of weight) levels.

                           Questioning

Okay, for now, let's go over the basic format to answering
questions.

Officer: Generic Question.
You: "Sir, can you please tell me if my answer to that question is
mandatory or voluntary?"

1. Officer: "Voluntary."
You: "Then I choose not to volunteer."

2. Officer: "Mandatory."
You: "Sir, what will you do to me if I don't answer?"

2a. Officer: "We'll kick the shit out of you."
You: "My answer is XXX under threat of bodily harm, coercion, etc."
or perhaps "I refuse to answer on the grounds that I may
incriminate myself." or perhaps "Show me the law, statute, case, or
whatever it is that makes it mandatory and then I'll answer." This
is a matter of personal taste; if you can take the punishment, go
for it. It depends on the situation.

2b. Officer: "You won't get out of here until you answer."

     They know it. You know it. So what? You'll eventually go to
trial and the judge will either have to force your answers to be a
condition of your release (this is appealable usually) or order you
to do so (which is a violation of the 5th amendment and which gives
you the power to recuse the judge so fast he won't know what
happened since he's now a party to the case by getting evidence on
the record). It really depends on whether or not you want to give
in to them.

     Remember, the whole point here is to attempt to act
cooperative while refusing to say anything if you can help it. This
is true at every stage of the game. There are lots of different
times where they will try to question you. Even other prisoners may
be sent in to try to get you to talk if you're important to them
and you're being a tough nut to crack. So keep acting stupid. Ask
for meaningful assistance of counsel to help you understand the
question. Volunteer for nothing.  After all, don't all the lawyers
tell you that only THEY can understand legal procedure?

     Okay, there is a special case for judges. Remember, judges
have to be impartial. With a judge, when he asks you for
information, such as what your name is, you say:

"Sir, are you attempting to enter evidence on the record because
you are a party to the case?"

This question REALLY pisses them off. If they say no, then don't
volunteer information. If they say yes, then they can't judge the
case anymore. Another appropriate question is, "Your honor, are YOU
the accusing party? Then who is the accusing party? I want to face
my accusers as required by the constitution."

     Here's an example of what happened once: "No, Sir. I just need
to know who you are so I can proceed with this case. And since when
I asked for the accused party, you answered, then if you are not
the accused party then you are interfering with this court and I
will find you in contempt." The right response to this sort of
nastiness is just to say something like, "Sir, It is the job of the
accusing party to identify the accused party; however, if you wish,
you can call me Peter Pan for purposes of identification until the
accusing party clears this matter up." A better way is not to get
into this situation. When you are called, stand and ask if the
accusing party is present. And the judge better not respond!
Otherwise, you just stand there and when the bailiff orders you to
walk forward or whatever, you just say, "I'm sorry if I'm in the
wrong place, Sir.  Your bailiff here ordered me to come forward."
This is part of jurisdiction. Jurisdiction is necessary for a court
to have control over a case. There are lots of ways they can get
it; when you plead guilty or not guilty, or when they get all 7
elements. Number 1 is positive identification of the accused party.
Accused must be properly identified; identified in such a fashion
there is no room for mistaken identity. The individual must be
singled out from all others; otherwise, anyone could be subject to
arrest and trial without benefit of "wrong party" defense. Almost
always the means of identification is a person's proper name, BUT,
any means of identification is equally valid if said means
differentiates the accused without doubt. (There is no
constitutionally valid requirement you must identify yourself) For
stop and identify (4th Amendment) see Brown v. Texas, 443 US 47 and
Kolender v Lawson, 461 US 352.

                             Arrest

     Remember all the things you read about Mirandizing you first?
Forget it. As long as they can get you to admit anything, they can
use it against you, regardless of whether or not you've been
mirandized.

     They will probably put the cuffs on too tight. And they will
handcuff you. Don't complain. Don't ask your kidnappers for
anything. You're the one in control here, not a wimp. Act like it.
Be respectful, though. Don't act better than them or they'll take
it out on you (all cops have deep fears of being inferior to
anybody). Your complaints will go in their report. Don't give them
any satisfaction!

     Do not answer any questions at all. Demand to get meaningful
assistance of counsel and counsel of choice, since it is your right
to have these at EVERY important stage, including the arrest
itself.

     Just try to be as cooperative as possible physically (there is
no reason to get the shit kicked out of you here) because it's not
going to be worth your effort to resist. Besides, that will give
them a reason to kick the shit out of you that they can use in
court.

     As far as the actual mirandizing, when they ask if you
understand, just say the truth. Say "No. I need counsel to help me
understand, Sir."

     You may get lucky. They might give you waist chains or leg
irons. If this happens, wear them with pride! Hardly anybody gets
that kind of treatment anymore and it means you're really special.
Show them off to the other prisoners, to any police you meet, the
public, everybody!

                             Booking

     They will ask for your name? Are you waiving rights if you
answer?  Yep! Aside from that, you could be waiving jurisdiction.
Remember how to answer these questions.."Sir, is the answer to that
question voluntary or mandatory?"

     What about mug shots and fingerprints. They will give those
back if you're not guilty, right? Yes, they'll give you the
originals, but you can be sure they've made copies. In Davis v.
Mississippi, they stated that fingerprints and other personal
identification essentially work like property. They need a search
warrant to get them.

                           Arraignment

     Before you are arraigned, they will probably keep you in a
holding cell until you're talkative. They will send a pre-trial
services
representative to try to get you to tell them your life history.
This is the same routine as booking. Don't answer anything.
At arraignment, the magistrate or judge will read the complaint,
information, or indictment against you and ask if you understand
it.  He is supposed to inform you of your right to assistance of
counsel, that you are not required to make any statements, and that
any statement may be used against you. The whole point of this
procedure is only to tell you what you have been charged with and
to make sure you don't understand it. So answer truthfully and say
"No" if you still don't have counsel. He may also ask you how you
plead. In this case, you may wish to say that "The accused stands
mute." If you make a plea of any sort, you could be giving them
jurisdiction. You could also say that "Since the defendant cannot
understand the charges, the defendant stands mute." The judge will
say "I will enter a not guilty plea for you." Say loud and clear,
"I object! Let the record show that the accused stands mute."

     Then the judge will start asking you personal questions. Shut
up. Keep the voluntary/mandatory routine up.

     Now, the prosecutor or judge or cop is going to absolutely
have a conniption and throw a tantrum because you won't answer
their questions. Let them carry on. In Federal courts, 18 USC 1342
sets release with the least amount of restrictions unless there is
some legitimate reason on which the court can justify the
imposition of restrictions greater than what would reasonably
assure your appearance.  In state courts, the situation is similar.
Okay, now after the government demands something more than your own
recognizance or an unsecured cash bond, then say loud and clear
something like, "Please put on record the fact that the government
has demanded that I be placed under the unreasonable bond
restrictions of XYZ merely because I choose to exercise my right to
remain silent."

     Some of the bond restrictions they may want (which are listed
in 18 USC 1342..find out the equivalent for the state) are distance
of travel, curfew, psychiatric testing, or even weekly reporting.
These are all considered unreasonable except with extra
circumstances (like you jumped bond before).

Object and state "Please put on record that the no reason was given
for the bond restriction of XYZ and the accused objects."

     The judge will most likely make submission of your prints and
pictures a condition of your release. If you don't give in, you'll
sit in jail.  Some of the booking questions will be about your
physical description.  The rest will be personal or about your
family; these are out of line.

     This much should get you at least through the first 3-4 days
of the standard arrest procedure and have heaps of procedural
errors lined up for "arguing technicalities" or appeals.

                         Telephone CCD'ing
                        by Electric Vampyre
   (--------------------------------------------------------)

     With the advent of technology, old forms of getting free calls
have become obsolete.  Almost all forms of boxes can now be
detected and/or curcumvented.  Extenders are monitored and are a
sure way to get caught other then at a pay phone. DEC's are going
cd and nearly hack-proof. PBX's are hard to find and harder to
hack. WHAT'S LEFT?.... CREDIT CARDS, Personal Calling Cards.
     The calling card is a type of credit that recently has become
popular. The idea behind a card is the number plus a four digit
code attached to your subscriber line number (phone number). You
use the number by dialing the card number and then the desired
phone number.

                       Obtaining The Card

     To do this you look through your local phone book for a person
who lives in a lucrative part of town. This is important because
there is less of a chance that the subscriber will notice the
fraudulent charges. To get the card you set up your scanner to dial
the number and then scan for the "pin" number after that. (You will
have to check your phone directory for the dialing specifications
for credit card calling, or the operator but not recommended from
the dialing site) I recommend random dialing over sequential
dialing, this prevents a bored operator noticing an obvious
pattern. You will know when you connect because the phone system
will allow you to call your desired target. An incorrect number
will result in the system asking for you to dial your number again.

                         Using The Card

     Well this is pretty obvious.  They are most effective when
used from pay phones and the occasional long distance call from
your house (which is HIGHLY not reccomended).  A new card every few
weeks (1-2 if used a lot) is recommended.
     This concept works for a few reasons; all the charges on the
card do not appear until the next billing period.  Like all credit
cards, the fraudulent charges must be noticed and reported before
any action can be taken and the charged investigated.  If there
are a few charges (1-2) then the company usually drops the charges
and any ensuing investigations.  If there are enough the suspect
fraud then they will investigate.  If this happens YOURS BUSTED!!
(this is because the phone company records both the destination and
the point of origin of the card). [This is why the cards should be
used SPARINGLY]

                            Paranoia
                        by Electric Vampyre

   (--------------------------------------------------------)

     Once again a good H/P discussion is ruined by an uninformed,
paranoid junior phreak.  The child always yells the same, "the
government is monitoring everyone's line at the switch."  Their
comments always yield nothing in ways of constructive posting and
are a sure way to ruin the conversation.

"You know that the government monitors your line for key words;
then they tap your conversations for a while looking for
something they can bust you on."
                                
              The comments grow as the time passes.
 
     This "GRAND CONSPIRACY" concept would make sense in a
communist state with little phone activity. In a mega-country
like ours this idea is ludicrous no matter how much the
government wants to watch and control our personal lives.
     To understand the absurdities of this statement let's look at
how a phone conversation works (briefly and very roughly). 
Initially, you establish a connection (either an outgoing or
incoming call), then your voice (modem tones, etc.) gets pulse
code modulated. Pulse code modulation (PCM) is a system where
your voice is converted from and analog signal to digital via
sampling, quantizing, and encoding. To obtain this your voice is
sampled at 8000 times per second, converted into an 8 bit "word"
and sent along. For efficiency, the system sends your channel and
23 others on the same line, at the same time, one right after
another. (Rumor has it that the phone co's are going to try and
push 40 lines now? -Talking to a lineman.) 
    At certain lengths along the signals path it is introduced to
a repeater station. Here the code is reconstructed (amplification
would increase unwanted line noise). If any part of the "word" (a
word has the same appearance as a byte. eg - "10110101") is
missing the computer reconstructs the missing part. From
reconstruction the signal is continued on its path.     
    From your house the code is invariably sent along to your
local central office (C.O.) and fed into the electronic switching
system (E.S.S. aka "the switch") [The switch is a VERY large
machine incorporating an entire building as its housing.]
Following directions established in the "word" the switch
redirects the code onward to its destination (a point of
termination [house, etc], another switch, satellite, etc.).
Finally, it is sent through your local tap box (giant green metal
boxes along the streets), remodulated, and echoed through your
phone speaker. 
    For the government to monitor EVERYONE's line they must sort
24 different channels and remodulate 8000 different "words" per
channel every second. Compiling the difficulties, they must also
scan for "key words" after that or listen to each conversation
themselves (i can already see the comments "they use superhuman
listeners..."). Assuming they would do this at a NON-PEAK hour
there are still millions of calls generated and maintained per
second, there would be no way that today's government with its
technology (no matter how advanced it is) could monitor your
line. Why would they care what you are actually saying? Are you
that aloof that you think your mere words are worth the
government's time?
    The only way that telephone monitoring (tapping) is to copy
the signal and send a duplication to another point of
termination. This usually produces easily detected noises, etc
and an alert ear (possibly paranoid) can (hopefully) detect this.

     This is an oversimplified version of the actual processes
involved.  (Ever wonder where line noise came from?)

                         FM Transmitter
                         by The Assassin

   (--------------------------------------------------------)
 
  Ok lets get started...first off you will need the following items
which can be found at your local Radio Shack and any place that
sells HAM radio equipment, ie. a HAM radio swap meet...
 
1) One HAM radio 6-meter band linear amplifier, to boost the FM   
   signal from the tuner for broadcasting. A bandwidth of 6 MHz   
   will work fine.
2) One 6 meter HAM radio antenna
3) One tuner that you will use to send out the signal. The use of 
   a tuner from a stereo is HIGHLY recommended ie. the part of    
  your stereo that you plug all the other components into like a  
  CD player would be plugged in to this and the speakers etc...
4) Two Phono plugs to Tinned Wire (Radio Shack CAT. No. 42-2371)  
   they cost about 2 bucks apiece.
5) 2 long pieces of copper speaker cable
 
 
     Most of this stuff looks a lot like the stuff needed to build
a SnowBox...that is because these two devices both do similar
things...a SnowBox sends VHF signals over the airwaves and either
cancel out weaker stations or distort strong ones and replace them
with whatever the owner of the box wants to show...now since
the xmitter sends out FM waves instead of VHF the result is the
taking over/canceling out of FM stations.
 
Construction of this device is fairly simple the only semihard part
comes when finding the station to broadcast on...
 
First take the two phono plugs and plug them into any audio OUT
jacks on the back of the tuner.
 
Now wrap the 2 Tinned wires from the end of the phono plug around
the input screws on the linear amp.
 
Next wrap each of the speaker wires onto the output screws on the
linear amp.
 
After that take the end of the speaker wire and connect it to the
HAM antenna.
 
 ---------                -------                  ---\ /---
[  Tuner  ] -----------> [  Amp  ] -------------> [ Antenna ]
 ---------                -------                  ---------
 
     Once you finish the actual construction of the xmitter you
have to decide on what station to broadcast on...the station you
choose depends on the length of the HAM antenna. He is the equation
to find length of the antenna to use for a station: Antenna's
length in feet is = 468 divided by the frequency in MHz.
 
Like for 96.3 you divide 468 by 96.3 then that answer is the length
of the antenna:  468/96.3 = 4.86 feet, so cut off 1.14 feet of the
6 footer.
 
     Now play whatever you want through the audio out jack on the
tuner and it will be amplified and sent out to the public!
 
     The uses of this powerful xmitter are obvious...like setting
up a pirate radio show or just plain out fucking over the public
with false information about what they can't see...sounds like a
nice Orson Wells experience to me. Some other things to do aren't
fully known and since I had to rush to get this article in before
the deadline I haven't had time to test them all. Which brings me
to another point about this xmitter...since it uses airwaves it is
not traceable!
 
   Be sure to tell on the air who told you how to make this nifty
device who knows I might be listening - THE ASSASSiN '93
