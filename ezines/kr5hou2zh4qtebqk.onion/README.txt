You just found the best(TM) collection of hacking ezines on all of the intertubes!

A lot of the zines are from the 80s and 90s, but not all of them. Hacker ezines
are not as popular as they used to be, they still exist though.

 This collection contains newsletters, bbs texts, ownages and so much more.
Since everything is ordered by name the zines are completely mixed. So if you do
not like what you read, go to another directory.

 Most of the zines are in nice and easy to read plain text. Not all zines are
released as plain text though, some are released as pdfs and archives. Booo. But
I decided to include them as well if the content is good enough.
 I try to keep the original names of the files and directories. Since I do not
always get the zines from the real source but other collections I can not
guarantee that it is always correct. I also do not modify the zines.

If you want to send me more zines or information use e-mail:
