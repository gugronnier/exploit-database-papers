This articles shows how to take advantage of a "special feature" of
some answering machines to hack their access code in less time.



ANSWERING MACHINES:
-------------------

Most of 'em can be hacked by having ur modem call that machine and try
(at each call) all the possible access codes until u hear the beeeeeep
that tells u it's the right one.

Many answering machines have 3 digits access codes, and give u 7 seconds
at each call to try to find the right access code. So u'll have ur modem
dial as many digits as possible during these 7 seconds... until u hear
the beeeeep.



THE SPECIAL FEATURE:
--------------------

Among those r some machines with the following special feature: when u
dial a list of digits it will search the right 3 digits access code in
*ALL* the list STARTING AT ANY DIGIT. If u dial 123 456 then this special
answering machine will not only see 2 codes "123" & "456": it will see
the following codes: "123", "234", "345", "456".

That's the special feature.



TAKING ADVANTAGE OF IT:
-----------------------

Instead of making ur modem dial 000, 001 ... 999 which would make 3000
digits, u can make it dial a special list of digits: that list is only
about 1000 digits long and has all the 3 digits codes in it.

I wrote a program in C to find that special list. Here is the uuencoded
file:
