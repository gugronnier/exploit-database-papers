ADDENDUM to EFFector Online Volume 09 No. 11

Aug. 2, 1996   editors@eff.org


The Digital Telephony funding provisions have been *REMOVED* from the
modified House anti-terrorism bill.  That bill *has* passed the House, but
from what we know from CDT, HotWired, and others physically on the scene,
the bill contains primarily provisions for beefing up airport security
and other useful things, plus calls for various commissions and studies,
and does not contain any anti-privacy measures. Word has it that primarily
objections from the ACLU led to removal of the DT funding section (that
is, unlike in last night's deliberations, surveillance privacy issues may
have actually be taken seriously this time.)

This removes the immediate danger of Senate passage of, and Presidential
signature on, DT funding as part of a rushed terrorism bill.  However, DT
funding is part of an already passed House appropriations bill as well,
to be reviewed by the Senate before long.  The Senate has adopted no such
provisions as of yet.


* Action to take:

Write or fax *your own* legislators, and urge them to *reject* CALEA
("Digital Telephony") funding in the CJS Approriations Bill emerging from
the House.


* Find Out Who Your Congresspersons Are

Writing letters to, faxing, and phoning your representatives in Congress
is one very important strategy of activism, and an essential way of
making sure YOUR voice is heard on vital issues.

EFF has lists of the Senate and House with contact information, as well
as lists of Congressional committees. These lists are available at:
ftp.eff.org, /pub/Activism/Congress_cmtes/
gopher.eff.org, 1/EFF/Issues/Activism/Congress_cmtes
http://www.eff.org/pub/Activism/Congress_cmtes/

The full Senate and House lists are senate.list and hr.list, respectively.
Those not in the U.S. should seek out similar information about their
own legislative bodies.  EFF will be happy to archive any such
information provided to us, so pass it on!

If you are having difficulty determining who your US legislators are,
try contacting your local League of Women Voters, who maintain a great
deal of legislator information, or consult the free ZIPPER service
that matches Zip Codes to Congressional districts with about 85%
accuracy at:
http://www.stardot.com/~lukeseem/zip.html

Computer Currents Interactive has provided Congress contact info, sorted
by who voted for and against the Communcations Decency Act:

[This addendum has been added to the issue to which is refers, and 
supercedes the action alert in EFFector 09.11.]


Subject: ALERT: Terrorism Bill to Fund Nat'l Wiretap Network Without Action NOW!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


[NOTE: This alert has been superceded by the Addendum, above.]


                             August 2, 1996
                   REPOST THIS ALERT WHERE APPROPRIATE
                DO NOT REDISTRIBUTE AFTER AUGUST 7, 1996

  The Problem
  WHAT YOU CAN DO NOW

____________________________________________________________________________

* News

Though the "antiterrorism" bill did not pass last night, due to polical 
squabbles, the House Rules Committee has stripped the bill of some but 
not all "controversial" provisions, and is pushing the House of 
Represenatives to pass the legislation *TODAY*.

This partially stripped version of the bill, according to ACLU people on 
Capitol Hill, does not have the new wiretapping provisions, unlike the 
version from yesterday, nor does it attempt to restrict or ban encryption.

____________________________________________________________________________

* The Problem

However, this newly amended terror bill  *calls for funding the FBI's 
"Digital Telephony" wiretapping wishlist*, with "extra" intelligence and 
law enforcement funds. 

The FBI until now has been required to follow a public review process 
before proceeding with this wiretap-the-nation proposal.  The plan is so 
big-brotherish and wasteful that it has been stalled repeatedly, despite
waves of terrorism hysteria.  The new House action threatens to override 
the public's right to participate, passing highly controversial wiretap 
funding with no oversight or even meaningful comment from the people.

If the House passes this provision, the Senate is highly likely to do so 
also, before the upcoming recess. The President will certainly sign any 
"antiterrorism" bill that is passed.  

____________________________________________________________________________

* WHAT YOU CAN DO NOW:

Please call and fax these key legislators IMMEDIATELY. 
Contact House members first.

House members:

      D VT Leahy, Patrick J.          1-202-224-4242  1-202-224-3595


Urge them to move Digital Telephony (CALEA) funding out of the 
current proposal, and onto the "controversial" list.

Talking points to get across:

* The FBI wiretapping plan has, to date, met with shuddering, scorn and 
  outrage from the public.  The scheme calls for wiretapping as many as one 
  person in every major city block, simultaneously across the nation.  

* The US has never before been so close to becoming a police state as 
  *right now*.  

* Funding this nightmare, especially in circumvention of the public 
  review process, is anything but "non-controversial".

If you don't have time to come up with a detailed message, here is a 
sample communique:

        Dear _________,

        Please do not rush the passage of counter terrorism legislation;
        I'm concerned that Congress is rushing without carefully
        considering the implications of privacy.  I'm from <city, state>.

	In particular, the funding for CALEA ("Digital Telephony") needs
        to be removed from the bill before any further action. This funding
        is extremely controversial, and has met with almost unanimous
        opposition from not only civil liberties organizations, but the
        informed public as well.

        Thank you,

Upcoming Events
---------------

This schedule lists EFF events, and those we feel might be of interest to
our members.  EFF events (those sponsored by us or featuring an EFF speaker)
are marked with a "*" instead of a "-" after the date.  Simlarly, government
events (such as deadlines for comments on reports or testimony submission,
or conferences at which government representatives are speaking) are marked
with "!" in place of the "-" ("!?" means a govt. speaker may appear, but
we don't know for certain yet.)  And likewise, "+" in place of "-"
indicates a non-USA event.  If it's a foreign EFF event with govt. people,
it'll be "*!+" instead of "-".  You get the idea.

"A peace that comes from fear and not from the heart is the opposite of 
peace."
  - Gersonides

Find yourself wondering if your privacy and freedom of speech are safe 
when bills to censor the Internet are swimming about in a sea of of 
surveillance legislation and anti-terrorism hysteria?  Worried that in 
the rush to make us secure from ourselves that our government 
representatives may deprive us of our essential civil liberties? 
Concerned that legislative efforts nominally to "protect children" will 
actually censor all communications down to only content suitable for 
the playground?  Alarmed by commercial and religious organizations abusing
the judicial and legislative processes to stifle satire, dissent and 
criticism?

Join EFF!   
http://www.eff.org/EFFdocs/join_eff.html (or send any message to info@eff.org).

Even if you don't live in the U.S., the anti-Internet hysteria will soon 
be visiting a legislative body near you.  If it hasn't already.

------------------------------


Subject: What YOU Can Do
------------------------

* Digital Telephony/Comms. Assistance to Law Enforcement Act

The FBI has been seeking both funding for the DT/CALEA wiretapping 
provisions, and preparing to require that staggering numbers of citizens be 
simultaneously wiretappable.  

To oppose the funding, write to your own Senators and Representatives 
urging them to vote against any appropriations for wiretapping. 

In the wake of the Olympics bomb, the US government, both legislative and 
executive branches, are hot to pass new wiretapping laws, and fund the 
DT/CALEA wiretapping provisions.  SPEAK OUT NOW. There is not a moment to 
lose! See lead article in this issue for more information.

See http://www.eff.org/pub/Privacy/Digital_Telephony_FBI/ for more info.


* Anti-Terrorism Bills

Several bills threatening your privacy and free speech have been introduced
recently. Urge your Congresspersons to oppose these unconstitutional and 
Big-Brotherish bills, which threaten freedom of association, free press, 
free speech, and privacy. One such bill passed some time ago, stripped 
of some of the more onerous provisions.  It could have been worse, and 
could yet still be worse: A new anti-terrorism bill posing many threats 
to YOUR privacy is nearing passage. SPEAK OUT NOW. There is not a moment to
lose! See lead article in this issue for more information.

Keep up the pressure. Write to your legislators: No 
secret trials and deportations, no expansion of wiretapping scope or 
authority, no national or "smart-card" ID systems!

For more information on some of this legislation, see 
http://www.eff.org/pub/Privacy/Terrorism_militias/


* The Communications Decency Act & Other Censorship Legislation

The Communications Decency Act and similar legislation pose serious 
threats to freedom of expression online, and to the livelihoods of system 
operators.  The legislation also undermines several crucial privacy 
protections.

Business/industry persons concerned should alert their corporate govt.
affairs office and/or legal counsel.  Everyone should write to their own
Representatives and Senators, letting them know that such abuses of 
public trust will not be tolerated, that legislators who vote against
your free speech rights will be voted against by you in the next elections.

If you do not have full internet access (e.g. WWW), send your request

IMPORTANT! KEEP AN EYE ON YOUR LOCAL LEGISLATURE.  All kinds of wacky
censorious legislation is turning up at the US state and non-US 
national levels.  Don't let it sneak by you - or by the online activism 
community. Without locals on the look out, it's very difficult for the 
Net civil liberties community to keep track of what's happening locally 
as well as globally.


* New Crypto-Privacy Legislation

Urge your Represenatitives to support the Pro-CODE crypto export bill 
(and to fix the few remaining bugs in it).  

For years US export controls on encryption have hampered the development
of secure communications online. This technology is vital for online 
commerce, for national security, and for YOUR electronic privacy.

The new Pro-CODE legislation will go a long way to rectifying the situation.

* The Anti-Electronic Racketeering Act

This bill is unlikely to pass in any form, being very poorly drafted, and 
without much support.  However, the CDA is just as bad and passed with 
flying colors [the jolly roger?] in Congress. It's better to be safe 
than sorry. If you have a few moments to spare, writing to, faxing, or 
calling your Congresspersons to urge opposition to this bill is a good 
idea.


* Medical Privacy Legislation

Several bills relating to medical privacy issues are floating in Congress 
right now. Urge your legislators to support only proposals that *truly* 
enhance the medical privacy of citizens.

More information on this legislation will be available at 
http://www.eff.org/pub/Privacy/Medical/ soon.  Bug mech@eff.org to make 
it appear there faster. :)


* Child Privacy Legislation

A new bill to protect children from unethical marketing practices (e.g. 
tricking kids into revealing personal information by offering prizes or 
games) has been introduced.  EFF and other civil liberties organizations
like, and dislike, various points in this bill.  The legislators 
sponsoring the bill appear interested in resolving the problems in the 
statutory language they have proposed.  More information on this will be 
provided soon.


* Find Out Who Your Congresspersons Are

Writing letters to, faxing, and phoning your representatives in Congress
is one very important strategy of activism, and an essential way of
making sure YOUR voice is heard on vital issues.
