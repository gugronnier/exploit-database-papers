                            NET WORK:
        Three Personal Perspectives on the Uses of the Net

[As the creation of the Net goes forward, and many issues of a
technical, legal or political nature surface, its easy to forget that
the Net is made to be used by people in ways that are neither technical
nor political.  In various groups over the past few weeks, the question
of what the Net is "good for" has arisen in several guises. In this
edition of EFFector Online, we present three "answers".  The first is
from a librarian, the second from a college professor, and the third
from an EFF staff member.  Every so often, it helps to step back from
the wiring, planning, programming, and social engineering and reflect
on the ways in which humanity actually uses the tools it creates.]

         "WHY WOULD ANYONE WANT TO USE A COMPUTER IN A LIBRARY?"
                           by Jean Polly
                          (polly@LPL.ORG)

How does the INTERNET relate to the little guy?

[The previous posters] remarks remind me very much of the response
I got from computer dealers in 1980 when I was seeking advice about
acquiring a computer for public use at my public library.

"Why would ANYONE want to use a computer in a public library-- what on
earth would they use it for???" was the universal attitude, usually
accompanied by a guffaw or two.

Undaunted, I pressed ahead and by October of 1981 we had a 48K Apple II+
out where the Masses could touch it. (Now my kid has 48K on his watch...)

Ten years later, over 1,500 hours per month are reserved on the seven
public computers in our lab. 75% of the use is by adults, although we
have a percentage of families engaged in home-schooling their children
who also use the lab to advantage.

Our clients use the computers and laser printers for everything from
resumes to learning desktop publishing. They create church newsletters,
learn to use databases, practice languages, print mailing labels.

Last year we got an Apple Library of Tomorrow grant, which brought
interactive videodisc technology to our small village library. We have
just become one of 37 libraries nationally to beta-test the Library of
Congress' American Memory Project. This CD-ROM and videodisc archive
contains some 25,000 turn of the Century postcard views of American
landmarks, rare film footage from the 1901 Pan-American Exposition,
audio archives of great American speeches and their text, with photos of
the speakers, plus much more. Subsequent volumes will include Civil War
photos by Matthew Brady, folk songs from the California gold rush days,
oral histories from around the U.S. Everything in the collection is
searchable, much is printable.

And yes, we hope to offer INTERNET connectivity in our lab sometime in
the first half of 1992.

FCC and other government regulations strive to protect public interest
in, and access to, cable TV, radio, amateur radio and other
communications highways; likewise should we advocate public uses of
computer technology, and telecommunications.

Haven't you noticed that your colleagues and friends are quickly being
divided into "who's on email" and "who isn't". Don't you find yourself
talking to "connected" colleagues a lot more frequently than your offline
friends? This is Not a Good Thing. Institutionally. Nationally. Globally.

I have a dream and it's happening right now. Kids talking about their
lives, from Moscow to Mexico City, Cupertino to Halifax. People finding
out about their similarities rather than focusing on what divides them.
All possible on the net.

Gee, you don't need the NREN for just Email, I can hear you say. Right.
Not for text. What about when it includes video, color photos,
multimedia?

Gigabits you say. I don't know how much bandwidth I need to my house. In
1980, 48K did all I wanted, now my desktop takes 8 megs of RAM. I used to
do this at 300 baud, now 9600 seems slow.

You know Warhol's "everyone's famous for 15 minutes?" Once you are into
computers you are only satisfied with what you've got for 15 minutes!
("Faster, higher, stronger", the Olympic motto, could be appropriated by
how many of us, gazing into our CRTs...)

So, to cut to the chase, yes. The little guy not only needs to be
informed about What's Going on Out There, but he needs some way to Be Out
There. I guess you can either be a signpost, or a roadblock, or line
noise.

                      LIBERATION TECHNOLOGY
             Equal Access Via Computer Communication

                        by Norman Coombs
                   (NRCGSH@RITVAX.ISC.RIT.EDU)

I am a blind professor at the Rochester Institute of Technology.As such I
use a computer with a speech synthesizer,and regularly teach a class of
students online with a computer conference. Most of these students have
no physical handicap. Some, however, are hearing impaired, and others
totally deaf. I have team-taught another course at the New School for
Social Research, some 350 miles away, with a teacher who is blind and
confined to a wheelchair. On the computer screen, our handicaps of
blindness and mobility make no difference.

One of the courses I teach online is African American history. In that
class, some students are White, some Black, others Asian, and still
others Native American. Obviously, some of the class members are male and
others female. All of these differences, like those of the handicaps
described above, become unimportant on the computer screen. It isn't that
these characteristics disappear; participants share their identities,
views and feelings freely. However, these differences no longer block
communication and community. In fact, conference members often feel free
to make such differences one of the topics for discussion. A student in
my Black history course said that what he liked about conducting a class
discussion on the computer was that it didn't matter whether a person was
male, female, Black, White, Red, Yellow, blind or deaf. His comments were
accepted for their own worth and not judged by some prior stereotype.

One myth about the computer is that it is cold, depersonalizing and
intimidating. When I began using the computer to communicate with
students, I had no idea of its potential to change my life and my
teaching. First, it liberated me, a blind teacher, from my dependence on
other people. I now have all my assignments submitted through electronic
mail including take-home exams,and have little need for human readers.
Because of this I have become a member of a pilot study using computer
conferencing to replace classroom discussion for students in continuing
education. Students with a personal computer and modem could work from
home or the office. This freed them from the time and bother of commuting
and also let them set their own schedule.The conference facilitates
genuine group discussion without the class having to be in the same place
at the same time. In addition, I find it easy to send frequent personal
notes to individual students, giving me more contact with individual
students than is usual in a traditional classroom.

I find conferencing appeals to three groups. First, the off-campus
continuing education students who no longer have to commute. Second,
those who had been taking television or correspondence courses.  The
online experience gives them a means of exchanging information between
themselves and their teacher. The third group turns out to be regular day
students with scheduling problems. Online is especially valuable for
students whose schedules are filled by laboratory courses.

Although computer conferencing had obvious benefits for me, I had failed
to grasp its significance for disabled students in general. Only when a
deaf student joined the class did I realize its potential. This deaf
woman said that this was the first time in her life that she had
conversed with one of her teachers without using an intermediary. She
also remarked that mine had been her most valuable college course because
she could share in the discussions easily and totally.

Computer conferencing can also benefit people with mobility impairments.
They can go to school while they stay at home. The distance involved
could be anything from a few miles to all the way across the continent or
across an ocean. Students with motor impairments can also use this
system. There are a variety of alternate input devices to let motor
impaired persons use a computer even though they cannot handle a
keyboard.

But conferencing liberates more people than the physically disabled. All
students became less inhibited in the discussions. Once students got over
any initial computer phobia, many found it easier to participate. Where
there is no stage then there is no stage fright.

While some educators prefer to keep the teaching process academic and
objective, others are convinced that students learn more profoundly when
they become emotionally engaged in the process. My class underlined this
aspect of conferencing. In a discussion on welfare, one woman in her
twenties confessed to being on welfare and described her feelings about
it. In a Black history course, students described personal experiences as
victims of racism. White students admitted to having been taught to be
prejudiced and asked for help and understanding. Black students revealed
that they had prejudices about various shades of color within their own
community. As a teacher, I often felt that I was treading on privileged
ground. These were experiences I had never had in the 29 previous years
of my teaching career.

Computer communications is infamous for people making thoughtless and
irresponsible attacks on one another, something known as "flaming". In my
experience, happily, there has been almost none of this. First, the
teacher has the opportunity to set ground rules and establish a
professional atmosphere. Second, a computer conference is different than
electronic mail. Once a mass mailing has been sent, it is irretrievable,
while the contents of a computer conference are posted publicly for all
to see. Most students seemed intuitively aware of the potential for
misunderstanding and, before criticizing someone, they frequently asked
questions to be sure that they understood what had be meant by the
previous author. On very rare occasions I have removed a posting before
it was read by most of the class. Usually, I prefer to leave
controversial material on the conference and utilize it as a group
learning experience.

Computer communication has other important implications for both the
print handicapped and those with motor impairments. Library catalogs can
already be accessed from a personal computer and a modem. Soon, growing
numbers of reference works will be available on-line . While the
copyright problems are complex, it seems inevitable that large amounts of
text material from periodicals and books will also be accessible on a
computer network. I still have vivid memories of the first time I
connected my computer to a library catalog and found my book was really
there. It was only a year ago that I had my first personal, unassisted,
access to an encyclopedia. Not only is this technology liberating to
those of us who have physical impairments, but in turn, it will help to
make us more productive members of society.

Not all handicapped persons rush to join the computer world. Indeed, many
have become dependent on human support systems. Sometimes, independence
is frightening, and handicapped students may need special assistance to
get started. Another problem is cost. While the personal computer has
decentralized power and is seen as a democratizing force in society, it
works mainly for the middle class. Unless there is a deliberate policy to
the contrary, such technology will leave the underclass further behind.

Visually impaired computer users, at present, have one growing worry.
They fear that graphic interfaces and touch screens may take away all
that the computer has promised to them. Recently passed federal
legislation has tried to guarantee that future computer hardware and
software be accessible to all the physically disabled,but there is no
real mechanism to enforce this. Besides, voluntary awareness and
cooperation by computer providers is a far better approach to the
problem. Educom has established EASI to work within the academic
community for software access, and it is having an important impact on
voluntary compliance. Others believe that adaptive software and hardware
can be produced which can adequately interpret graphic interfaces for the
visually impaired.

Physical disabilities serve as an isolating factor in life. They also
create a tremendous sense of powerlessness. Computer communication,
however, serves to bring the world into one's home and puts amazing power
at one's fingertips. Not only can this empowerment liberate the
handicapped to compete in society more equally, but the sense of power
changes how one feels about oneself.

Finally, I am personally excited about the ability of computer networking
to provide more equal access to education and information for many
persons with physical disabilities. In the fall of 1991, The Rochester
Institute of Technology and Gallaudet University in Washington will
conduct an experiment involving two courses: one taught from Rochester
and the other from Washington, DC. Students from both campuses will be
enrolled in both classes. While some use will be made of videos and
movies, class discussions and meetings between a student and a teacher
will all be done with computer telecommunications using Internet as the
connecting link. Some students will be hearing impaired, and one teacher
will be blind.

                    THE NET:WHAT'S IT WORTH?
                         by Mike Godwin
                        (mnemonic@eff.org)

In a recent posting, dhirmes@hamp.hampshire.edu writes:

There are a lot of answers to this question, and I can allude to only a
few of them here.

One answer has to do with the implied premise that there are either moral
or practical reasons to address our most pressing social problems first,
before we deal with public-policy issues that seem less pressing. Is this
premise correct? I don't think so, for a couple of reasons. First of all,
it does not follow that establishing national public networks entails
*not* responding to the nation's economic problems. Surely we can do
both.

Secondly, there is a lot more consensus (even with all the debate one
sees in this and other groups) about how to promote the building of a
network infrastructure in this country than there is about such issues as
poverty, the homeless, and illiteracy. (The disagreements about network
infrastructure tend to be over minor matters, relatively speaking.)

Third, getting people online may actually *help* solve the other
problems, by allowing more public-policy discussion and more
contributions of ideas. It should be noted that networked online
communications are unusual among communications media in that they follow
a "many-to-many" model (everyone on the "Net" can talk to everyone else,
with minimal capital investment), as distinct from the "one-to-many"
model (e.g., newspapers, broadcasting, cable) or the "one-to-one" model
(telephones). What's more, discussions in this medium can be more
discursive and more analytical, since one is not given tight time
constraints to compose or reply to arguments, and since one cannot be
interrupted. One of the reasons the First Amendment exists is to promote
public participation in public-policy issues (such as how to handle
poverty, or the homeless). Thus it makes sense to promote an
infrastructure that allows for the greatest exercise of First Amendment
prerogatives this country has ever seen.

Fourth, if we don't consider the policy issues now, it's not the case
that these issues will wait until we get around to them. They're being
discussed and settled now, and we can't stop the process by not
participating. The question is whether we want all the decisions to be
made with public input or not.

There are other arguments for addressing network policy now, even though
we have other problems facing us, and I'm sure other folks will make
them. But I have not the least moral qualm in giving attention to network
and online-communication policy issues now, since I believe
wholeheartedly that communication is part of the solution to all our
other problems.

                  SUN DEVIL DOCUMENTS RELEASED

The Secret Service's response to CPSR's Freedom of Information Act (FOIA)
request has raised new questions about the scope and conduct of the Sun
Devil investigation. The documents disclosed to CPSR reveal that the
Secret Service monitored communications sent across the Internet. The
materials released through the FOIA include copies of many electronic
newsletters, digests, and Usenet groups including "comp.org.eff.talk,"
"comp.sys.att," "Computer Underground Digest" (alt.cud.cu-digest),
"Effector Online," "Legion of Doom Technical Journals," "Phrack
Newsletter," and "Telecom Digest (comp.dcom.telecom)". Currently, there
is no clear policy for the monitoring of network communications by law
enforcement agents. A 1982 memorandum prepared for the FBI by the
Department of Justice indicated that the FBI would consider monitoring on
a case by case basis. That document was released as a result of a
separate CPSR lawsuit against the FBI.

Additionally, CPSR has found papers that show Bell Labs in New Jersey
passed copies of Telecom Digest to the Secret Service.

The material (approximately 2500 pages) also suggests that the Secret
Service's seizure of computer bulletin boards and other systems during
Operation Sun Devil may have violated the Electronic Communications
Privacy Act of 1986 and the Privacy Protection Act of 1980.

Two sets of logs from a computer bulletin board in Virginia show that the
Secret Service obtained messages in the Spring of 1989 by use of the
system administrator's account. It is unclear how the Secret Service
obtained system administrator access. It is possible that the Secret
Service accessed this system without authorization. The more likely
explanation is that the agency obtained the cooperation of the system
administrator. Another possibility is that this may have been a bulletin
board set up by the Secret Service for a sting operation. Such a bulletin
board was established for an undercover investigation involving
pedophiles.

The documents we received also include references to the video taping of
SummerCon, a computer hackers conference that took place in St. Louis in
1988. The Secret Service employed an informant to attend the conference
and placed hidden cameras to tape the participants. The documents also
show that the Secret Service established a computer database to keep
track of suspected computer hackers. This database contains records of
names, aliases, addresses, phone numbers, known associates, a list of
activities, and various articles associated with each individual.

CPSR is continuing its efforts to obtain government documentation
concerning computer crime investigations conducted by the Secret Service.
These efforts include the litigation of several FOIA lawsuits and
attempts to locate individuals targeted by federal agencies in the course
of such investigations.

             BERMAN TO HEAD NEW EFF WASHINGTON OFFICE

The Electronic Frontier Foundation  today announced the opening of
a permanent office  in Washington D.C. and named Jerry Berman,
former head of the ACLU Information Technology Project, to direct
its operations.

In announcing the move, EFF President Mitchell Kapor said, "The
creation of the Washington office and the appointment of Jerry
Berman demonstrates our commitment to build a national
organization.  It will give the EFF the ability to effectively
advocate policies that will reflect the public's interest in the
creation of new computer and communications technologies."

Jerry Berman, incoming Director of the EFF Washington Office,
stated that, "Our goal is to be the public's voice in Washington
on these issues, and to help create policies that will maximize
both civil liberties and competitiveness in the new social
environments created by digital media."

"The EFF," Berman continued, "is hard at work developing
initiatives that will ensure that all present and future
'electronic highways', from the telephone network to the National
Research and Education Network, enhance First and Fourth Amendment
rights, encourage new entrepreneurial activity, and are open and
accessible to all segments of society."

Jerry Berman was until December 1991 director of the ACLU
Information Technology Project. Previously he was the ACLU's Chief
Legislative Counsel in Washington, D.C. 

During his career, Mr. Berman has played a major role in the
drafting and enactment of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance
Act of 1978 (warrants for national security wiretapping); the
Electronic Communications Privacy Act of 1986 (warrant
requirements for new voice, data, video electronic
communications); and the Video Privacy Protection Act of 1988. 
Over the last two years, he has spearheaded efforts to establish
public access rights to electronic public information.

              UPDATE ON EFF ACTIVITIES

The EFF, through its headquarters in Cambridge and its newly
opened office in Washington, is currently advocating that:
     *Congress establish an "open telecommunications platform"
      featuring "Personal ISDN" ;
     *the open platform be created with legislative safeguards
      that ensure a level playing field for all those competing
      in the information services market;
     *the NREN serve as a "testbed" for new voice, data, and video
      services that will eventually be offered over our National
      Public Network;
     *electronic bulletin boards be afforded the same First
      Amendment protections enjoyed by other media;
     *citizens who use computers for communications purposes be
      afforded the full protection of the Fourth Amendment; 
     *an Electronic Freedom of Information Act be passed that will
      grant citizens access to the electronic version of public
      information consistent with the public's right to know; and
      that
     *technical means be mandated to insure the privacy of
      personal communications carried over cellular and other
      radio-based communications systems.

The Electronic Frontier Foundation is also a co-sponsor (along
with the Consumer Federation of American and the ACLU) and the
principal coordinator of  the Communications Policy Forum, which
is designed to explore the means for achieving the communications
goals of consumer organizations. Over 28 consumer groups, from the
OMB Watch to the NAACP participate in forum activities.  The
Communications Policy Forum is funded by foundations as well as a
diverse group of computer and communications firms.

                WARNING - MICHELANGELO VIRUS (PC)
   Original-Sender: Virus Alert List <VALERT-L@bitnet.LEHIIBM1>
     From: "A. Padgett Peterson" <padgett%dnet.tccslr@com.mmc>


>From all reports this destructive virus is spreading world- wide very
rapidly. Unlike the DataCrime "fizzle" in 1989 which contained similar
destructive capability but never spread, the Michelangelo appears to have
become "common" in just ten months following detection. I have
encountered three cases locally in just the last few weeks.

Three factors make this virus particularly dangerous:

1) The virus uses similar techniques as the "STONED" virus which
while first identifies in early 1988 remains the most common virus
currently reported. Since the virus infects only the Master Boot Record
on hard disks and the boot record of floppy disks, viral detection
techniques that rely on alteration of DOS executable files will not
detect the virus. Similarly, techniques that monitor the status of the
MBR may only provide users with a single warning that, if execution is
permitted to continue, may not be repeated.

2) Michelangelo was first discovered in Europe in mid-1991
consequently many virus scanners in use today will not pick up the virus
unless more recent updates have been obtained.

3) Unlike the Stoned and Jerusalem (the most common viruses in
the past) which are more annoying than dangerous, the Michelangelo virus
will, on its trigger date of March 6th, attempt to overwrite vital areas
of the hard disk rendering it unreadable by DOS. Further, since the FATs
(file allocation tables) may be damaged , unless backups are available
recovery will be very difficult and require someone who is able to
rebuild a corrupt FAT (also a very time-consuming process).

Fortunately, the Michelangelo virus is also very easy to detect: when
resident in a PC, the CHKDSK (included with MS-DOS (Microsoft), PC-DOS
(IBM), and DR-DOS (Digital Research) {all names are registered by their
owners}) program will return a "total bytes memory" value 2048 bytes
lower than normal. This means that a 640k PC which normally returns
655,360 "total bytes memory" will report 653,312. While a low value will
not necessarily mean that Michelangelo or any other virus is present, the
PC should be examined by someone familiar with viral activity to
determine the reason.

If the Michelangelo virus is found, the PC should be turned off until
disinfected properly. All floppy disks and other machines in the area
should then also be examined since the Michelangelo virus is spread in
the boot record (executable area found on all floppy disks including
data-only disks).

and activities into other realms of the electronic frontier, we need the
financial support of individuals and organizations.

If you support our goals and our work, you can show that support by
becoming a member now. Members receive our quarterly newsletter,
EFFECTOR, our bi-weekly electronic newsletter, EFFector Online (if you

Our privacy policy: The Electronic Frontier Foundation will never, under
any circumstances, sell any part of its membership list.  We will, from

work we determine to be in line with our goals.  But with us, member

explicit permission, we assume that you do not wish your membership
disclosed to any group for any reason.
