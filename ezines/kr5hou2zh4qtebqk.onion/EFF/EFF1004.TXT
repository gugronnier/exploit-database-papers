BACKGROUND ON THE CDA AND THE LAW SUIT

The Communications Decency Act was signed into law as part of the
Telecommunications Reform Act on February 8th 1996.  The law makes it a
crime to "display" "indecent" or "patently offensive" material in a public
forum on the Internet.  Opponents argue that the law is overly restrictive
and threatens to severely restrict the free flow of information on the
Internet, and that individual users and parents, not the federal
government, are the best judges of material is appropriate for themselves
and their children.

Two lawsuits were filed to challenge the constitutionality of the CDA in a
Philadelphia federal court in February 1996.

The cases have been brought, respectively, by The Citizens Internet
Empowerment Coalition (CIEC), comprised of the American Library
Association. civil liberties groups, Internet Service Providers, Commercial
Online Service Providers, Newspaper, Magazine and Book Publishers, and over
56,000 individual Internet users. The ACLU, along with a coalition of civil
liberties groups, advocacy groups, online content providers, and others
filed the initial case on the day the CDA was signed into law.

The ACLU and CIEC cases will be argued together before the Supreme Court on
March 19, 1997 by CIEC lead attorney Bruce Ennis.  A decision is expected
in June.

Detailed information on the legal challenges, as well as information about
the CDA, is available at the following web sites:

*  Citizens Internet Empowerment Coalition    -  http://www.ciec.org/
*  The ACLU                                   -  http://www.aclu.org/

The outcome of this legal battle will have far reaching implications.  At
stake is nothing less than the future of the First Amendment in the
information age.

eTRUST INTERNET PRIVACY STUDY

Summary of Market Survey Results

March 12, 1997

prepared for eTRUST by

The Boston Consulting Group
Two Embarcadero Center
San Francisco, California  94111 
tel. 415-732-8000


PROLOGUE

The following pages are a partial summary of the results of a project
conducted by The Boston Consulting Group, Inc. on behalf of eTRUST – 
not-for-profit organization co-founded by CommerceNet and the Electronic
Frontier Foundation 

The focus of the project was to investigate consumer and business attitudes
regarding privacy of personal information online.  A further objective was
to develop a business model for a privacy assurance entity that would create
and enforce guidelines for disclosure of privacy policies and the handling
of personal information online

The BCG project team consisted of:
Michael Kleeman – Vice President
Andy Blackburn – Manager
Theanne Thomson – Consultant


PRIVACY IS A MAJOR CONCERN ON THE INTERNET 
To a Greater Extent Than in the Physical World

PRIVACY IS AN IMPORTANT ELEMENT OF CONSUMER TRUST
Trust Spans Issues of Privacy, Security and Authentication

SCOPE OF eTRUST INTERNET PRIVACY STUDY

SUMMARY OF KEY FINDINGS 

Consumer and Merchant Perspectives on Privacy

Consumers express strong concerns regarding privacy over the Internet;
interested in limiting and controlling spread of their information;
see privacy and security as interrelated and overlapping issues;
generally less willing to disclose more sensitive personal information to
businesses they are not familiar with.

Consumers also recognize that they have only crude control over
dissemination of their personal information primarily through opting-out
or disguising their identity; usually based on a subjective assessment of
trust.

Consumers indicate they would increase the depth and breadth of their
Internet activity in response to a privacy disclosure and assurance program.
Assurance of non-dissemination of personal information would have a
significant impact, increasing consumer willingness to participate in
e-commerce by a factor of 2 to 3.

Disclosure of privacy practices alone would have a more limited impact,
increasing consumer willingness to participate by approximately 50%
The combined positive impact on e-commerce could reach $6B by 2000.

Merchants also express interest in a privacy assurance program, however,
they are less certain about specific benefits to their businesses.
Smaller companies seeking trusted brand recognition see highest value.
Larger companies want a proven, credible program before signing on.


CONSUMERS PRIVACY CONCERNS ARE LIMITING INTERNET ACTIVITY AND THE GROWTH OF
E-COMMERCE

PRIVACY IS A CONSISTENT, SIGNIFICANT CONCERN FOR INTERNET
CONSUMERS 

PRIVACY IS AN ISSUE ACROSS ALL AGES AND INCOMES

A LARGE PROPORTION OF CONSUMERS SEE SECURITY AND PRIVACY AS OVERLAPPING ISSUES 

CONSUMERS INDICATE PRIVACY ASSURANCE HAS GREATER VALUE THAN DISCLOSURE ALONE 

Consumers were asked under what conditions they would be willing to
disclose various types of information over the Internet:

 * would give today;

 * would give if privacy policies disclosed — e.g., including if
   information is shared with third party;

 * would give if privacy policies disclosed and privacy was assured —
   e.g., no information given to third party.

With no privacy disclosure, consumers are less likely to disclose key
financial information (credit card number, Social Security number, bank and
stock information) than basic demographic or registration information over
the Internet.


CONSUMERS INDICATE PRIVACY ASSURANCE HAS GREATER VALUE THAN DISCLOSURE ALONE

Privacy disclosure increases consumer willingness to give information.
If a site discloses its privacy practices, up to 18% of respondents would
give information that they otherwise wouldn'’t discloes.

Assurance of non-dissemination of personal information has a much more
significant impact if a site assures non-dissemination of personal
information; up to 45% of respondents would give more sensitive
information they otherwise wouldn'’ tdisclose.

Reflects strong consumer desire to control the spread of their
information.

CONSUMER WILLINGNESS TO DISCLOSE VARIES WITH TYPE OF INFORMATION AND KIND
OF BUSINESS

CONSUMERS ARE LESS WILLING TO DISCLOSE PERSONAL INFORMATION TO UNFAMILIAR
COMPANIES

MOST WEB SITES TODAY REPRESENT SMALLER, LESS WELL KNOWN COMPANIES

DISCLOSURE OF PRIVACY PRACTICES INCREASES CONSUMER COMFORT IN GIVING
INFORMATION 

Levels the playing field for companies with low brand recognition.

PRIVACY ASSURANCE IS LIKELY TO BOLSTER E-COMMERCE 

Consumers want to know that their information will be treated responsibly.

PRIVACY ASSURANCE COULD HAVE UP TO A $6 BILLION IMPACT ON E-COMMERCE BY 2000

If privacy programs are adopted by commerce sites

MERCHANTS SURVEYED EXPRESS INTEREST IN AN INTERNET PRIVACY ASSURANCE PROGRAM

But level of interest varies with size of firm.

Most merchants interviewed express interest in a privacy assurance program
Small businesses seeking stronger brand recognition and credibility
expressed higher interest (62%) than larger businesses with strong existing
brands outside the Internet (47%).

Majority of merchants perceive the primary benefit of privacy assurance to
be promoting electronic commerce in general

A subset believe privacy will have a direct economic impact on their
businesses.

Smaller businesses project higher impact than larger businesses (30%
increase in customers versus 15% increase).

Large businesses want proven credibility before signing on worry about
diluting their brand.

SMALL AND MEDIUM-SIZED COMPANIES HAVE THE GREATEST INTEREST IN PRIVACY
ASSURANCE

PRIVACY ASSURANCE PERCEIVED PRIMARILY AS OFFERING BROAD SOCIAL BENEFITS

Businesses also foresee some direct economic benefits.


SUMMARY 

Consumers are concerned about controlling the privacy of their personal
 information on the Internet.

Privacy concerns generate multiple negative effects on e-commerce:
 * low rates of consumer participation;
 * falsification of personal information given online;
 * potential for government intervention.

Consumers would welcome Internet privacy assurance,
 indicating that they would modify their behavior accordingly.

Online businesses would also support a privacy assurance entity  with
 varying levels of enthusiasm:

 * Promote the good of e-commerce;
 * Potential benefit to their business.

An independent privacy assurance entity could generate significant benefits
for e-commerce as well as for consumers and online businesses:

 * Increased consumer trust and confidence in online businesses;
 * Higher accuracy of consumer information provided online;
 * Increased consumer online activity, valued at up to $6 billion by 2000.

* Internet Taxation Issue Heats Up: "No New Taxes"!

In the wake of White House Sr. Policy Advisor Ira Magaziner's global
e-commerce report, positioning in the US Administration against the
creation of new Internet taxes, 3 bills have been introduced to make such
a policy the law of the land. The new action also comes on the heel of
widespread opposition to imposition of special "access fee" tariffs on
Internet service providers (to be paid to local phone companies).

Of the new bills, first out of the gate on March 6 was the Tax-Free
Internet Act (TFIA) of Rep. Dave Weldon (R-FL). Weldon's legislation
specifically exempts Internet and other online services from federal 
taxes, and even forbids the use of federal funds to develop Internet
taxation proposals. The bill number is HR995.

More recently, a bicameral bill, the Internet Tax Freedom Act of 1997
(ITFA) has been introduced in the House by Rep. Chris Cox (R-CA) and Rep.
Rick White (R-WA), and in the Senate by Sen. Ron Wyden (D-OR).  Though
there is a Republic majority involved (not surprisings, given that this is
a taxation issue), the effort is bi-partisan, and all three sponsors are
members of Congressional Internet Caucus.  ITFA, the bill number and full
text of which is not available at e-press time, places a moratorium on
state and local taxes on the Internet or interactive services (sales and
user taxes still apply) establishes a task force made up of local, state
and federal representatives that will issue a finding within 18 months
after enactment of the legislation, directing the federal government on
how to deal with the taxation issue; and prohibits the Federal
Communication Commission (FCC) from setting rates for Internet services,
according to a Press release from White's office. The summary is
consistent with an short analysis of the legislation issued by Rep.
Wyden's office. The bill also calls for the White House to seek agreements
with other countries to keep the Net free from taxes and tariffs.

All of these efforts are in marked contrast the majority of US state and
local action regarding taxation and the Internet, which has to date
been almost invariably aimed at imposing some kind of taxation.

EFF has to agree with the sponsors of ITFA, noting that the existence of
over 30,000 taxation jurisdictions within the US alone makes for an
intractable problem if any and all such jurisdictions can impose taxes
upon online transactions.

* Web Link Lawsuits Raise Serious Questions

              Comments of the Electronic Frontier Foundation 
                     on Web Content Linkage Lawsuits

 Mar. 17, 1996.

In an action similar to a (settled) legal threat over "inlining" of
copyrighted comic strip graphics in a third party web page, a host of
publishing companies have filed suit in New York City federal district
court against a company called TotalNews.  TotalNews uses the experimental
"frames" extension to Web code to point their site's visitors to various
news sources around the Web.  CNN, Washington Post, Dow Jones, Times
Mirror and Reuters, who have filed the suit, allege that TotalNews'
practice of displaying the content of the various companies' news sites
within a "frame" with TotalNew's banner ads, is a violation of the
companies' rights. 

It is not at all clear that such a practice is infringing in any way,
under copyright law.  The intermediary site, TotalNews, does not actually
make any copy of content from CNN, et al, but rather simply instructs the
user's Web browser to obtain the content direct from CNN, et al., and to
display that content within an ad-bearing from provided by TotalNews.

There is essentially a conflict between two theoretical approaches to
copyright: one that says claims of infringement should be interpreted
based on what *functionally* is occurring (that is, on whether
it *functions* just like a traditional infringment) and another that says
the issue of infringement turns on what is technically true about the
facts -- e.g., whether an actual, unlicensed copy was made by the
defendant. Each alternative is "reasonable" (in that they are both
consistent with most prior cases), and yet "unreasonable" in that either
may result in rulings that have negative consequence for Internet users.
As with many other areas of the law, now probably is just not the time to
settle these issues governmentally, as the technology is moving too
rapidly for any branch of government to keep up.

Because the law of course does not recognize any distinction between HTML
code making use of Netscape & Microsoft proprietary "frames"
capabilities, and that which does not, it will be very difficult for a
judge to issue a ruling in favor of the plaintiffs that will not seriously
harm the public interest by restricting much or all Web linkage.

The plaintiffs allege more than simply copyright infringment in the
TotalNews case, also claiming the practice infringes trademarks,
constitutes misappropriation, and trademark dilution. Some of these claims
may have merits, depending upon the facts discovered in this case. EFF
does not address most of these claims.  But, the underlying premise that
because TotalNews is not providing its own content and is simply pointing
to others' content, is untenable. Under such logic, any directory of
pointers to other sources of information could be criminalized.

There is of course no guarantee that the court will carry this case very
far, much less fail to fully understand what is at stake and
therefore issue harmful but precedent-setting rulings. The danger is there
however, and is a grave one due to the very complicated nature of Web
protocols, and due to how poorly these facts map onto aging copyright law.

EFF calls on the participants in this dispute to please keep the interests
of the public in mind.  In particular, it is the position of EFF that:

1) There are technical and industry-standards methods, as well as
legalistic means, of dealing with the problem of linkage of material in
such a way as to obscure the original source.
 
2) Sites using such links in a deliberately misleading manner should be
critized and exposed as plagiarists (and possibly trademark infringers
in some cases). Whether there is any copyright issue here that can be
defended without serious harm to the public interest is highly
questionable.

3) Technical solutions can solve this problem in a far less dangerous
manner than lawsuits, e.g. by working with the issuers of draft standards
to ensure that they work better and hamper others' rights as little as
possible if at all, and/or by protecting one's own content from random
outside linkage by usage of visitor registrations or subscriptions using
login IDs and passwords.

4) When dealing with new and rapidly-changing technology, disputes of this
nature are best settled by carefully considered arbitration or bilateral
compromise, in private, rather than in the judicial system, where
decisions can have long-lasting precedence and disastrous fallout.

5) If any such case should proceed in the courts, all parties to the suit
should go to great lengths to educate the court about the Internet and the
Web, and how they operate, in sufficient technical detail that judge and
jury understand the mechanism by which content is referenced and copied,
from whom, to whom.  

EFF recognizes that intentionally plagiaristic abuse of inlining and
frames within web pages is a valid issue of concern. However, this would
not appear to be the modus operandi of TotalNews, which serves as an
index of and jumping-off point to online news sources, much the way Yahoo
or HotBot provide links to other sites. The only difference (barring
actual trademark infringement of which we are unaware) would appear to be
presentation.  The presentation issues are principally an artifact of the
technology, and it may be incumbent upon the WWW standards community to
seek solutions to what must be viewed by intellectual property holders as
a form of security hole, even if others find it to be a useful feature.

EFF does not presume to offer a magic bullet solution to the problems.
Perhaps frames are simply too troublesome and should be abandoned. Maybe
content providers must yield and acknowledge others' right to build
directories that frame the target content.  The real answer probably lies
in the middle, perhaps in the creation of a framing/inlining permissions
protocol, or in the adoption of password protections by content providers.

Incidentally, EFF would like to observe that this kind of dispute, which
grows beyond its bounds and poses risks to the health of the Net and to
the rights of all users, is a powerful argument against willy-nilly,
widespread, public alpha-testing of experimental extensions to accepted
standards.  It may be that such extensions, like unstable software, should
be tested and reviewed in more private, controlled circumstances.
It may be a good idea to include in this process review by attorneys
and policy analysts with an eye to ferreting out and fixing legal
difficulties that may arise, before public release and implementation
cause crises of this sort.

It is incumbent upon the participants in this medium to create industry
practices and new forms of netiquette that allow one to make full
responsible use of new technologies while still repsecting copyright and
tradmark holders.  Courts cannot do this for us.

Subject: Upcoming Events
------------------------

This schedule lists EFF events, and those we feel might be of interest to
our members.  EFF events (those sponsored by us or featuring an EFF speaker)
are marked with a "*" instead of a "-" after the date.  Simlarly, government
events (such as deadlines for comments on reports or testimony submission,
or conferences at which government representatives are speaking) are marked
with "!" in place of the "-" ("!?" means a govt. speaker may appear, but
we don't know for certain yet.)  And likewise, "+" in place of "-"
indicates a non-USA event.  If it's a foreign EFF event with govt. people,
it'll be "*!+" instead of "-".  You get the idea. To let us know about an
event, please send details to Dennis Derryberry, dennis@eff.org, with a
subject line containing "CALENDAR:" followed by the name of the event.

Subject: Quote of the Day
-------------------------

"All bad precedents begin with justifiable measures."
  - Julius Caesar

Find yourself wondering if your privacy and freedom of speech are safe 
when bills to censor the Internet are swimming about in a sea of of 
surveillance legislation and anti-terrorism hysteria?  Worried that in 
the rush to make us secure from ourselves that our government 
representatives may deprive us of our essential civil liberties? 
Concerned that legislative efforts nominally to "protect children" will 
actually censor all communications down to only content suitable for 
the playground?  Alarmed by commercial and religious organizations abusing
the judicial and legislative processes to stifle satire, dissent and 
criticism?

Join EFF!   
http://www.eff.org/join (or send any message to info@eff.org).

Even if you don't live in the U.S., the anti-Internet hysteria will soon 
be visiting a legislative body near you.  If it hasn't already.

------------------------------


Subject: What YOU Can Do
------------------------

* Keep an eye on your local legislature/parliament!
All kinds of wacky censorious legislation is turning up at the US state 
and non-US national levels.  Don't let it sneak by you - or by the 
online activism community. Without locals on the look out, it's very 
difficult for the Net civil liberties community to keep track of what's 
happening locally as well as globally.


* Inform your corporate government affairs person or staff counsel
if you have one. Keep them up to speed on developments you learn of,
and let your company's management know if you spot an issue that warrants
your company's involvement.


* Find out who your congresspersons are

Writing letters to, faxing, and phoning your representatives in Congress
is one very important strategy of activism, and an essential way of
making sure YOUR voice is heard on vital issues.

If you are having difficulty determining who your US legislators are,
try contacting your local League of Women Voters, who maintain a great 
deal of legislator information, or consult the free ZIPPER service
that matches Zip Codes to Congressional districts with about 85%
accuracy at:
http://www.stardot.com/~lukeseem/zip.html

Computer Currents Interactive has provided Congress contact info, sorted 
by who voted for and against the Communications Decency Act:
http://www.currents.net/congress.html (NB: Some of these folks have, 
fortunately, been voted out of office.)

We are not presently aware of servers that provide contact info for non-US
legislators.


* Join EFF!

You *know* privacy, freedom of speech and ability to make your voice heard
in government are important. You have probably participated in our online
campaigns and forums.  Have you become a member of EFF yet?  The best way to
protect your online rights is to be fully informed and to make your
opinions heard.  EFF members are informed and are making a difference.  Join
EFF today!
