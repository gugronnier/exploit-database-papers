Amendment 1

Congress shall encourage the practice of Judeo-Christian religion by 
its own public exercise thereof and shall make no laws abridging the

which is copyrighted, sexually arousing, or deeply offensive to 
non-Europeans, non-males, differently-abled or alternatively 
preferenced persons; or the right of the people peaceably to

A front-page story (headlined "High tech, high crimes") in today's
Santa Cruz Sentinel features a fascinating quote from the Chief of
Police of Scotts Valley:

   "It's all new", says Scotts Valley Police Chief Steve Walpole.
   "Twenty years ago, who would have thought you could arrest 
    someone for what's in his head?"

MIT Discovers Athena Security Breech

Recently, the MIT Information Systems staff discovered that one of 
the Institute's Athena dialup servers had been compromised through an
unauthorized modification of the machine's system software.

If you have used the Athena dialup service during the last
two months to telnet to other machines, read on. Your
accounts on other machines may have been compromised.

Specifically, each time the telnet command was executed on this 
Athena dialup machine the userid, password, and name of the system to 
which the Athena user was connecting were evidently captured by an 
unauthorized user.  This individual is now in a position to use the 
captured information to gain access to other systems.   Our official 
system logs indicate that during the time the modified version of the 
telnet program was in place, over 4000 individuals used this particular
dialup server.   Those individuals who executed the telnet command from 
this machine within the past two months may have had their accounts on 
other machines compromised. 

Check your username

To determine whether you are among the 4000 individuals most at 
risk, you can use a command called checkmyid located in the Athena info
locker. From your Athena account, at the athena% prompt, type:

attach info
/mit/info/checkmyid

Change your password

We recommend that all Athena users change their passwords frequently -
once a semester is recommended.  If checkmyid verifies that you are 
one of the 4000 people who used this specific dialup server during the 
last two months, we STRONGLY recommend that you change your 
passwords immediately on  ALL systems, including Athena, to which you may 
have telneted. You must assume that all accounts you may have reached 
using telnet are compromised.

Your new Athena password should be at least 6 characters long, and can
contain any combination of UPPER- and lower-case letters, numbers, 
or other symbols that appear on the computer keyboard. For further
information on choosing a secure password, see Athena's On-Line 
Help Service.

Alert others

In addition please inform the system manager of any machines -
including Athena workstations in faculty offices - to which you may 
have connected, since it is possible that the intruder may have used your
account to compromise those machines as well.

The individual who compromised our system used a pattern of attack
identical to one used by an individual operating from outside the 
MIT community to attack a number of systems across the country during 
the past year.  In all likelihood, if you are among those whose accounts
were compromised, you will probably not find any damage to your 
files.

This individual's mode of operation is believed to be limited to
breaking into accounts for the sole purpose of discovering any 
userids and passwords stored there to enable him to break into additional
systems.

We sincerely apologize for the inconvenience this causes our user
community. We have taken immediate steps to eliminate this 
particular security threat and we are reviewing and modifying our operational
procedures to limit our vulnerability to this and other types of 
attacks in the future.

If you have any questions or comments, please send electronic mail 
to <netsecurity@mit.edu> or contact your Athena cluster manager.

                       BBS Legislative Watch
             Legislation from Last Congress that May Affect
                   Your Online Communications
                 by Shari Steele (EFF attorney)


For those of us communicating electronically, it is often hard to see
how involvement in the bureaucracy of Washington, D.C., could have 
any positive impact on our lives online.  But laws that can have great
effect on our online rights are constantly introduced and modified in
the United States Congress and local legislatures, and last year was 
no exception.  While the 102nd Congress is now history, here is a sample 
of the legislation introduced over the past year that will likely affect
those of us building communities on the electronic frontier.

Threats to Privacy

FBI's Wiretapping Proposal Thwarted

In a move that worried privacy experts, software manufacturers and
telephone companies, the FBI proposed legislation to amend the
Communications Act of 1934 to make it easier for the Bureau to 
perform electronic wiretapping.  The proposed legislation, entitled "Digital
Telephony," would have required communications service providers 
and hardware manufacturers to make their systems "tappable" by 
providing "back doors" through which law enforcement officers could intercept
communications.  Furthermore, this capability would have to be 
provided undetectably, while the communication was in progress, exclusive of 
any communications between other parties, regardless of the mobility of 
the target of the FBI's investigation, and without degradation of service.

The security risks are obvious; if law enforcement officers can "tap"
into a conversation, so can others with harmful intent.  The privacy
implications are also frightening.  Today, all sorts of information
about who we are and what we do, such as medical records, credit reports
and employment data, are held on electronic databases.  If these
databases have government-mandated "tappability," this private
information could potentially be accessed by anyone tapping in.  To add
insult to injury, the FBI proposal suggests that the cost of providing
this wiretapping "service" to the Bureau would have to be bourne by 
the service provider itself, which ultimately means you and I will be 
paying higher user fees.

The Electronic Frontier Foundation organized a broad coalition of 
public interest and industry groups, from Computer Professionals for Social
Responsibility (CPSR) and the ACLU to AT&T and Sun MicroSystems, 
to oppose the legislation.  A white paper produced by EFF and ratified 
by the coalition, entitled, "An Analysis of the FBI Digital Telephony
Proposal," was widely distributed throughout the Congress.  Senator
Patrick Leahy (D-Vermont) and Representative Don Edwards (D-
California), chairs of two key committees, referred to the EFF paper as they 
delayed introduction of the FBI's proposal.  As Leahy stated before the 
Senate, "Our goal is to assist law enforcement," but "without jeopardizing
privacy rights or frustrating the development of new communications
technologies."  The Justice Department lobbied hard in the final days 
to get Congress to take up the bill before Congress adjourned, but the 
bill never even found a Congressional sponsor (and was therefore never
officially introduced).  The FBI will almost certainly reintroduce
"Digital Telephony" when the 103rd Congress convenes in January.

Cellular Scanners Prohibited

The wrong solution won out as Congress attempted to protect the 
privacy of users of cellular telephones.  Congress chose to ban scanners as it
amended the Communications Act of 1934 with the FCC Authorization Act of
1991.  The Authorization Act, among other things, prohibits the U.S.
manufacture and importation of scanning receivers capable of:  
receiving cellular transmissions, being easily altered to receive cellular
transmissions, or being equipped with decoders to convert digital
cellular transmissions to analog voice audio.  While privacy 
protection is always important, EFF opposed the bill, arguing that technical
solutions, such as encryption, are the only way to protect private
communications carried over the airwaves.

Unable to stop the scanner ban, EFF worked with Representative 
Edward Markey (D-Massachusetts) and Senator Ernest Hollings (D-South 
Carolina) to add an amendment to the legislation requiring the FCC to study 
the impact of this law on privacy.  Sometime in 1993, the FCC must also
conduct a public inquiry and issue a report on alternative means for
protecting cellular telephone conversations with a focus on 
encryption.


Threats to Free Speech

Federal Agency to Study Hate Crimes on BBSs

Recognizing that electronic media have been used more and more 
often to spread messages of hate and bigotry, Congress mandated the 
National Telecommunications and Information Adminstration (NTIA) to 
conduct a study on "the role of telecommunications in crimes of hate and 
violent acts against ethnic, religious, and racial minorities."  Computer
bulletin boards are specifically mentioned as one of the targeted 
media to be studied under the Telecommunications Authorization Act of 
1992. Representative Markey, while supporting the Act in the House, 
cautioned NTIA to be sensitive to privacy concerns while conducting the study. 
A report on the results of the study will be presented to the Senate
before the end of June, 1993.

Congress Regulates Video Transmissions

Much has been written about the passage of the Cable Television 
Consumer Protection and Competition Act of 1992, more commonly known as 
the "Cable Act."  While specifically designed to regulate rates, establish
customer service requirements and prevent unfair competition for 
cable television providers, the Cable Act may have broader implications for
those of us communicating online.  The communications networks of 
the future will include video and data transmission, as well as the voice
transmission we are now used to using over the telephone lines.  The
Cable Act is Congress's first attempt to regulate the wire/cable
transmissions that will make up our networks of the future.  EFF is
currently studying the implications of this legislation, specifically as
it applies to free speech over the network.


Threats to the Public's Right to Government Information

Fees Charged for Use of Government BBS

In a poorly thought-out move designed to raise federal revenues,
Congress passed a law permitting the Federal Maritime Commission 
to charge user fees on its Automated Tariff Filing and Information 
System (AFTI).  The law requires shippers, freight forwarders, ocean carriers
and third-party information vendors to pay 46 cents for every 
minute they are connected to the government-sponsored electronic database.

EFF joined with many other groups, including library groups, the
Information Industry Association and The Journal of Commerce, in
opposing this legislation.  EFF and the others fear that this precedent
of allowing the government to charge citizens more than the 
government's cost for information could be applied to many other federal 
databases and impinge on the public's access to government data in electronic
formats.

Federal Employees Denied Copyrights for Government Software

EFF joined with several other organizations to successfully stop the
Technology Transfer Improvements Act in a Senate committee after 
it had passed in the House of Representatives.  This Act would have allowed 
the federal government to claim copyright in certain computer software
created by federal employees working with non-federal parties.  
Because so much government information is stored only in computerized 
formats, EFF and the others, including the Software Publishers Association,
American Library Association, and Information Industry Association, 
were concerned that this legislation would impinge on a citizen's right to
obtain and use government information that he or she has the right 
to obtain and use.

Reproducing Copyrighted Software Now a Felony

Under the strong lobby of the Software Publishers Association, Congress
decided to stiffen penalties for individuals making illegal
reproductions of copyrighted software.  The amended law makes
reproducing copyrighted software a felony if certain conditions are 
met. According to the statute, any person who makes 1) at least ten copies 
2) of one or more copyrighted works 3) that have a retail value of more
than $2500, can be imprisoned for up to five years and/or fined
$250,000.  In order for the infringement to be a criminal violation,
however, the copies must be made "willfully and for purposes of
commerical advantage or private financial gain."  While the term
"willfully" is not defined in the statute, previous criminal court cases
on copyright law have held that the person making the copies must 
have known that his or her behavior was illegal.  Software backups are not
illegal (in fact, they are usually encouraged by software providers),
and therefore do not fall under the scope of this statute.

Like most of us, EFF is concerned about the ramifications of this
legislation.  While the statute itself provides safeguards that seem to
place heavy restrictions on how the law is applied, we are wary that
improper application of the law could result in extreme penalties for
software users.  We will be monitoring cases brought under this 
statute and intervening if we see civil liberties violations taking place.

Network Access for All

Commercial Users Given Internet Access

Congress gave the National Science Foundation (NSF), the agency
overseeing the Internet, the authority to relax some of its access rules
governing certain types of information travelling over the network,
including commercial information.  The Internet has been an educational
and research-oriented network since the 1980s.  Over the past few 
years, however, the Internet has become increasingly open to non-
educational and commercial uses.  The National Science Foundation Act was 
amended to encourage an increase in network uses that will ultimately support
research and education activities.

While the amendment was still being considered by the House Science
Subcommittee, chaired by Representative Richard Boucher (D- Virginia),
EFF's President, Mitch Kapor, argued for more flexible rules to spur
diversity and innovation on the Internet.  Relying in part on Kapor's
contentions, Representative Boucher sponsored the amendment as it 
passed in the full House of Representatives; Senator Albert Gore (D-
Tennessee) championed it in the Senate.  EFF lobbied to convince potential
congressional and industry opponents that the legislation would
facilitate, not impede, wider access to the Internet.


EFF's Open Platform Proposal Introduced

This past Fall, Mitch Kapor testified before the House Subcommittee 
on Telecommunications and Finance about the perceived dangers of 
regional Bell telephone company entry into the information services market.  
To combat the fear that the Bells would engage in anticompetitive 
behavior, EFF proposed an information network for the near future that would 
be affordable, equitable, and easily-accessible (EFF's Open Platform
Proposal).  Kapor suggested that ISDN could make such a network 
possible sooner rather than later and at little expense.

Legislation was circulated near the end of Congress which included 
the Open Platform Proposal.  The proposed legislation, entitled the
"Telecommunications Competition and Services Act of 1992," was 
sponsored by House Telecommunications and Finance Subcommitee Chair 
Markey and would give government support to anyone moving forward to 
provide digital telecommunications now over existing copper wires.  This, 
in turn, would pave the way for a broadband network requiring
telecommunications infrastructure modernization in the future.  This
piece of legislation laid the groundwork for a major debate in the 
next Congress, especially since President-elect Clinton and Vice-President-
elect Gore have committed themselves to an infrastructure of 
information highways.

As you can see, Congress has been very busy creating legislation that
may affect your lives online.  Next month, we will make some 
predictions of areas where the 103rd Congress is likely to concentrate 
its efforts.
