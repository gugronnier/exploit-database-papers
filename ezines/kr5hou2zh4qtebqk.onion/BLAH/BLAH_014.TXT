        You know, just because he's in charge of the day-to-day task of
running the nation doesn't mean that the president doesn't want to hear
what YOU, the little guy on the street, think of his performance.  Really!
The president may not read every letter that comes across his desk, but
if something important is coming his way, he'll hear about it.
        That's why you should pick up pen and paper and jot off a little
note to our favourite archconservative nazi and let him know how you feel.
But wait!  Maybe, if the letter is a little rude, it wouldn't be such a
good idea to put YOUR name on it.  How about someone ELSE's name and
address?  Say...  An enemy of yours?
        Let's say there's this guy, Chuck Schmuck, who's been giving you
a bit of trouble.  Not being the political type, Chuck would never tell
the president what you KNOW he is thinking, so why not be a nice guy and
do it for him?  Just whip out your trusty word processor and type up 
something like this:

                                                Chuck Schmuck
                                                111 Jock St.
                                                Littledick, NJ.
Dear Mr. Bush,
        I think you suck.  Not only I think you suck, but God does too.
In fact, God told me to kill you with my sniper rifle.  I think I will.
Don't get too close to your windows, because I'm going to wait till you
least expect it, then blow your head off.  So there.
                                        Yours Truly,
                                                Chuck Schmuck

        If you have a talent for forgery, you can even sign and envelope
this letter so your "friend" doesn't even have to see it!  Aren't you 
a nice person for being so considerate?  In a few days, Mr. Schmuck will
most likely be thoroughly investigated, tapped, and permanantly marked
by our beloved secret service.  He might even recieve a visit from the
Guys in Dark Glasses!  Can you say "jail term for threatening a President's
life", boys and ghouls?
        Isn't America wonderful?
