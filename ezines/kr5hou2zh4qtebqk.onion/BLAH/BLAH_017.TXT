        Anyone who's ever been on a chat line knows that you get all kinds
of twits, modem word for losers, on them.  You've got your basic 
schitzophrenic, mass murderer (or someone aspiring to be one), 31 year olds 
who have no life but to hangout with 13 year old girls and beg for play, 
and, my favorite, the horny adolescent.  Well, anyway, I'm on this super
lame chat line, where your not allowed to express anything and almost 
everybody has Zer0 <hint> personality, and I figure why not log on as a girl, 
say Jill, and see if I can get some loser to hit on me.  
I got more than that...

Chessman to Mike: Rub it between your hands, and  <--- Woooo... Where'd that

P#2(T1:Mike) I am rubbing my hard
 cock slowly

P#2(T1:Mike) it is large and hard,
 about 8"

Chessman to Mike:  Are you sure?  Measure it.

P#2(T1:Mike) Ok.  Maybe 6 inches.             <-- If that pal...

P#2(T1:Mike) my hard cock moves
 slowly up and down your hot slit

Chessman to Mike: Rub fast and think of me in a sPa. Imagine you're 
                  stabbing me like a murderer.


P#1(T1:Mike) it is long and thick,     <--- He's talking about his asshole
 about 2-2 1/2" thick                       of course.  He spent a short time
                                            in prison with a sweet man named 
                                            Bubba...

P#1(T1:Mike) big long and hairy

#5(T1:Chessman) yes.. that's it.
  Mike is now the twit of the month
 for BLaH... he's the 1st monthly
 recipient but there WILL be more..

#5(T1:Chessman) hitting on women
 over the modem is definitely an
 immediate brandishing! hahaha

#5(T1:Chessman) masturbating over
 the modem is worse!

#5(T1:Chessman) WaCKy!  BLaH! 


        And so ends the saga of the LameR...  or does it.  Ever since I
learned to capture things, I've had some wonderfully bizarre and insane
conversations.  We'll see.

{---Uh Huh!--------------------------------------------------------------}

        One day two women were walking through the wilderness, and they
happened to stumble upon a set of tracks.  One said, "Hey those look an awful
lot like raccoon tracks."  The other insisted, "Those are chicken tracks."
They were still arguing when the train hit them...
