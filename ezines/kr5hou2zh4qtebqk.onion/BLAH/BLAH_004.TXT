Wacky Fun For the Whole Family!

	Well, this is my first BLaH file and I figured what better way to 
start than give out a little of my own information.  I'm not a hacker, 
phreaker, carder, or anarchist (in the real sense of the word).  I don't 
know Pascal and Assembler, I have limited knowledge of virii, and I can't 
tell you the first thing about cracking.  Now, I know you're thinking 
what a lamer... let's delete this file, and go get some 2 hour WaReZ so 
everyone will think we're so k-rad and give us lots and lots of file 
points so we can download some more k-rad WaReZ every 15 minutes.  Or 
maybe you're thinking well, if he isn't a ZanY anarchist, and 
unfortunately almost everyone reading this is not, what does he bring to 
the modemming world?  Well, as far as I know, I bring the most complete 
knowledge of mass murder that I've seen and a plain WaCkY sense of humor...  
Yes, that's right kiddies you don't have to be a groovy anarchist or 
k-rad cracker to write something.  All you need to do is know something 
and know it well.  Shocking, isn't it?

Let the fun begin:

	What is attractive about murder?  Well, what isn't?  You've got the 
beauty of the twisted mind coupled with sheer terror and the erotic beauty 
of blood and violence.  At this point you haven't even taken into account 
the fiendish motive of the killer or the question of, "who done it."  For 
example take the fantastic case of William Herbert Wallace...  To sum up:

                           "Willie had a mistress
			      Willie had a wife
			He only wanted one of them so,
			     Willie took a life."
		      -"Murder Can Be Fun" Issue 12

Willie's wife ended up dead, her head beaten in with a poker from the 
fireplace, but Willie had a decently established, but poorly executed alibi.  
The real beauty is that all the evidence the prosecution used against him, 
the defense used.  There was no way around it...  everything that could 
possibly be held against him, could also be used to set him free.  What 
isn't great about that?  The deed is done and there is no way to bring 
Willie's deserving of pain wife back so why not relish in the splendor of the 
crime itself?  Imagine finding the wife of a mild-mannered, chess playing 
insurance agent naked in her living room with her head beaten in and her 
husband's burned mackintosh stuffed under her body...  Imagine the devilish 
rumors that must have travelled through the town.  After all, what brings 
people together better than a good murder?  Was Willie innocent or guilty?  
I leave it up to those that truly seek that knowledge.

	So that is what I bring to BLaH...  A fresh new face in a world of 
lamers and dreamers.  Hopefully I be able to release a little fiction 
occasionally, so I'll start with a little taste of my world of violence:

The Butcher celebrated within the saturnalia of blood.  He danced upon the 
brains of the long dead children, and wrigled in the insides of the older 
ones who had not been so lucky.  They hung upside down, completely gutted, 
hanging onto their last breath, and weeping at the sight of the dead.  He 
had no remorse though.  Long ago that had been erased from his mind by the 
evil women in his life.  How glad he was that he had killed his grandmother 
and slaughtered sisters.  They only held him back from his true goal of 
ultimate destruction and utter chaos in a world that he would reign over...

	Don't get the wrong impression, I have no desire to kill anyone.  I 
write as a release and am working towards my goal of mastery of the criminal 
mind.  Sometimes, the pressure gets to me and I feel the animal inside me 
clawing its way out, but I fight it, and I believe I'm able to control 
it (for now).  But when that animal has to shit, imagine what it's like 
cleaning it up.  I also get a little nervous when it gets gas...
