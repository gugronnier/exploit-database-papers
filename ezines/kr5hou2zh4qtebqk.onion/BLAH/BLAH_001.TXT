INTRO:
Welcome to my world. The world that is BLaH. I'd put the ! at the end of the
group name, the way Pepsi Man wanted it, like BLaH!, or even nifty little
brackets like [BLaH]. But in the first case, it's a pain to make an ANSI
exclamation point; in the second, it'll look too much like [NuKE] <you'll
never EVER catch Nowhere Man typing it without the brackets... he's got a
macro for it even> or the name of a virus. Sure, I've had the macro "BLaH"
before this group ever started, about a week ago or so. I also did that nifty
little ANSI title on the top in PURE ascii, in DOS Edit, using alt-221, etc.
Well, enough of my blathering on like a lunatic. Ebert doesn't like that at
all <in reference to Scrooged with Bill Murray>. On with the introduction to
the group!
I LIED, THIS IS THE INTRO:
Ok, here are some tidbits on BLaH. BLaH is composed of, so far, Chessman and
myself. You'll hear about Chessman later, a modemer with a newfound fetish
for murder. BLaH is an acronym for Big Long and Hairy. It originated last
year, about June of 1991, when there used to be this really fun board, called
The Baron's Bistro. The SysOp, The Baron, was a great guy, had a talent for
making a board thrive in posts, etc. The board had maybe 30 megs of space
total, and only a few REALLY good pirate games in the file bases < ie
Lemmings, etc>. It was 2400, and a VERY message oriented board. We're talking 
like 200 posts a day or so, and really fun conversations too. Very fast-paced.
There was no discussion of hack/phreak/virus/anarchy/carding. The message
base "The Elite Conference Table" was mostly ideals and philosophy. Kinda.
Out of this abundance of thought exchange, BLaH was born. The Baron said it
a lot, and no one knew what it meant. Neither did he. He just said it as a
void. Like a "whatever", "nevermind", "ok, great...". Just an end to a letter,
or a substitute for something to say. It was also a partition of ideas. For
example "I killed someone today .. .blah..what brand of pickles does your
mother like the best?". The Baron looked at it, and noticed that it was an
acronym for Big Long and Hairy. Hence, the term is born.
ZA/\/:
Also born of these same message bases was a group called ZA/\/. The Zhit Axis
/\/ations. I was a member/minister of ZA/\/, and many works were released.
There was poetry, religion-bashing, ORIGINAL anarchy texts that WORKED. The
Baron has tried and tested more anarchy texts than anyone I have ever known.
This was all great and dandy, and there was a main ZA/\/ board called United 
States Conect/Ying Yang. It was one of those board-in-a-board dealies. In 
about August, ZA/\/ died mostly because of personal reasons between the sysop
of the ZA/\/ main board and another modemer. Yay. That's another story that
I probably won't ever get into. Then, the posts started going down on the
Bistro to a surprising 30 a day. This was unheard of. Plus, the posting was
lame. They were one line responses to huge 5 page quoted messages. A user
came about named Chuck that contributed to the insanity, and formed his own
anti-ZA/\/ish <meaning exact opposite of ZA/\/> group called MaDCaP. Then,
The Baron got pissed, and the holocaust came about. out of the 178 users,
about 120 of them were deleted. The board became completely private <the new
user password was THEBIGZONK, an indication that there was still some hope
left for the wackiness>, and I gave the baron all of my viruses, and we <I
was a sysop, remote though> started up a hack/phreak board. I used to do that
stuff a LOT, and The Baron was an eager learner, so we posted invitations on
some of the better hack/phreak boards, and people called. There were no ratios
at all, and everything was peachy. The Bistro went down in February of 1992, 
because The Baron was bored. Well, for a year, there was one hell of a board. 
The Baron's Bistro. Rest In Peace.
ANYWAYYY:
There's the little historical epilogue to the story of BLaH. Essentially, 
that epilogue is what this group is about. Storytelling. Writing text files
for the sheer joy of spreading the information. Speaking your mind and crushing
other opinions that can't be supported. Isn't it great? Well, hey, if it's not
then stop reading, delete this file, and spread the damn zipfile around to
other boards so you can get file points and good ratios to download the latest
k-rad-1-k00l 0-2 hour s00per ELITE ware, and then upload that everywhere for
more credit. Jumpin Jesus on a Pogostick. Everyone knows thats the way it's
done, why do you think they call you a warez geek? Because you don't PLAY the
damn games. Well, that's what BLaH is out to do. To play the game. What is
the game? Falling Down Stairs.
