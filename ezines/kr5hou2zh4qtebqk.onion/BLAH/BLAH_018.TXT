        Greetings to all those who read BLaH. In the tradition of Chessman,
because this is my first official BLaH I'll give y'all a little background.
I supose I am what most would call an anarchist, but my intrests in anarchy
are for the short term only. I do belive in a violent overthrow of our 
goverrnment, as that is the only forseeable escape from its self serving
manipulation, endless bureacracy, and lethargic complacency.  If this
revolution could be achieved I would condone a form of government. (One that
exists to serve the people and is controlled by the people. Unlike ours
today which controls the people to serve it.) This makes me a non-anarchist.
Well 'nuff said 'bout dat shit. lets git it on with SATAN hehehe.....
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        Satan. Ahh yes, Satan. What is the purpose of Satan worship you may
ask.  Well, let me explain.  Most Satan worshiping, or psuedo-satan
worshiping Joe Average will see is executed by social outcasts who really
don't take themselves or Satan very seriously.  The social outcast, a person
labled as a freak for one reason or another, may turn to Satan to boost thier
self-esteem; to feel in some way associated with a part of humanity (one that
they think cannot turn them away).
        Well I say PHOOEY on that.  There IS a place for Satan in mainstream
culture.  To worship Satan (whether you really belive what you're saying and
doing or not) is to shit on everything you have been brought up to believe. In
my oh-so respected opinion I think the protestant church could stand to have a
massive piece of shit (the kind that festers in your body for days while you 
are constipated) dropped all over thier load-o-bull bible and crock of
steaming frothing shit beliefs.  The worship of satan also denotes a passionate
yet healthy hate for the human race.  And why not hate humans, they are 
responsible for the rape and plunder of the worlds resorces. And if we were to
kill all of the humans there would be.. umm.. HEY WAIT !!!! If we killed all
the humans there would be no one left to have circle jerks with !!
        Ok screw Satan. Worship Me. Just think of Me as the new Satan. I
condone shitting on the moral fabric of the world, but hey, there is an added
bonus.  Think of me as Satan with the biscut game... Yea thats right ...
I could just be called "Phritz the Jerk-Off God of the Abyss"

Yea and while in the topic of shit. Couldn't you go for a warm mug of diahrea

the Quail Hunter, whatever you wanna call him. Included with his satan text is
the poem on which basis we admitted him to BLaH. The members are : Guido
Sanchez, Chessman, Constantine, and now Phritz. If you'd like to join BLaH,
you probably already know how.. so BLaH.
