        Well, it's almost election time again-- what are YOU gonna do
about it?  You could vote for Bush/Quayle, but then you'd have to live
with putting a diehard conservative and his moronically incompetent
stooge back in office.  You could vote for Clinton/Gore, but then you'd
have to live with TIPPER GORE CONSTANTLY ON TELEVISION AGAIN!  It seems
like a tough choice either way, right?  Wrong!  The Dream Candidate is
HERE, friends...
        Why vote for the LESSER of all evils?  Go for CTHULHU IN '92!
        That's right, the demon-lord of R'leyh has thrown his (10 mile
diameter) hat into the ring!  Voted "Most Likely to Eat the Universe"
by Playbeing Magazine, he's a one-man presidential machine!  Of course, 
when you've got a candidate this big (and we mean BIG), only one vice-
president will do-- Nyarlathotep, the Crawling Chaos!  It's the Ticket
from Hell, and this is their platform:

1:  As promises to slash spending have failed in the past, Cthulhu will
  slash the SPENDERS.  Congress will be summarily devoured, and the Senate
  reserved for diabolical sacrifices.

2:  No new taxes!  Every family will, however, be requrired to offer their
  firstborn child.

3:  More riots.  Lots more.

4:  Arms spending and nuclear proliferation will end, because Cthulhu's
  first act as President will be to eat all other nations.

5:  Changes in our stuffy old traditions-- national bird will be the
  Byhakee, national flag will bear the Yellow Sign, and the national
  song will be changed to that grand old classic, "Ia!  Ia!  Cthulhu
  Ftaghuan!".

6:  No matter who you vote for, the world is going to end.  With Cthulhu,
  you at least get nifty pyrotechnics.

7:  The Necronomicon will be required reading in public schools, and
  school prayer will be reinstated in a BIG way.

8:  No more PTL.

9:  If elected, Nyarlathotep will eat Dan Quayle alive on national
  television.  New episodes of "Murphy Brown" will air immediately
  afterward.

        There it is-- the simple 9-point plan to bring this nation back
on its feet.  So go out and register to vote today!  And if you're still
not convinced, just remember one thing-- when the Deep Ones march from
house to house asking who voted and who didn't, do YOU want to tell
them that you went Republican?  Didn't think so.
