This is a list of things, 101 to be exact, that a person can excrete. This
is NOT a unisex list, sorry you people with the Men's [Bowel] Movement and
Women's Lib[rary for Dirty Jokes], but today, I'm just not my politically
correct self. This includes liquids, solids, gasses, and plasmas. Virtually
ANYTHING that can come out of your body. Enjoy! Alphabetized for your ultra-
convenience. Ok, so I'm a bit redundant. But it's educational! I never knew
there were so many ways to say "shit".

Well, off to have my milk and cookies!

I ALMOST stopped at 69, because I couldn't think of any more off hand. Thank
whoever for biology textbooks from 1964, eh? So there ARE 101, count em yer-
self. I already alphabetized and described them, and am not about to fucking 
number them too.

Have we missed any?? If so, please contact me on Nun-Beaters Anonymous. Talk
about a gimmick for a board.. "Call Today and Mention a Bodily Excretion for
50 File Points!"
