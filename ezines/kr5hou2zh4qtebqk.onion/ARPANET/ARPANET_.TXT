      Hacking ARPANET -- Part III

                  by

              The Source


***************************************

     ARPANET can't be faulted for the
amount of information it is willing to
disclose to anyone who knows the number
of a dial-up and knows enough to type in
"N" and then follow directions.  But
the EXEC is, after all, limited to
managing inter-computer phone calls.
Even more interesting material is
available once you get onto what is
known as one of the network's "server"
computers.

OPENING THE DOOR
----------------

     Once you have reached the Exec on a
TIP, getting the door to a server
machine to open to you is no problem.
At the "" prompt type "O" for open
followed by a space and then by two
numbers separated by a comma.  The
numbers represent the address of a
computer system.  The first number may
be from 0 to 3, and the second number
may range from 0 to 15:

     O 0,11
     <the Exec responds:>
     TCP Trying...SU-AI WAITS 9.17/H
Assembled 06/17/84
     .Open

The ".Open" shows that you're in.  There
is a great deal you can do at this
level, and you don't even have a
password yet -- as far as the system
knows, you're still "anonymous guest"!
Most server systems operate under the
UNIX operating system, so any good
manual on UNIX should tell you more than
you need to know.  But now that we've
reached Stanford University's Artificial
Intelligence Lab (having been switched
there by SRI, formerly Stanford Research
Institute), let's take a look at what's
available.  First, list the HELP files:

MORE HELP
---------

     If you'd like, try "HELP HELPER"
for yourself.  Meanwhile more detailed
listings of some help files follow.
 .....
 .HELP GUEST
There is no general guest account on
this system.  There are some commands
that can be given without an account, as
listed below.  If you need to know more
about any of these, type "HELP
<topic><carriage return>".  For
information on special control
characters and commands, type "HELP
TTY".
 WHO, FINGER, WHERE, WHEN provide
information about people and jobs
currently running.
 MAIL, SEND, GRIPE permit you to send
messages and converse with people on the
system.  (You can use SEND to ask
someone who is logged in to form a
two-way link with you.)
 DIR lists the files in specified
directories.
 TYPE lets you type out the contents of
text files.
 FIND searches text files and prints
those paragraphs that contain specified
keywords.
If you need to do more than the above
programs permit, say "HELP LOGIN".

 .HELP NETDOC

(Much network information is available
from the Network Information Center at
SRI-NIC.  Please consult the network
liaison, Martin Frost (ME), for more
information about the network or the
resources available to you at the NIC.)
A large library of source and
documentation files about the network,
NOT including the host table, live on
the [S,NET] directory.  Even more
hardcopy documentation is available in
the bookshelf in ME's office for the
general SAIL community (please ask ME
before borrowing anything).  The host
table files can be found on [HST,NET].
The NETWRK library of network
subroutines can be found in
NETWRK.FAI[S,NET] and NETWRK.MID[S,NET].
     Some interesting files are:
HOSTS.TXT[HST,NET]      The source of
the host table
SUAI.TXT[S,NET]         Our write-up in
the Arpanet Resource Handbook.
     Most of the network user-level
documentation is contained in the
Monitor Command Manual, which can be
found online by giving the monitor
command READ MONCOM<cr>.  Large online
directories of network documetation
exist at SRI-NIC as <NETINFO> and MIT-DMS
as NETDOC;.
     Type HELP NETWRK for information on
programming for the network.

 ...HELP HOST
Job 5    SU-AI WAITS 9.17/H  Assembled
06/17/84
The HOST command is used to look up
information in the host table about a
particular host name or host number.
This information includes the official
name of the host if the name is a
nickname, all host numbers known for
that host, whether the host is a user or
a server, the host machine and the host
operating system.
     To use HOST, type HOST followed the
host name (or any abbreviation) you want
to look for, or the host number, and
return.  The program will print all
hosts (and nicknames) which match the
input specification.  A null
specification will type out the entire
host table, but only if you are logged
in.  For example:
        .HOST MIT-MC
(describe MIT-MC)
        .HOST CMU
(describe all CMU sites)
        .HOST 36.40.0.194
(describe Internet host 36.40.0.194)
        .HOST 50#302
(describe SU Ethernet host 50#302)
        .HOST                   (print
out the host table)
Note that even non-unique abbreviations
are accepted.  For example "SU" will
print out ALL of the Stanford University
hosts.  This is different from TELNET,
etc., which only accept abbreviations
which are unique to a single host.
