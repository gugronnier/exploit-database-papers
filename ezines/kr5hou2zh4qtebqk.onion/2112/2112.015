eL FREAKO WILL ALWAYS BE THE STRANGEST PERSON I HAVE EVER 
MET. HE WAS AT ONCE ORIGINAL AND INTELLIGENT; A PERSON 
POSSESSING MANY TALENTS.  I FIRST MET eL FREAKO AT MY COUSIN 
GREGG'S HOUSE. GREGG'S SISTER KIM BROUGHT FREAKO OVER. HE 
WAS HER MOST RECENT BOYFRIEND, AND RIGHT OFF, EVERYONE 
LIKED HIM.  PEOPLE WERE ALWAYS STRUCK BY FREAKO'S 
APPEARANCE, WITH HIS INTENSELY BRIGHT ORANGE-DYED AFRO AND 
THE STRANGE QUESTION-MARK TATTOO ON HIS CHEST.  HE WAS ALSO 
MUCH TALLER THAN EVERYONE AROUND HIM, AND SO HE WAS HARD TO 
FORGET.  I GUESS I WAS AS FASCINATED WITH HIM AS ANYONE 
ELSE THAT NIGHT.

FREAKO SEEMED ALL AT ONCE, AFFABLE AND KIND, YET STRANGELY 
INTENSE.  HE WAS QUITE EASY TO TALK TO, AND HE WOULD 
CAPTIVATE YOU WITH HIS STORIES OF FOREIGN LANDS, STRANGE 
MUSIC, PEOPLE OF GREAT INTELLIGENCE, AND HIS OWN 
MISCHIEVOUS ESCAPADES.  YET THROUGH ALL OF THIS EASY 
BANTER, HE SEEMED TO CARRY A SENSE OF BEAUTY AND NOBILITY. 
FREAKO WAS LIKE A FRESH BREEZE BLOWING THROUGH OUR STALE 
LITTLE WORLD.  PERHAPS THAT IS WHY HE HAD TO DIE.

SOCIETY SELDOM TOLERATES PEOPLE LIKE THAT.  IN SMALL DOSES, 
IT ALLOWS THE PEOPLE TO REBEL AND BREAK WITH THE NORMS, BUT 
THE IDEA OF TOTALLY UNRESTRICTED THOUGHT AND ACTION WILL 
NEVER BE TOLERATED.  I WASN'T REALLY SHOCKED WHE HE WAS 
KILLED.  IT HAPPENS ALL THE TIME.  A UNIQUE AND INNOCENT 
PERSON DIES BECAUSE OF HIS FELLOW MAN'S INABILITY TO ACCEPT 
HIM. 

SEE, FREAKO BEGAN HANGING OUT WITH US, AND BY THE TIME KIM 
HAD GROWN TIRED OF HIS OVERLY-COMPLICATED CONVERSATIONS AND 
MORALLY TINGED SEXUAL BELIEFS, HE HAD BECOME A CORNERSTONE 
OF OUR LITTLE SLICE OF SOCIETY.  WE TOOK HIM WITH US TO THE 
CLUBS AND COFFEE SHOPS, BUT THOSE PLACES WEREN'T HIS SCENE. 
HE WAS ALWAYS MORE COMFORTABLE IN THE DESOLATE (AND 
CONSEQUENTLY DANGEROUS) PARTS OF TOWN.  FREAKO LOVED 
NOTHING BETTER THAN TO GATHER US BY THE DOZENS AND TAKE US 
TO SOME GOD-FORSAKEN INDUSTRIAL PARK, TOWERS BELCHING 
POLLUTION AND ALL, AND JUST BEGIN TO GIVE SOME KIND OF 
SERMON ON THE IMPORTANCE OF HONESTY, OR THE NECESSITY OF 
REALIZING EMOTIONS. 

HE COULD SUMMON UP A HELL AND BRIMSTONE MONOLOGUE ABOUT 
SQUASHING A BEETLE IF HE WANTED TO.  THAT IS PROBABLY WHY 
WE ALL DEFERRED TO HIM SO MUCH.  HOW COULD ANYONE, HOW 
COULD WE, BE SO PASSIONATE ABOUT LIFE?  IT WAS REALLY 
EXILLERATING TO HEAR HIM WHEN HE TALKED LIKE THAT.  WE 
SEEMED TO HAVE PURPOSE WHEN HE WAS WITH US.  AND IT WASN'T 
A SUBSERVIENT OR EMULATORY FEELING EITHER.  IT WAS AS IF HE 
SHOWED US WHAT WE COULD DO IF WE LOOKED IN OURSELVES.  HE 
WAS A HELL OF A TEACHER. 

WHY I DIDN'T SEE IT COMING?  I SHOULD HAVE BEEN THE ONE. 
ME, THE CYNIC, THE SEPTIC.  BEFORE HIM, I LED MY FRIENDS 
INTO TROUBLE AND MISCHIEF WITH DAMN NEAR NIHILISTIC GLEE.  
I NEVER CONSIDERED TRYING TO USE MY INTELLECT FOR ANYTHING 
PRODUCTIVE, BECAUSE THAT ALWAYS MEANT SOMETHING BORING.  
ART AND CREATING MEANT DOING THE SORTS OF THINGS THAT WERE 
ACCEPTABLE TO THEM.  I NEVER KNEW IT COULD ABOUT THINGS 
THAT I FOUND INTERESTING OR BEAUTIFUL.  FREAKO SHOWED ME 
THAT.  GUESS, HE CONNECTED WITH THE PART OF ME THAT USED TO 
LOVE TO COLOR IN KINDERGARDEN.  MY TEACHERS LATER IN LIFE, 
WOULD ALL REMEMBER ME AS A HELLION I SUPPOSE, BUT NOT MY 
FIRST TEACHER.  SHE REMEMBERED ME AS AN ARTIST.

WELL, I SUPPOSE I SHOULD TELL YOU HOW IT HAPPENED.  SEE.. 
WE WERE ALL WALKING DOWN THE STREETS OF THE CITY, FREAKO IN 
THE MIDDLE OF OUR PACK, AND THESE REDNECK BASTARDS BEGAN 
SHOUTING AT US.  WE WERE ALL IGNORING THEM, CONTINUING ON 
AND MINDING OUR OWN BUSINESS, BUT FREAKO ALWAYS SEEMED TO 
CRAVE THE CONFRONTATION.  HE GOT SOME VISCERAL THRILL OUT 
OF CLASHING WITS AGAINST OTHERS.  HE BEGAN LAYING INTO THEM 
WITH A BRILLIANTLY INSIGHTFUL LINE OF THOUGHT ATTACKING 
THEIR ROLES IN SOCIETY.

THE REDNECKS COULD NOT COMPREHEND FREAKO'S WORDS, BUT COULD 
FEEL THEIR SINCERITY AND FEROCIOUS CORRECTNESS.  IT WAS 
INEVITABLE THAT THEY WOULD TRY TO JUMP HIM LATER, BUT 
FREAKO JUST WASN'T CONCERNED WITH HIS OWN SAFETY.  HE FELT 
THAT IT WAS HIS DUTY TO EDUCATE AND DEFEND HIS BROTHERS 
FROM THE OPPRESSION OF SMALL MINDS.  BEING DIFFERENT WAS 
HIS DUTY AND HIS GIFT, FOR NO ONE COULD EVER DO GOOD, OR SO 
HE FIGURED, IF THEY WERE PART OF THE FLOCK.  OH, SURE THEY 
MIGHT BE PRODUCTIVE, AND WITH THE EFFORTS OF THE REST OF 
THE FLOCK, THEY WOULD KEEP THE WORLD MOVING, BUT THEY COULD 
NEVER DO ANYTHING TO EXPAND MANKIND'S BOUNDARIES. 

THE FIRST BLOWS WOULD NOT COME UNTIL WE WERE FORCED TO 
LISTEN TO A BARRAGE OF INSULTS, MOSTLY CONCERNED WITH 
FREAKO'S SEXUAL PREFERENCE, AND HIS MOTHER'S BEDROOM 
HABITS.  FREAKO, AS IF NOT EVEN HEARING THEIR INSULTS, 
TRIED TO PASS, BUT A BIG GUY WOULD NOT LET HIM.  HE TRIED 
TO GO ANOTHER WAY, BUT AGAIN WAS STOPPED BY ONE OF THESE 
RURAL PHILISTINES.  FREAKO WAS VERY TALL AND STRONG, AND 
MOST LIKELY COULD HAVE FORCED HIS WAY PAST, BUT HE SEEMED 
TO REALIZE THAT WE WERE OUTNUMBERED.  IN THOSE DAYS, MY 
GANG NUMBERED ONLY ABOUT THIRTEEN.  THE REDNECKS HAD ABOUT 
THAT MANY GUYS IN JUST ONE OF THE MANY PICKUP TRUCKS 
ARRAYED BEFORE US. 

SO, FREAKO JUST STOOD THERE IN THE MIDDLE OF THE STREET, 
FACING THESE PUNKS WITH A LOOK OF NOBILITY AND, IN MY 
OPINION, JUST A LITTLE BIT OF FEAR.  FREAKO WAS SO 
PASSIONATE ABOUT HIS LIFE, AND THE LIVES OF HIS FRIENDS, 
THAT HE MUST HAVE BEEN VERY UPSET TO FACE A PHYSICAL 
CONFRONTATION OF THIS SORT.  HE NEVER REALLY EXPLAINED IT 
TO ME, BUT YOU COULD TELL THAT HE HAD DEEP PACIFISTIC 
FEELINGS.  I STILL LIKE TO THINK THAT IT WAS BECAUSE HE WAS 
TOO SENSITIVE TO EVER HARM ANOTHER PERSON. 

I MEAN, HE HAD NO COMPUNCTIONS ABOUT LAYING INTO SOMEBODY 
WITH WORDS, BUT THE THOUGHT OF ACTUALLY STRIKING AND 
HURTING ANOTHER, JUST, WELL, I CAN'T IMAGINE HIM EVER DOING 
IT THAT'S ALL.  HIS MIND SEEMED TO BE FREER THAN MOST OF 
THE TUGGINGS OF EGO AND PRIDE.  HE KNEW CONFIDENCE AND 
HUMILITY WELL, BETTER THAN ANY OF US.  AND SO EVERYTHING HE 
SAID GAINED RESPECT FROM IT'S VALIDITY AND INSIGHTFULNESS. 
FROM ITS TRUE WORTH RATHER THAN IT'S PACKAGING.

I ALSO THINK THAT HE TRULY LOVED HIS FELLOW MAN. EVEN THESE 
REDNECKS.  HE SOUGHT NOT TO HARM THEM, BUT TO PLEAD WITH 
THEM TO CHANGE THEIR WAYS.  I ALSO THINK THAT HE BOTH 
REALIZED AND THRIVED ON THE FUTILITY OF IT.  HIS PASSION 
AROSE FROM HIS LOVE FOR THEM, AND FOR US.  IF THEY WOULD 
HAVE ALLOWED IT, I KNOW HE WOULD HAVE GLADLY INCLUDED THEM 
IN THE DISCUSSION.
                                                          
YET HOW COULD THOSE REDNECKS APPRECIATE HIS UNIQUNESS?  
THEY ALL LOOKED ALIKE, THEY ALL TALKED ALIKE.  THE MUSIC 
BLARING OUT OF THE IDENTICAL PICKUPS WAS BUT A SLIGHT 
VARIATION ON A THEME.  THEY WERE LIKE ANTS.  ADMITTEDLY, 
ANTS WITH ENORMOUS EGOS AND A SORT OF BACKWOODS AIR ABOUT 
THEM, BUT JUST AS DANGEROUS.  HOW THEY ACTED COULD BE 
PREDICTED WITH A GREAT DEGREE OF CERTAINTY, HAD ANYONE 
BOTHERED TO STUDY THEIR BEHAVIOR, FOR THEY ALWAYS DID THE 
SAME THING.  NOT ONE OF THESE YOUNG MEN COULD LOOK AT 
SOMEONE AS DIFFERENT AS eL FREAKO AND  UNDERSTAND.  THEIR 
BRAINS JUST WOULDN'T ALLOW IT.  NOT EVEN THE SMARTER OR 
MORE SENSITIVE ONES, FOR THEIR FRIENDS WERE HAVING NONE OF 
IT, AND NEITHER COULD THEY. 

PEOPLE LIKE THAT CAN BE DANGEROUS, NOT SO MUCH AS 
INDIVIDUALS, BUT AS A COLLECTIVE.  AS ONE THEY POSE LITTLE 
THREAT TO ANYONE EXCEPT POSSIBLY THEIR DATES.  IT IS ONLY 
IN THESE ROVING GROUPS THAT THEY CAN EVER GROW DANGEROUS.  
FREAKO PROVOKING THEM WITH HIS BITING ACCUSATIONS ABOUT 
HUMAN NATURE AND THE NARROWING PATH THEY TROD UPON, DID 
NOTHING BUT INTENSIFY THE INEVITABLE CONFRONTATION.

THE CORONER STATED THAT THE CAUSE OF DEATH WAS BLUNT TRAUMA 
TO THE HEAD.  I REMEMBER THE PROSECUTOR AT BILLY MAYBURN'S 
TRIAL HOLDING THE TIRE IRON UP FOR THE JURY TO SEE.  WE SAT 
THERE, IN THAT COURT WAITING FOR JUSTICE, BUT INSTEAD 
WATCHED AS THE BOY'S LAWYER, HIRED BY HIS FUCKING FATHER, 
DISMISSED THE INCIDENT AS SELF DEFENSE.  "ALAN PRATCHETT 
WAS A TROUBLED YOUNG MAN, NEVER AT HOME, CONSTANTLY ROAMING 
THE STREETS, MOST LIKELY A JUNKIE.  IT WAS DARK, MR. 
MAYBURN HERE WAS OUT HAVING FUN WITH HIS FRIEND'S AFTER A 
LONG WEEK AT SCHOOL, WHEN THE DECEASED APPROACHED HIM.  
WHAT WAS HE TO DO?  WITNESSES HAVE TESTIFIED THAT THE 
DECEASED WAS VERBALLY ABUSIVE.  HOW COULD MR. MAYBURN OR 
HIS THREE COMPANIONS HOPE TO STAND UP TO THIS BULLY, OR HIS 
GANG OF THIRTEEN?"

IT DIDN'T TAKE LONG BEFORE WE GOT OURSELVES REMOVED FROM 
THE COURTROOM.  AND SO FOUND OUT THAT FREAKO WOULD GO 
UNAVENGED THE NEXT DAY IN THE PAPER.  WE NEVER KNEW WHY 
FREAKO'S PARENTS REFUSED TO SPEAK UP FOR HIM.  ALL THEY 
COULD SAY WAS HOW HE WAS NEVER HOME, AND DRESSED AND ACTED 
SO STRANGELY.  THEY MUST NOT HAVE TAKEN OUR TESTIMONY VERY 
SERIOUSLY EITHER.  WE HATED IT THAT MR. MAYBURN, THE BIG 
DOCTOR, WAS ABLE TO SUBVERT THE TRUTH IN THAT WAY.  SINCE 
HE COULD HIRE A BIGSHOT CITY LAWYER FOR HIS SON, JUSTICE 
WOULD NOT BE HEARD.

FREAKO WAS BURIED IN THE CITY CEMETERY.  BESIDES US, AND 
HIS BLANK FACED PARENTS, NO ONE WAS IN ATTENDANCE.  WE 
COULD NOT BELIEVE THE WAY HE WAS BEING TREATED.  HE WAS 
TWENTY TIMES THE PERSON THAT ANY OF HIS ACCUSERS OR JUDGES, 
WERE THE POPULACE READING THEIR SUBURBAN NEWSPAPER, COULD 
EVER BE. HE WAS SOMEONE SPECIAL.  AN INTELLECT, A SOUL; A 
TRUE INDIVIDUAL IN THIS HORRIBLE TOWN.  HE WAS NOT AFRAID 
TO STAND OUT, SOMETHING THAT IS DIFFICULT FOR MOST PEOPLE.  
AND IN BEING THIS WAY, HE INSPIRED US AND HELPED US TO BE 
LESS AFRAID.  I REMEMBER HOW WE WANTED TO TELL EVERYONE.  
WE WANTED TO TELL THEM ABOUT WHAT FREAKO WAS REALLY LIKE, 
BUT I GUESS THEY THEY FELT THE SAME WAY ABOUT US TOO.

AND SO HE DIED. FREAKO, AN APT NAME FOR SUCH A STRANGE 
PERSON.  HE STOOD OUT, WAS AN INDIVIDUAL, SOMETHING THAT IS 
SUPPOSED TO BE GOOD.  IN THE END THOUGH, IT JUST MADE HIM A 
BETTER TARGET.  I HOPE THAT I CAN TRY TO LIVE UP TO WHAT HE 
WANTED FOR US.  HIS WAY WAS KIND AND GENTLE. HIS RESPECT 
AND PEACE, A GOOD ALTERNATIVE TO THE TRIED AND FLAWED 
TRADITIONAL WAY.  AND WHENEVER I FEEL SCARED OR WORTHLESS, 
I WILL SAY A LITTLE PRAYER FOR eL FREAKO, AND THEN MY FEAR 
WILL BE GONE.


--------ADDENDUM

IT'S BEEN SIX YEARS SINCE HIS DEATH.  I DON'T KNOW WHY I'M 
WRITING IN THIS THING AGAIN, I JUST GUESS I FELT LIKE 
WORKING SOME OF THESE FEELINGS OUT OF MY SYSTEM.  I HAVEN'T 
REALLY KEPT HIS MEMORY VERY WELL.  ANY OF US.  POLICE, 
SCHOOL, PARENTS, STREET CRIMINALS.  THEY ALL WANT TO HURT 
US, JUST LIKE THEY DID HIM.  IT'S NOT SAFE FOR US IN THIS 
TOWN ANY MORE.

THEY ALL THINK WE'RE A BUNCH OF JUNKIE SKINHEADS, AND SO 
THEY HARASS US.  WE CANNOT FIND PEACE, OR RESPECT FOR OUR 
OLD FRIEND'S MEMORY.  AND SO WE HAVE BECOME WHAT WE NOW 
ARE.  A GANG.  A GANG OF THUGS WALKING THE STREETS, LOOKING 
OUT FOR EACH OTHER.  WE HAVE NO CHOICE REALLY.  EVERYONE AT 
SCHOOL TRIES TO PICK FIGHTS, THE POLICE ARE CONSTANTLY 
STOPPING US.  I SUPPOSE THAT WE JUST AREN'T MADE FROM THE 
SAME STUFF THAT HE WAS.  LANAI'S PARENTS SHIPPED HER OFF TO 
A PRIVATE SCHOOL IN NEW YORK STATE, AND THEN THERE'S SID.. 
HE WAS ARRESTED ONE NIGHT FOR ALLEGED DRUG POSSESSION AND 
WAS FOUND BEATEN TO DEATH IN HIS JAIL CELL THE NEXT DAY.

WHAT A LOVELY WORLD WE LIVE IN.  A FEW GIRLS HANG OUT WITH 
US, SOME CREEPS WHO LIKE TO FEEL TOUGH, BUT OUR KIND 
MOSTLY.  WE'VE TAKEN TO SHAVING OUR HEADS FOR THE 
INTIMIDATION FACTOR, AND SO THEY CALL US SKINHEADS.  STUPID 
BASTARDS, DREW AND ALEX ARE BLACK, AND DREW THOUGHT OF THE 
IDEA.  AT THE LEAST THEY DON'T BOTHER US SO MUCH ANYMORE, 
BUT WE CAN HEAR THEM WHISPER ABOUT US BEHIND OUR BACKS.  AT 
LEAST THEY FUCKIN KNOW WHO'S IN CHARGE. WE'RE NOT GONNA 
TAKE SHIT FROM ANYONE.  NEVER AGAIN WILL ONE OF US DIE OR 
BE PERSECUTED FOR BEING DIFFERENT. 

NOT WITHOUT A FIGHT AT LEAST. 
        SORRY FREAKO, BUT YOU WERE JUST ONE OF THE MANY 
        VICTIMS.  YOU WERE A SPECIAL PERSON; DECENT AND 
        HONEST, BUT YOUR PHILOSOPHY JUST DOESN'T WORK.  
        AH.. FUCK IT.  THIS WAS A MISTAKE...
