Once upon a time there was a giant grape.  This was no 
ordinary giant grape.  It was a large giant grape.  The grape 
was the culmination of years of work by the grape people.  The 
grape people were hard workers for they worked hard.  The king 
of the grape people, King Seed, and the queen of the grape 
people, Queen Wine, were loved by their constituents.  
Although the grape people had a monarchy they elected their 
monarchs every 2 years.  Seed and Wine were elected for life.  
Every two years the King and Queen were elected for life.  His 
seediness one day decided to undergo the giant grape project.  
  "Grape people," he cried, "come build my giant grape."  
And the people listened to him for he was their elected 
monarch for life.  And so the grape people began to labor 
on the grape.  Day in and day out they worked building the 
giant grape out of giant grape materials.  Never did the 
grape people consider the point of building a giant grape.
They did it because their elected monarch told them to.  
Every day the giant grape became larger and larger.  Yet it 
was empty and without juice.
  The king said "Grape people, give yourself up for the 
giant grape.  Donate your juice for the juice of all."  And 
the grape people listened to him for he was their elected 
monarch for life.  And slowly the giant grape filled with 
grape juice as thousands of innocent grapes sacrificed 
themselves for the giant grape.  Poverty bestruck the land 
for the workers were dying and the focus of the nation was 
concentrated on the giant grape.  The king cried "Destitute 
grape people, drink the grape juice from the giant grape." 
  And the grape people listened to him for he was their 
elected monarch for life.
