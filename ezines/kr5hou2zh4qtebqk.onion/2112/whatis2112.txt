"What is 2112?" 
by Gaurdian

Indeed, "2112" has all the nescessary criteria for an emotional impact.

Not only does it have the palindromic significance, but it does use
the best possible visual stimulus.  The '1's have a sleek bar-like
quality, suggesting a central cage or box or fence-like object.
The '2' is one of the better digits, as it combines the natural
beauty of the straight-line with the curious curve on one end and
the jagged, pattern-breaking accute angle at the other.  The '2'
imparts the feeling of ancient script, while the ones give a
balancing modern flavor.

In addition, '1's and '2's are often thought of as interchangable
with '0's and '1's.  This gives it a modern, mechanically cyberish
binary symbolism.  In this age of freedom through electronic
information, the opening thoughts on this symbolism clash with the
boxed in visual imagery, and set up a state of mental flux, in which the
viewer's emotions bounce back and forth between the themes...

Lastly, there is a marvelous verbal impact.  When reading
"two one one two" aloud in the mind, the first "two one" can
blend together into a single meta-syllable, a word separate
unto itself.  This leaves the remaining "one" and "two"
separate.  Again, this unbalanced feel clashes with a
contradictory mental construct: that of palindromic
symmetry.  

The emotional strain of these three points build together
in a Collassus of psycholigical uncertainty and chaos.
The effect is stunning.
