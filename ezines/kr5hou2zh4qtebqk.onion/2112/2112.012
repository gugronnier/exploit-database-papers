I must say that I am a disgruntled former employee.

I worked for JCPenny's for 8 months, and during that time I 
learned a great deal about their security and cash handling 
practices.  


Reconnaissance                           
ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ

First, become acquainted with the store you will be using.  
Visit it a few days before.  Roam around - know where all the 
different departments are located and what items they carry.

Most of the sales employees won't care what you do - they just 
want to go home or to lunch, but the few who care will watch 
you like a hawk.  Stupid, self-important employees are often 
overly cautious and very paranoid, and won't be reasonable.

When you make your inspection, buy something.  You can have 
someone return it later.

Don't stay in the store for over 30 minutes.  Casually scope 
the ceiling for the cameras - they use them.  Try to dress 
nicely, be clean-cut, and if you have long hair, tuck it under 
your hat.

They often single out young people based on the way they 
look.  This is especially true for minorities, so be careful 
if you're hispanic or black.

The Refund
ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ

To preform the refund you must know these things: what item 
you wish to swap, where it's located and what your size would 
be in that item.  In this walk through we'll use denim jeans, 
which, by the way, is what I suggest for use.

The refund is executed by walking into the store either 
empty-handed or with a empty bag, picking up four identical 
pairs of jeans 2 or 4 inches too small or large, then walking 
to the register and requesting a refund, citing that your 
aunty bought you the wrong size birthday present.  Take the 
cash and head for the door.  Be courteous and impatient, if 
you're a good enough actor to combine the two effectively.
  
Example: You wear size 30-30 jeans. You enter the store 
through the package pickup door.  The western wear 
department (which also handles jeans) is near.  You walk 
briskly, but not hurriedly, to the table or rack containing 
your jeans and grab 4 pairs of size 30-36 jeans, which 
obviously wouldn't fit you, but Aunt Betty might not 
realize the difference.  You walk to the counter, deliver
your spiel, and wait for your cash.  Management might be 
called to get change - don't worry. You don't need a reciept 
to get a refund at Penny's.

The only red flag is if the salesperson gets a call as soon as 
you approach the register.  This would be security, who has 
been watching you, possibly watching you pick the jeans up.  
The security guy might tell her to answer in "yes" or "no" 
only.  He might tell her to say, "No thanks, I don't need any 
change."

If this happens, it's still not over.  

They can't bust you until you have "lost the opportunity to 
pay for the merchandise," which means you are past the nearest 
register on your way to the exit.  Come back to the register 
later, and perhaps ask to exchange one pair of jeans because 
you don't want 4 pair of black 505s.  This is the most secure 
method of ripping them off.
  

Shoplifting
ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ

Harder to get away with, shoplifting has many variations, only 
a few of which only a few will be discussed here.
  
A. The All Out, Balls to the Wall Shoplift

When shoplifting, always have a car waiting right outside, 
headed toward the exit of the mall parking lot, ready to go. 
Enter the store with a few of your buddies, grab everything 
and haul ass out the door.

Example: You have a truck sitting in position (heading out of 
the parking lot, at the exit, motor running, in drive).  You 
and 3 other guys run in through the west entrance near 
dresses. You grab a shitload of prom dresses and formals and 
head out the door. You throw the shit in the back of the 
truck and take off.  

I know of no practical methods, however, which would allow 
you to convert the merchandise to cash - trying to get a 
refund the same store wouldn't be very wise, and you'd join 
the ranks of the really stupid thieves who made the news for 
pulling shit like that.  A JCPenny's in a different city may 
work if you returned only one item, or two unrelated ones, and 
didn't wait too long to do it - if you show up with half a 
dozen things which have been out for a couple months, it would 
be rather suspicious.
 

B. The Sneak Shoplift

This technique requires some minor sleight of hand to sneak 
the merchandise off.  If you like ties, cologne, or your 
girlfriend doesn't mind getting perfume without the box, 
this is fairly easy - wear a heavy, dark-colored long-sleeved 
button-down shirt (with your own tie) and leave the middle 
two buttons unfastened, hidden by your tie.  Don't tuck it in 
flat.. leave space for the single object you will take.  A 
clean baseball cap would be a good idea, as well.  It's a
weird look, but I know guys that dress like this normally.
Perfect your economy of motion - getting an object inside your 
shirt smoothly from a normal position.  If you can move your 
hand across your torso and slip and item inside without 
slowing down, you'll do.  It need not be perfect, but it's 
your ass.. so make sure you get something good.  Drakkar Noir 
really sucks.  Free promotional gifts for fragrance purchases 
of over $19.95 in value are out of the question, unfortunately.


The shoplifting techniques are not new information.  At best, 
they're variations of age-old techniques which everyone 
(including salespeople) knows about.  There are many more ways 
to shoplift.  It's kind of an art, perhaps even an athletic 
competition - but the rush one feels is due to too much danger 
for too little reward.. which brings us directly into the 
solution for this quandary, Technique #3.


#3 The Register Break In

This one is much easier than you'd think, and fast (a solid 7 
seconds if you're dextrous).  It will take at least that much 
time to get the register open, take the money, and splitting.  
Having a car waiting would still be an excellent idea - this 
is greater reward for greater danger.
					     
At JCPenny's, there are several basic single-key commands to 
the register.  

 Key    Purpose
ÚÄÄÄÂÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ¿

³   ³    buy something..)                    ³

³ 3 ³    No Sale, what you're there for.     ³
ÀÄÄÄÁÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÙ

When an empolyee wants to open the register without making a 
transaction he types "3".  The register then pauses, waiting 
for his Employee Number, which is 3 digits.  He doesn't have 
to type his number in, though, because the machine recalls the 
last employee who used the register - that number is already 
displayed as the default.  Pressing ENTER selects it. So to 
execute a "No Sale", an employee would type "3" and then ENTER 
twice.        

That's all one has to do to open the register. 
If there is a problem and it asks for a number, any 3 digit 
number will work.  Use 999 - it's the default employee number, 
commonly used when an employee wants to refund an item without 
losing their commission (they steal, too).

At JCPenny's the registers often run out of change.  People 
want refunds or whatever.  If you watch closely, when an 
employee calls for change, you will see a merchandiser go to 
an unoccupied nearby register to get it.  These registers are 
"change registers" and are perfect for the Register Break In.

Example: You noticed in your inspection that the lingerie 
register is a "change register".  Walking up to the register 
when no one is looking, you hit 3 and then ENTER twice.  The 
register drawer pops open - you grab all the paper money out 
of the slots and from under the black case, dumping it into a 
bag.  You get out the door and into the waiting car by
whatever means seems most appropriate, be it hauling ass or
walking briskly.. taking it slow and casual could get you 
tackled from behind, but running could draw attention when 
your criminal action did not.

Dangerous?  As hell.  Once again, it's your ass - robbing a 
register is a completely different episode of Cops than petty 
shoplifting.
