Ante mare et terras et quod tegit omnia coelum   
unus erat toto naturae vultus in orbe    
quen dixere Chaos: rudis indigestaque moles.

  IN THE BEGINNING, there was me.  I was staring at the 
blackness within me, and an idea struck me.  Then I created 
the universe.  This one, anyway.  Care for a tour?
  Look, there's Earth.  Yeah, it's flat.  I've always said 
there's only one down in any sensible universe.  The stars are 
the same, though, and most of the continents are there.  Is 
that better?
  See the littlest continent, there?  That's Australia.  Okay, 
so it's been done before, but this one's different.  Get a 
little closer, and you'll see what I mean.
  Ah.  There's the village we want... And _there's_ Andrew.  
Have you ever seen a finer specimen of man?  No neanderthals 
for me, I tell you.  I thought about the evolution bit, but if 
you want to know a secret, building _homo sapiens_ right from 
the start is actually cheaper.  It's true!  My humans know 
exactly where they stand in the universe... There'll never see 
a holy war on _my_ planet, so in the end, I save.  Right, 
Andrew?
  "Right," he says.
  I see that that disturbed you.  Sorry.  I don't get many 
visitors. Sometimes I forget that gods aren't always 
comfortable with humans.
  What?  Gods?  Oh.  That's what they call regular people.  It's funny
what one learns when one actually listens to the little creatures.
  "Right," says Andrew.  Sorry.
  As I was saying, I made these particular humans fully aware 
of their situation.  They know they're characters in my story, 
just as we know we'd be nothing without the imagination of the 
Celestial Author.  In a way, we Creators are just striving for 
our own chance at the divine.
  You like that?  Well, you can quote me, then.  Incidentally, 
you are getting my name right, aren't you?  It's H'thuddamok - 
with two D's.  Two.  D's.  Right.
  Where was I?  Oh, yes.  Humans.  I don't want to sound like 
I'm speaking for every Narrator in existence.  In fact, I'm 
hardly what you'd call a mainstream Creator.  But you know 
that - why would a leading journalist visit one so common as 
the ruler of a universe if there wasn't something unique about 
his work?
  Let me just cut to the chase, then.  Pardon?  Oh, it's a 
human phrase dealing with motion pictures.  See, the chase 
scene was traditionally the most... Forgive me.  I don't mean 
to heap all these technical terms on you.  A "chase" is just a 
part of the action in a human story.  They tend to go on with 
plots and action..
  Plot?  I can see I'm confusing you.  Most of your readers 
wouldn't understand all these humanisms, so why don't we just 
skip it?  If you're really interested, though, I can lend you 
a great human-culture story.
  Ah.  Well, you're welcome.
  As I was saying, why don't I just get to the point?  I think 
the main reason my work has caused so much attention in 
Creationist circles is that my humans, despite their inherent 
shortcomings, act and are treated as if they were regular 
people.
  Most Gods are a little afraid of what their humans could 
become.  When people think of humans, they think of stupidity, 
wickedness, sloth, and greed.  No one wants to let filthy 
creatures like _that_ in on the secrets of the universe. 
There'd be chaos!
  I prefer to think that humans are just misunderstood.  Maybe 
they're such savages _because_ they don't know what's going 
on.  I mean, apart from their low intelligence level and those 
peculiar fifth fingers, there's not much difference -  
biologically speaking - between us and them.  Wouldn't you be 
a little unsociable if _you_ had to go through life not even 
knowing for sure where you came from or where you'd go once 
you die?
  "Excuse me," says Andrew.  "I know I'm just a human and all, 
but I've been to some of the Almighty H'thuddamok's (may he 
watch over us always) older worlds.  I've seen what it's like 
for humans who don't even know what their lives mean."
  He calls me Almighty!  Ha!  Humans so funny... Oh, but you'd 
like to hear more?  You could really use a few words from such 
a human in your article?  Then by all means, ask him what you 
will.
  No!  Of course he won't bite!
  "Well," he answers, "I suppose it's just like being anything 
else.  I can't even talk to you without the Almighty 
H'thuddamok to narrate.  I really don't know what it's like to 
be anything but what I am.  I'm sure it's not _that_ much 
different from whatever you're used to.  I feel perfectly 
normal."
  What?  It really bothers you, having characters talk in the 
present tense?  Okay, it's fixed.  Go on.
  Andrew, a tall young man with tan skin and green eyes and 
brown hair, scratched his head, pondering the question.  
"Well," he said, quietly, awed that he was speaking to not 
one, but two of the mighty beings which held the power to 
create their own universes. Being fully aware, he had created 
his own story to tell, but it was humble compared to the 
wondrous tales of -
  Eh?  My prose leaves much to be desired?  It's old 
equipment, and as you can see, I'm more into the theory of 
Creation than the practice.
  What?  Oh, yes.  I thought you knew. Of _course_ humans can 
have Creativity.
  "Really?" gasped Andrew.  "You'd really want to hear my 
story?"
  Very well!
  "Once upon a time," he said, "there was a land which 
contained some magic rocks.  They were very bad for people.  
There were some magicians who could used the rocks, though, 
because it turned out that lead could save them from the 
magic, and they just happened to have some lead clothing.  
Some of them made magic buildings which sent energy to people 
all over the land.  But other magicians made magic boxes that 
made big holes when dropped on people.  One day, one of the 
magic boxes made a very big hole indeed, and nearly everyone 
in the land suddenly ceased to exist.
  "The few survivors became nomads, and wandered the very 
fringes of the land searching for food, because the magic 
killed anyone who got too close.  Eventually, some nomads came 
upon the house of a magician whose building still made energy.
  "'Let us in,' they said to her, 'for you have more than you
need.'
  "The magician thought about it... And said, 'No.'
  "And they said, 'Aww... please?'
  "And she said, 'Mine are the only magic rocks left in the 
land, but I have enough to give energy to billions of people 
for billions of years.  But you've seen what the magic can do, 
when it's used for evil.  Prove to me that you are worthy, and 
I'll let you in.'
  "The nomads went away, but they took the message to heart. 
Thousands of years passed, and the descendants of the nomads 
finally settled in a far off land, and there was peace.  For 
the nomads had told their children to strive to become the 
best, the most honorable, the most kind.  When they died, they 
hoped that last great magician would deem them worthy, and 
bring them into her house.
  "None of them really knew _what_ happened after death, but 
one thing was clear: when the great-grandchildren of the 
great- grandchildren of those nomads discovered magic rocks in 
their new land, they really had changed.  They saw that the 
rocks were used for the good of everyone, and lived happily 
for countless generations more."
  Well, thank you Andrew.  That was nice.
  Hmm.. Kind of sappy you say?  Humans sometimes try to 
_teach_ with their stories, see...  No, not like the stories 
that tell you how to program a VCR.  Human stories sometimes 
are intended to make other humans think about their own 
lives.  That's just the way they are, I suppose.
  You say you have one last question before you go?
  The meaning of life?  For humans, you mean?  Same as ours, 
I'd guess.  To be the best they can be, so that when they 
reach that last chapter, they might be reborn.
  That's common sense, though.  I think what you're really 
asking is why do we do it?  Why do Creators bring the funny 
little things into existence to begin with?
  I think it has a lot to do with loneliness.  Humans give 
people reassurance.  I mean, maybe it's okay for us that no 
one's ever seen the Celestial Author.  We're very advanced 
people and can take it. But maybe, just maybe, we'd be just a 
little happier if we really knew for _certain_ that a sequel 
awaited us.
  Traditional humans have almost always had such a 
relationship with their Creators.  Other people are content to 
just imagine a world into existence and let the humans sort it 
out. I prefer to give them a little nudge.  So I let them know 
that they were simply figments of my imagination, and despite 
what everyone suspected, they took the news rather well.  
Perhaps someday, if the Celestial Author's watching, it will 
give _us_ a little nudge of its own.
  No, not likely.. But I keep hoping for the day...
  Oh, you're welcome.  I enjoyed this interview.  No, I 
understand. There's work to do, eh?  Anyway, I think there's 
some trouble about a Messiah in one of my worlds, and I really 
ought to get to it. 
  Oh?  Well, good luck with your story, too, my friend.
