                            ***

  I sat in a small booth in a dark corner of the club.  The 
sound was fucked up, and all I could hear was the vague 
droning of the guitar and the thump of the bass.  It was 
all so numbing to me that I guess I fell asleep.  I dreamed 
of being stabbed by a large dark-clothed man.  I felt 
powerless, then I woke up. 
  I'm not sure how the dream made me feel, but when I 
awoke, I just sat there for the longest time, staring at 
the floor.  At first I just looked at the dirty tiles.  
Soon however I noticed a cockroach walking in the open.  I 
thought it strange that the insect would be walking in the 
center of a room, and I watched as foot after foot landed 
around it.  With each footfall, the roach brushed with 
death.  I waited for the one that would snuff out its life.
  Before long I left the club, in whose company I cannot 
remember.  I went to a dingy little cafe, the only one to 
be found open so late, and had a greasy hamburger.  I can't 
remeber tasting the food, or the watery soda.  I just 
recall the pleasure of having something to eat.  I was 
alone with my thoughts.  Or I might as well have been, for 
my partner seemed reluctant to speak to me. 
  I understood his silence though.  My own thoughts annoyed 
me; swirling and spinning, my head ached with thoughts of 
pity and fear.  I couldn't quite tell from whence this fear 
came.  I just knew that something bad was going to happen.  
Or perhaps, I knew that it would not. Perhaps I thought 
that I might live, and never have anything happen.  
Whatever the cause, I was afraid.
  The waitress came by before long and asked me if I wanted 
a refill of soda.  I said yes, but knew I wouldn't drink 
it.  She must have said something else which I didn't hear, 
because when I noticed her leaving she was shaking her head 
and sort of rolling her eyes.  Before it could worry me too 
much, I was lost in my thoughts again.  I thought 
immediately of my old job.  I remembered some of the great 
feelings I had had there.  I remembered how it was around 
Christmas.  The smell, the sounds of customers.  I remember 
how the girl I had a crush on looked that day. 
  I was really enjoying the memory when my companion spoke 
up, and brought me back to reality.  "I've been wanting to 
talk to you," he said.  I wasn't all that curious, but I 
figured that I should ask, to be polite or something.  He 
looked at me for a moment, his eyebrow raised as he seemed 
to debate what he would say.  "Kip, I think of you as a 
very close friend.  I think, well, I've been talking to 
Jeremy and Sue, and we're worried about you.  We think you 
should see someone.  Someone who you can talk to, and who 
can help you."
  I thought about what he was saying and it almost made me 
angry.  I felt something for a moment, but then realized 
what he was doing.  I gave him a weak smile and took a 
drink of my soda.  I knew that he would persist with this 
until I answered him.  I don't even remember what I told 
him, it was the just the same spiel I gave to my parents 
when they brought the subject up.  I could say it without 
any real thought, as though I were on autopilot.  It was 
strange when I realized that I had been talking, and 
daydreaming at the same time.  Couldn't he tell? 
  I couldn't believe it that he bought the story.  I looked 
at him for a moment; I must have been staring him straight 
in the eyes, yet I was not really focusing.  I tend to do 
that a lot lately.  I will catch myself staring or 
daydreaming, even when I am talking to someone.  The other 
day it happened when I was driving.  I didn't think there 
was a problem though.  If they worried so much they could 
spend more time with me, too.  I hardly ever see them 
except in school.  It's summer now, and I never hear from 
Sue.  I'll be damned if it feels like I have any friends at 
all.
  I'm sure they care though.  ..damn, I was daydreaming 
again.  We're riding back in his car.  The trip takes a few 
hours, but I don't think he'll talk to me unless I start 
the conversation.  I'm not going to, either.  I want to 
figure some stuff out, and I know he would just belittle 
me.  It really annoys me that my personal problems aren't 
bad enough to share with my friends.  I wish I could meet a 
girl who wouldn't fuck me over and break my heart.  I wish 
I wasn't so shy and scared of everything.  But most of all, 
I wish that they would show me some support.  They still 
think I'm crazy, no matter what I tell them.  I am getting 
to the point that I don't bother any more.  They always 
gave me a hard time about Michelle.  They all told me what 
would happen.  Every day, I heard a new joke or insult.  I 
got so sick of it at times.  Now they all seem really 
satisfied. And since I'm not willing to kiss their asses, I 
guess I'll have to do without friends. 
  The fact is that she's all I think about anymore.  I can 
almost bring myself to hate her, until I remember something 
about her.  I start to recall all the things that I loved 
about her.  I remember what made me think she was the one.  
I thought she was different.  I want so badly to talk about 
her.  Why won't anyone listen?
  It's not silly, no matter what they say.  I never loved 
anyone before.  She was my first love, my best friend, the 
ideal woman.  How CAN I have any self respect left?  I 
treated her like a queen, delighted that she would even 
condescend to spend time with me.  When I was around her, I 
just couldn't help but feel happy.  That was real, no 
matter what anyone tries to tell me.
  How can they understand, though?  For them, it's easy. 
They meet people, they date, they make friends, they kiss, 
they live, love, sex, passion... Me?  I am alone.  If there 
is one fact I CAN be sure of, it's that.  Here I am sitting 
in a car with one of my closest friends, yet I am as alone 
as I have ever been.  I cannot share anything with him.  I 
am closed off.  He is, too.
  I sit there for a little longer, trying to remain deep in 
thought, but then for some reason, I say something.  I 
asked him if he's seen Sue recently.  He takes this as an 
invitation to lecture.  I frown, and sink back into my 
seat. It pisses me off, because I know that there is 
nothing I can say to stop him.  Part of my problem is that 
no one seems to respect me any more.  That really makes it 
hard to talk to people.
  So, he talks and I think about flying.  I hear 
occassional snippets, and respond with a "hmm.." or a 
"yeah, I hear ya'", but I am really thinking about soaring 
and wheeling in the inky darkness of the sky above me.  
It's not really even a dream of mine, just a sort of fancy 
that hits me.  I guess he doesn't notice because he's 
driving and all.  I don't remember when he stopped.
  The next day I sit in my room, reading a book.  I hear a 
knock at my door, and quickly tuck the book under the pile 
of papers and CDs on my desk.  "Yes," I call.  The door 
opens and there is my mom.  "Well, what do you want?" I 
would tell you more about that conversation or the one I 
fell into with my dad later on, but I refuse to talk about 
them.  It taxes my mind to even think about dealing with 
them.  I do a bunch of shit after that, not really worth 
mentioning. 
  I just sit there; no energy or enthusiasm.  I feel sort 
of excited when Mork and Mindy comes on.  I smile when I 
get a letter from my friend Lori in Spokane.  I probably 
feel glad or happy about several other things as well, but 
it isn't until the phone rings that night that I really 
feel a rush.  For some reason, I know it is her.  The 
things she has said, and the decisions I've made are 
forgotten as soon as I hear her voice.
  I suppose I should probably tell you what she said, but I 
know that that would be pointless.  The conversation is not 
overly long, nothing in fact like the six hour talks that 
would consumed my free time in the past.  She asks me 
"what's up", and though I detested the idea of talking to 
her about anything other than what had been said, I 
answered.  "Nothing".  If my whole fucking life isn't 
consumed by doing nothing.  The gates are closed, heaven is 
empty I thought.  Surely she will bring it up.  I'm tired 
of seeming weak.  I can't bring anything up.
  The word nothing came up a lot in the course of that 
phone call. 
  "What are you up to?" 
  "Nothing"
  "How's it going?"
  "Robert and I are going to see a movie tonight."
  ("I hate you" in a thought bubble above my head)  "That's 
nice."
  "Uhm.. what else are you going to do?" 
  "Nothing really."
  "Nothing.  Nothing.  You are nothing!"
  "What did you say?"
  "Nothing."
  I didn't imagine it. 
  The word "nothing" could characterize her call.  I came 
away feeling empty.  I didn't know where our relationship 
stood.  I didn't tell her finally how much I resented her. 
No, I said nothing.  Then I got to sit in my room and think 
about how much I actually hated her, while she went to a 
movie with that bastard Jeff.  Robert.  It doesn't matter.  
They're all the same to me, as long as it's NOT me. I hate 
her.
  I sit alone with my discordant thoughts for quite a 
while. I hardly notice as afternoon becomes night.  So much 
time passes, and soon it is quite late.  I feel worse when 
I look at the clock, for I realized that most people in the 
world (or my time zone at least) are asleep.  I feel even 
more alone then.  Sleep seems like death.  I need something 
to kill time.  A movie I've seen a million times will serve 
that purpose well.  The familiartity comforts me, as I 
watch these actors, who are more like brothers or friends 
than the real things have ever been.
  I guess two nights have passed in what I'm telling you, 
but I have to be honest and admit that I really don't know 
what the point is.  I feel lots of stuff, but I can never 
figure it out.  I will tell my computer.  My parents paid 
thousands of dollars for it.  The least it can do is listen 
to my problems.  So I type for a while.  It's a lovely 
morning.  Before long the door swings open and my father 
informs me that it is in actuality a lovely afternoon.  I 
figure it wouldn't be the time to discuss my feelings 
toward actuality.  He wouldn't get it, and the discussion 
would probably piss him off somehow. 
  I feel almost energetic.  I think I'll get a weird 
haircut to make my parents angry.  I think I forgot to make 
the appointment.  I find out later that I did make the 
appointment,  I just forgot to go.  Damn, I guess.  
  How can I live with a broken CD player?  I don't have 
anything to do but listen to music.  I guess I'll have to 
find a friend.  No, I hate all my friends, or something to 
that effect.
  So, before long it was night again. I was sitting in my 
room, watching tv.  I hate everything that is on tv, but 
what else is there to do?  I think about what I'll say if 
she calls again.  I sort of feel guilty for thinking about 
her at all. I  know she's not thinking about me.  Fuck her! 
  Oh god, did the phone just ring?  My dad is calling me!  
The call is for me!  Oh joy!
  I pick up the receiver and hear a male voice.  I almost 
curse audibly, but do not.  Oh great.  It's Jeremy, 
deigning to talk to me.  I would have felt quite honored 
had I not been planning his death at that moment.  So I 
answer his stupid question about college registration, and 
he hangs up.  I guess it was less hassle to call me than 
the collge. Fuck him.  I probably like him the least of all 
my friends. Wonder what it will be like when we're roommates?
  My life is boring.  I'll stop inflicting it on you soon.  
I guess the last telling thing that happened was when I saw 
both her and Denise in town.  I was really not in the mood 
to run into anyone, so of course I was destined to.  I 
thought getting cleaned up, and going to the city to look 
in some bookstores would cheer me up.  I ran into Denise at 
the gas station.  She was so friendly and beautiful.  I 
said hello and talked to her for a moment, conscious of 
every detail of her appearance.  I loved her so much.  She 
was in so many ways the perfect girl to me.  It was this 
perfection that always threw me, I guess.  She was the only 
really beautiful girl I had ever flirted with.  Seriously 
flirted, that is.  I wished I had asked her out so badly 
right then.  Oh well, she leaves and I pay. 
  Still, I can't stop thinking about her, and about 
Michelle.  I would have asked her out long ago, if only 
Michelle hadn't seemed so attracted to me.  I fell in love 
with her, and couldn't ask Denise out for fear of.. I don't 
really know why.  I just couldn't ask her out. Now it was 
too late.
  I tried to put her out of mind though, I really did.  It 
was just dumb luck I suppose, that I ran into Michelle and 
that fucking guy at the bookstore.  She saw me first of 
course, and had to come say hi.  I got to meet her friend 
and everything.  Hot damn.  She asked who I was with - fuck 
I hate her, smile and reply - "Oh, no one.  I guess I'll 
leave you two alone" - turn and hear - "wait, do you want 
to have coffee with us or something?" - God, please.. just 
smite me down right now.  Please!  I've never asked you for 
anything before - "Uhm.. yeah, that sounds like fun."
  Can anyone find a better reason to go on than to wait and 
see what tommorrow will bring?  I don't know.  I hate to 
sound cliched and hate everyone, but what am I to do?  I am 
trapped.  There is no way to escape, and I have prescious 
little "character" as grandpa would say, to change my 
ways.  It's too late to start over.  Thanks to my 
foresight, I have arranged to go to the same school that 
all of these people are going.  I will live in the same 
dorm.  I will share the same bathrooms, and in one case, 
the same room.  What are my options?  They won't stop 
treating me the way they do, and I can't break away from 
them either.  Michelle wants a "friend", and a friend I'll 
be, but I will hate her every moment I spend with her.
  I suppose I will get to escape my parents at least. I 
wonder what horribleness will replace the void they leave?  
I have turned to you my old friend, because I know you to 
be a good listener.  Whenever I turn to people I wind up 
feeling worse, but when I talk to you, I end up with 
something tangible.  In some ways, I wish real life could 
be more like the slick, cyberspace of the futurists. 
Wouldn't it be easier to exist in a virtual reality, where 
the body was irrelevent?
  How I dream.  To soar over graphical landscapes, and 
interract soley with the mind.  Love and friendship and 
morality and compassion have such radically different 
meanings there.  All the constraints I feel would be gone. 
Ahh well.  I have to do something now.  I guess I'll leave 
the virtual fantasy to my kids.. what a laugh.  May these 
fictional youngsters fare better than I.  I guess that is 
an empty prayer, as my chances of finding a mate seem so 
slim.  It would be more likely for me to achieve godhood 
and create them before I manage to do it the old-fashioned 
way.
