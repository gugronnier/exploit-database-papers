The panda ambled past a small gnome and began to chew 
contendedly upon a clutch of sweet bamboo shoots.  The gnome 
promptly stood on its hands and sprayed the panda with the 
pungent contents of its monoxydil gland.  The panda, already 
furry as hell, paid no attention.

  It's a foregone conclusion that I'm not a very normal 
person.  I began to realize this in early 1994, when I had
a week of extremely disturbing dreams.  I have a list of
nine.. to give you an idea of what to expect, this is a 
table of contents as I commonly refer to them:

   I. The Abortion Clinic Dream
  II. Catholics
 III. Parapalegic Warfare
  IV. Exorcism/Double Gibson
   V. People Full of Insects
  VI. Santa Claus and the Mouse Witch
 VII. At the Mall with a Spiked Club
VIII. Stuffed Animal Assassination
  IX. Piranha Happy Hour at the Local Nightclub


Scared yet?  They'll probably be pretty short, because I 
don't intend to make them into stories - I'll tell them 
like I saw them, inconsistencies and all.  It was my habit
to post the dreams in the message areas of my BBS as soon
as I awoke, so I'm working both from text written while I 
was still 'there' and from memory, since I didn't write 
every detail.. so here's the first.. 

  I. The Abortion Clinic Dream.

  The first impression I had was of the clinic, and how
spotless it was.  Everything was perfect.
  Then I walked in, about 40, tall, thin, with short black 
hair, wearing a white lab coat and black glasses.
  I knew upon sight that I was a good doctor.  The kind that 
instills confidence in you immediately.  Not just good.. 
great.  I knew my business, and I knew it well.
  I had made my appearance to talk to a woman and her
daughter, the woman about 45, the daughter 16 or so, not
yet visibly pregnant.  The daughter was pretty, as was her 
mother, but their faces were marked with worry.  They didn't 
know much about the procedure, so I suggested that we go 
discuss it.  
  As I said, I was a good doctor.
  We went to a comfortable room that was made just for that
purpose and sat around the table, reading pamphlets, and I
made sure everyone was completely informed.  I felt very
satisfied that I was doing such a good job - really adding
something to the doctor/patient relationship.
  After talking quietly for a while, the mother and daughter
decided that she would go through with it, and I nodded,
expressionless.  I would have felt the same if they had made
another decision, and would have then referred them to 
adoption agencies or special foundations.
  Instead, I guided the mother to the waiting room, and  
gently told her that it would be about 20 or 30 minutes.
  The girl had changed into a scrub-blue gown, the kind
that ties in the back, and was standing, looking nervous.
  I took her to a room farther down the hall, telling her
that this was the room where the procedure would take
place.
  I asked her to sit on the edge of the table, and she did.
  I helped her put her feet and ankles in the stirrups, 
which were cold metal.  She gave a slight gasp at the 
shock of the uncomfortable exposed position and the cold on 
her legs.
  I moved up the table to address her, again, considerately
and gently, asking if she were alright, and if she were 
ready to go on.  She took a deep breath, and said yes.
  I went to a metal drawer, and removed a speculum from the
cloth on which it lay.  I returned to her and inserted it 
carefully, so she'd adjust with the minimum discomfort.  
When she was ready, I opened her up.
  I then walked to a tank of cold, thick gel, removed a 
large white rat, and inserted it into her head-first.
  Then I went to get a cup of coffee.
