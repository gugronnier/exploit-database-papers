I will break the door of hell and smash the   
bolts; I will summon the dead to eat food
with the living, and the living shall be
outnumbered by the host of them.

A sliver of spinach sat intimidatingly on his upper front 
teeth.  He wore a new Armani suit, had perfectly slick hair
and the aroma of an expensive after-shave circling about 
him, but the bit of vegetable on his dental works 
detracted from these would-be positive aspects of his 
appearance to the point that he seemed less attractive 
than the gangly, buck-toothed MIT graduate sitting across 
the crowded restaurant.  His lunch companion noticed it, 
but out of fear of a social faux pas, she kept quiet.  He 
tried to impress her and went on and on about his 
supposedly important corporate occupation, his new 
sportscar, and described, in specific detail, the "deal" 
he had just wrapped up with a Japanese company, generating 
a large profit for the company, and possibly a promotion 
for himself.  During the course of his spiel, he never 
noticed the food on his teeth.  

She did, of course.  
 
All she could do was nod and half-smile, the way polite 
people do when they really don't care what someone is 
saying and are preoccupied with other things, like 
spinach, for instance.  The spinach was now ingrained to 
her psyche, stuck there like an embarrassing piece of 
toilet paper on the sole of your shoe after you leave the 
restroom that you don't notice until after fifteen 
minutes of snickering from strangers in the adjoining 
tables. 
 
"You should have seen me," he gushed, overconfidently.  
She attempted to turn her attention away from the leafy 
green goodness that perched atop his pearly whites by 
nervously fumbling through her purse.  She tried anything, 
so long as it might keep her from glancing at his mouth.  
His stories were boring, making the situation worse.  
Nothing else could keep her attention away from the 
intense carnage of vegetables in his orifice, and it ate 
away at her.  She squirmed in her seat, trying to avoid 
the uncomfortable situation. 
 
With each passing glance, the smidgen of flora seemed to 
increase in magnitude until it was the size of a cow.  It 
spoke to her in a stage whisper: "Come here Susan.  Stick 
your fingers in his mouth and pull me right out.  You know 
you want to."  It was tempting. However,  she refrained from 
performing an all-out assault on him.  What stopped her, 
she didn't know. 
 
After much nervous twitching, she attempted to tip him off 
to the atrocious particles of leafy greens that had taken 
a permanent residence between his two front teeth.

She licked her teeth, hoping he would see it and 
self-consciously perform the same task himself, thereby 
eradicating the entire uncomfortable predicament.  No such 
luck.  She tried again.  Once again, nothing.  For a short 
while longer, she again attempted to ignore it, but the 
sliver clenched at her throat and showed no mercy to her 
weakening manners. 
 
Then she saw her chance for salvation.  From the haze of 
the restaurant came Beano, their waiter.  Perhaps he could 
help.  

"More water, sir?"  Please, please, say yes.  Wash that 
stuff away.  Oh, God, please. 
 
"No thanks, just a check." 
 
She fell heartbroken.  Out of desperation, she performed 
the same tooth-licking operation, but he had no response 
to her silent pleas.  Her entire life had been filled with 
tragedies, but none more agonizing than this.  She had no 
where left to turn.  Her mind was a frenzy, her thoughts 
confused, everything became one large blur.  Then, out of 
complete frustration, fear, anger, and discomfort, she 
blurted. 
 
"Hey, you've got something on your teeth." 
 
He licked the incisors, and presented them to her for 
inspection.  "All clear?" 
 
"Yeah."
