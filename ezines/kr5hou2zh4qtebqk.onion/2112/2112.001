ArcusNet was created Spring Break, 1995.

The objective was to found a net specifically for  
intelligent and experienced message posters of the 817 area 
code, free of bases dominated by woefully ignorant and 
moronic 14 year-olds unaware of basic spelling, grammar, and 
reality in general - that reality being that they suck. 

Sucking is becoming more socially acceptable these days - 
bad trend.  ArcusNet is a reactionary institution, based 
upon our hopes for the flourishing of the high standards 
we choose to enforce upon ourselves.  

Enough of that.. the facts are, ArcusNet has the best coders 
in Texas, and is currently the Net HQ for two quality text 
groups and a superlative programming group, not to mention 
817's finest in general.  The net has expanded a bit, into 
quality boards in Canada and Illinois, and is actively seeking 
further additions.  A list of our BBSs is at the end of this 
file.
             
Just for the fun of it, since this is a FAQ, let's take some 
questions..

Q: I just started my BBS, and I think ArcusNet would really 
   help it out - I don't have many users yet, but my mother 
   says I'm smart.. can I join?  

A: No.  You need to establish yourself first, which could
   take weeks or months, depending on how good of a SysOp
   you turn out to be.  Get some good users - especially
   good posters.  As far as we're concerned, the message
   bases *are* the BBS.  If you can't generate a 
   respectable 60-100 posts a day in your local bases,
   then you're not strong enough to be joining any nets.
   The network often generates 100k of messages (that's
   zipped text) a day from only six bulletin boards.  
   Build up to it.

   g1gz 0f St0rAG3.. aFfiLz 0uT mY AsS - 1 g3t mY 
   WaR3z fr0m 3uR0p3 - AnD 1 aPPar3ntLy r3c3iv3

   z's AnD r3pLAc1nG o'z w1Th 0'z.. cAn 1 J01N?

A: No.  d00dz suck.  We laugh at people like you.  Ditch 
   your 0-day penis props and do something creative with 
   your pitiful life.  You are a waste of organs.

Q: Hey.  I run a multinode BBS, with several hundred users.  
   I carry 3 international nets and several Internet 
   newsgroups, and I have thousands of cool texts online.  
   I code in ASM, and I look just like David Koresh.  Can I 
   join ArcusNet?

A: You're cooler than we are.  But not by much, because I used 
   to look like David Koresh, too.. maybe you can have 
   probationary status.

Q: If I were to..

A: Yes, because you used the subjunctive mood correctly.  I
   love it when people do that, though they often suck 
   anyway.

Q: You're the ones that suck - who are you to judge us?  
   Why is your definition of quality the only correct one?  

A: Whine, bitch, whine, bitch.. it's simply fact.  BBSland
   has amazing potential for stupidity and erroneous
   self-importance, which is usually realized.  It's
   getting harder to find things of any value not ridden
   with idiotic angst (another fucking stupid trend) or
   suffering from another equally lame mental impairment.  
   Why not separate ourselves from those who are even 
   now crowding into BBSs hoping to be I<-â’D someday?
   
Q: Can you be a little more specific about what goes on in
   your supposedly awesome net?

A: If I told you, your brain might catch fire.  
   Religions, Metaphysics (for the astral projectors), Real 
   Musicians (not hacks who transcribe Nirvana), Literature, 
   Role-Playing Games, blah, blah..  SysOps have their own 
   discussion area, and there is also the matter of Ouais 
   Mec! and [2112], two text file groups based on BBSs in 
   ArcusNet - each has its own support echo, where applicants 
   and members alike post their submissions for consideration 
   and criticism.  We also have ridiculously skilled coders,
   to the point of having two programming bases, one for 
   dabblers and one for the awesome. 
   We do occasionally blacklist posters from the net.  It's 
   not gratuitous or unreasonably prejudiced.  It's simply 
   the best method of preserving the order of the net.
                                  
Q: Is it even possible to join this net, or are you just
   teasing us, O rapist of both furry and slippery animals?

A: Yes, it's possible to join, and we really *want* people to 
   join.  Not just anybody, though, which is what has made it 
   so much more complicated, dammit.
   When asking a Swede working at a hotel pool why he had to
   wear a swim cap, a wise man was told, "You should not
   have to swim through other people's hair."

Q: How do I contact you?

A: Call me at [tnh] (817.346.3370) or send e-mail to
   mcy1536@utarlg.uta.edu.  I'll call your BBS soon after and 
   see where you stand in the great BBS food chain.
