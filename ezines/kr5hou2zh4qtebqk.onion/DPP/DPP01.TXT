 After coming home from school one day, I found myself looking
 at a stack of posts in alt.phreaking as I often do.  The 
 problem I faced today was that I had a bad day and I found 
 myself to be, err, annoyed with a majority of the posts.  I saw
 people telling each other crap, lots of flames and a lot of
 stupid questions.  I know that there is no such thing as a 
 stupid question, but some people don't even try and get the
 answer themselves.
 
 A few hours later I started writing an article for System
 Failure (hi pingiuno@#$!@#!#~!#$%!#@), but decided to start
 my own zine instead.  I had already tried this once and
 knew that it would be hard, because last time, I failed.  I
 sent off a few e-mails to get co-editors.  I got a few to 
 join.  I had some really 'leet articles that I was (one that
 I still am) working on.
 
 So I had found a few people to help me out in a zine.  I
 got some leeto articles, and that's about it.  This is
 where we're at.  Spawned from listening to way too much
 KoRn, chatching monitor rays, and eating Lucky Charms,
 comes DPP.  A zine devoted to the intelligent phreak.  The
 one who doesn't take himself or what others think of himslef
 too seriously.  So here is the inaugeral issue of
 digital phreak p1mps, sit back, relax, and enjoy.

   It is now 1998.  What has it brought us? The death of Sonny Bono,
 the trial of Ted Kazinnski (sp?), and of course the birth of a 
 brand new e-zine, us.  We aren't about being "leet phreax0r
 p1mps", that's just a name, and what's in name anyways?  It really
 doesn't matter that much.  We are here to bring you cool things, 
 that is, if we can.  The only way free e-zines work is article
 submission.  They really cannot work without them, so I 
 encourage you all to please write something and send it to me.
 There is only so much that I can write, I have two articles in
 the making right now, plus I want to be able to still write
 occaisionally for System Failure.  So for the Love of God submit
 something! Anything will do, as long as it deals with the h/p
 scene.  Oh yeah, and as far as I know, Napalmoliv is doing
 the February issue, so send your articles to him.  Sphinx is
 doing the March issue and Dark|||Knight is doing April (that
 doesn't sound right to me, but I don't know why).

 Is it just me or did I use waaaaaay to much of those special 
 characters and "elite" shit?  I know I did it up near the top
 but if you keep reading then you will see that the articles 
 aren't filled with that shit.  Hopefully I managed to get myself
 some 'leet articles.

  The alt.phreaking situation:

   Ahh, good old alt.phreaking.  Well, maybe not good.  It seems to
 me that people just aren't _trying_ to find the answers themselves.
 They come in and ask us where to find certain electrical
 components (ei. redbox crystal.)  They seem to think that the
 best place to get their parts is Radio Shack.  I have seen about 
 30-40 posts with the numbers for both digikey and mouser.  Then
 there are the people who are selling redboxes.  That is just not
 right, plain and simple.  I _don't_ even own a redbox, but I  
 understand how and why they work the way they do.  I understand
 How to make a redbox, of which there are about 5-6 ways I know
 of.  What people have got to remember is that boxing is not
 the only form of phreaking there is.  When it comes to phreaking
 we should try to learn all that we can about _everything_, not
 just one subject, which we see a lot of people doing.  
 
  The AOL situation:
 
   There is no AOL situation, as far as phreaking goes.  Now if
 you goto ANY of the alt.2600 Newsgroups and you use AOL you
 will never get anywhere, in fact no one will even attempt to
 help you, simpily because you use AOL.  This does not happen
 however in alt.phreaking.  Some of the smarter, more intelligent
 phreaks in there use AOl.  One of them, in fact is one of the
 p1mps.  Dr. Maniac and Smokes are prime examples.  They often
 answer questions rather than flame.  I have done some stupid
 things in alt.phreaking, like posting that VMB I hacked.  As
 a bit of advice, I would say not to give out numbers like that.
 I just recently saw this happen with a number smokes gave out,
 now it wants and username and password.  The thing is, we are
 only human, and we all make mistakes.  The diffence between
 the good phreaks and everyone else is that the good phreaks
 will admit it when they make a mistake or that a good phreak
 won't talk about shit that he/she doesn't know about.
 
   Well, Happy new year, and happy phreaking to all.  Don't worry
 about everyone liking you, because it will never happen.  Anyways
 the point of life is to be happy, not to make everyone like you.
 So sit back and Enjoy!
 Just a Randomly peiced together Thought...

 I think (hope) we're all familiar with the LD company OCI.  
 If you don't know what OCI is, they are the stupidist (labeled 
 that way in the best way possible!) phone company, that is to 
 say they are the most harrassed company in the world.  At least 
 by me.  This is just a bunch of me and my friends bothering 
 their operators, and an ocaissonal supervisor. 
 
 If you are still confused and are still having trouble finding your
 own ass with two hands and a flashlight, just like all those mean
 people on IRC said, then you might want to check out the Phone
 Losers of America Super (un)Official OCI site at www.phonelosers.org.
 They are bad mean people too.
 
 You can call an OCI operator by calling either 105550 or
 1800-288-2880.  See, they think that your stupid and will think
 that they are AT&T.  Do this only from a Payphone, as if you didn't
 already know this.  If you decide to bother people from your own
 home then use *67.  Otherwise call some pay-phones up and
 bother whomever picks it up, that can result in hours of fun.
 
 Retarded Disclaimer:

 None of this should be done by anyone.  I am not responsible if
 you *actually* get caught for this.  It should never, ever, ever
 ever, ever, never be done.  It is bad.  If you do, you will die,
 die and goto hell. So don't do it...because it's bad.   If you
 do I don't want to recieve 20 e-mails a day saying "I got caught
 bothering people on my phone because of you!", because I am not 
 responsible for your stupidity. I do not claim to have actually
 done this.

*click!*

Henry: hello, henry how may I help you?
Hatred: How'da dooley doo, eh? I'm talkie toaster, your chirpy
breakfast campanian.  Would anyone like any toast? (recording)
Henry: Hello? This is an OCI operator.
hatred: Well, I want toast!
Henry: Are you playing on the phones?
hatred: damn straight I am!
henry: Thank you for using OCI.

Tips:

o Use call forwarding, and forward your number to say, the person you
  hate the most.

o Be creative.  Do anything that you might find annoying, ect.

o Don't worry about being offinsive.  It makes you more bothersome.

o Use *67, in fact, put it on you speeddial right now.

o Don't worry about being caught, I never have been.

o Only bother PEOPLE from you home phone.  Not the Telco. In fact, 
  don't even think about it.

 Well that's about it.  I have more, just not typed up.  I prolly won't 
 even print them unless there is a 3 or 4th issue (we will most likely 
 have died off before then.)

 Notes:
  Is it just me or do I see a trend with all the numbers asking for
 a 4 digit pin?  I have yet to figure out what one of these things is
 though, maybe once i hack one. :)
  Walter Levy is a mean, bad, mean, lame person.  If your lucky he will
 yell at you.  Say roy sent you and he'll get mad. BTW: he told me it
 was mortuary, so tell them your dead!  He's threated to call the
 police twice now, never has though.  I'll prolly have an entire thing
 full of me bothering him for issue 2-3.

 ---------------- 
 - INTRODUCTION -
 ----------------

 Ever wanted to own and operate your own TV station?  All it takes 
 is a trip to K-Mart/Radio Shack.  Let's Begin.

 -------------
 - MATERIALS -
 -------------

 1 VCR or Camcorder (The source of what you want to air)
 3 Coaxial Cables
 1 Roof VHF Antenna (If you have cable, you'll have to broadcast 
 from someone's house who doesn't)
 2 Signal Amplifiers (Made for people with weak cable signals, cost 
 about $10-25. You can get one at K-Mart/Fleet Farm/Wally World/Radio 
 Shack.  They have two female coaxial connecters, one input and one
 output)

 -------------
 - PROCEDURE -
 -------------

 1. Plug in all the stuff

 2. Take one of the coaxial cables and put one end in the jack on the 
    VCR that says "Video Out" or "Out to TV," or the "Video Out" jack on 
    your camcorder

 3. Take the other end and put it in the input jack on one of the amps
 
 4. Take another of the cables and put it in the output jack of the 
    amp you just put the first cable into

 5. Take the other end of the cable you put into the output jack and put 
    it into the input jack on your other amp
  
 6. Take another coaxial cable and put one end into the output jack on 
    the second amp and stick
    the other end into the coaxilal jack behind your TV that usally is 
    used by your TV to receive signals  
 
 7. Put a tape into your VCR and hit play, or if you're using a camcorder 
    hit record and play reporter
 
 8. Call a friend and see if it works

 -----------
 - DIAGRAM -

|------------|           |-------|       |-------|        |
|    VCR     |===========|  AMP  |=======|  AMP  |========| <------Wall Jack
|------------|           |-------|       |-------|        |

 -----------
 - CLOSING -
 -----------

      Your station should broadcast on channel 3.  Depending on how strong 
 your amps are, everyone in your city will probably be able to get it in, 
 unless you live in a large city. For related info and a nice antenna 
 diagram, check out plans for the Snow Box.  Good Luck.

 Before you read on, I want to warn you.  Power lines on 
 telephone poles usually carry around 13.5KV at varying high 
 amperage.  Before you climb a pole, make sure that the phone 
 lines are on the bottom.  If the lowest set of cables has all 
 of the fancy shcmancy sets of boxes, and varying size cans.
 
 Beige boxing.  Too easy.  All one needs to do is clip into 
 a TNI box.  But wait - what about areas that have the older 
 wiring plots where the only form of a network interface is a 
 cheap screw terminal set with a rubber "Bell System" cover over 
 it?  You know the area.  All of the houses predate 1980. The 
 lines are above ground.  Some of the poles have climbing rungs.  
 One question I heard while teaching a few newbies in my area was 
 "Why are those there any way?  Don't they [bell] have trucks?".  
 Yes, they do, but sometimes its either more convienient for the 
 line to be up close and personal, or there's no cherry picker 
 on the truck they have.  Then there's those green boxes on 
 the pole, or the drop boxes on the line.  Why have the 
 older brothers of cans been forgotten?
 
 What are those things on the line?
 Those "bubble" type objects are called drop boxes, and are 
 like cans, except more cluttered.  The green boxes mentioned 
 earlier are the equivalent of cans.  In fact, they weren't 
 actually used in the construction of the neighborhood, but only 
 in recent line additions or conversions.  The big ugly gray 
 boxes with those wierd metal assemblies under them are usually 
 area pinouts.  The same thing as the big green ones used today, 
 only smaller.

 How do I know which pole to strike?
 Look for ones that either:
 1) Have small green boxes that are about 1 foot tall, 5 inches wide, 
 and 1 inch deep.
 2) Have those wierd sitting assemblies with the large area pinouts.  
 The pinout boxes have double doors, usually closed with a swinging 
 latch, and are mostly the ugly metallic gray.
 
 Stay away from ones that:
 1) Have greenish gray boxes that say "alpha" (I'll explain why later)
 2) Have light poles on them
 3) Are on busy roads
 4) Are loaded up with nails and staples
 5) Have loose wires hanging down
 
 Now that you have chosen a pole, look at it.  When you look 
 at the pole, and notice that the lowest rung is about five 
 or six feet off the ground, you may be wondering how to get 
 up.  Simply answered: While looking at the pole you may 
 have noticed some metal plates attached to the pole with 
 large bolts (or a wooden block, depending on the area).  I don't 
 know the technical name, but in the suburbs of New York City, 
 we call them "kicker posts".  To get up, grab on to the lowest 
 set of rungs, and put your foot on the lowest kicker post.  
 Pull your weight up, grab onto the next rung, and put your other 
 foot on the next kicker post.  Pull up your weight again, and 
 you should have a rung to put your foot on now.  So get your 
 self up the easily climbable semi-ladder, and once you get to 
 the lowest set of cables, STOP, or tomorrow on page 28b of the 
 newspaper there will be a story titled "Local Hoodlum Killed 
 by Light and Power!".
 
 What's one to do while up there?
 If you followed my directions, and brought your beige box, 
 and a line tester, and a flashlight, open up either the box 
 or the pinout, and find a line and beige box it.  Dial an ANAC 
 (18004879240) and find out your number.  _IF_ you happen to 
 find an enemies line, just rip it out.  Hell, they'll (bell 
 employees) probably look in the can, and come back and say 
 "customer's responsibility", even though its obvious that 
 it was maliciously pulled.
 
 What the hell were you talking about before about those boxes 
 with "alpha" on them? Those are load pots.  There function is 
 to amplify the signal on cable pairs.  They usually only exist 
 beyond a two mile radius from the Central Office.  I will  
 stress this once that they _ARE_ high voltage.  One of my 
 friends fathers (a lineman) was nearly killed servicing one.  
 If you noticed the two mile thing, and immediatly ADSL popped 
 into your head, then yes, the correlation is that the load pot 
 _does_ add noise and static pops to the line, and only equipped 
 to efficiently amplify a small range of frequencies.  Yes, it 
 sucks, but thats the way life goes.

 I have a burning questions about this!  Where can I get an 
 answer? You can either post to alt.phreaking or send me an 
 email at either MMX_KiLLa@geocities.com or s12@barrms1.lhric.org

 Now, i know you're saying, "What, is that the best you could 
 come up with?" Well, this is basically a general article on what 
 you can do with your home fone.
 
 But first, i'd like to share with everyone a neet trick i learned.
 
 1. Push Ctrl-Esc (this should open the start menu)
 2. Push Esc (this should close the start menu, but now it's selected)
 3. Push Alt-{dash} (this should open a menu on your start button)
 4. Push Alt-F4 (this should close the start button!)

 (It's great to do to ALL the computers in your school, they'll think 
 they got a virus and get a professional to come in)

 To get it back reset the computer, and if theres no security thingy, 
 just restart explorer.


 Now to the main point of this article. Ok so you've cracked open your 
 ordinary Bell/AT&T/Lucent fone.  Now what?!  Well, you've got the 
 keypad, the reciever, the jack for the wall, the jack for the reciever, 
 and possibly a smaller brown memory board.  What the hell are you sposed 
 to do with this? Well, i've got four ideas.

 1. Create a really cool handy Beige Box
 2. Throw it at your little brother.
 3. Make a Bypass Box

 1. Ok, so what you do is find yourself a cigar box and some quality 
 tape, although i recommend solder.  From there open the cigar box and 
 remove that pesky nail, for now.  Take a long fone wire and strip 
 it down, usually you only need the red and green wires, but you can 
 use allofem if you want.  Cut two holes, on opposite sides a little 
 bigger than either of the two jacks you removed from the fone.  KEEP 
 THE PIECES OF CIGAR BOX YOU CUT OUT.  Pop the jacks into the two holes 
 that you just created.  Solder 'em in good, or tape them. Solder/Tape 
 everything else into the box in a nice corner, so you've got room,
 for whatever you want, like a good collection of l/d numbers, the 
 telefone book's more interesting pages, a screwdriver, and a GIANT wire.  
 With the cut out pieces, tape them over the jacks, so the box is 
 inconspicous.  Put the nail back in and rubberband it shut, with 
 everything inside but the reciever, there...you have everything you
 need to beige, in a nice compact box!
 
 2. Open it up, and seperate all the big parts from the small ones.  
 Go get a fan and some shaving gel.  When he's in his room, not paying 
 attention, hide, and throw all the little pieces at him, 1 by 1.  Put 
 the fan, facing him, turn it on high, quickly spray shaving gel all 
 over it.  When he's cleaning up, chuck the fone at him and watch him 
 cry.  Then apologize, get another fone, and do it to the other brother.
 
 3. Finally, we return to the point.  Betcha never heard of a Bypass Box 
 before.  Well, i hate muted handsets on Bell fones, and there were no 
 box plans, so i made my own.  First off, i hate writing things other 
 people wrote, so find your own redbox plans and, you guessed it, make 
 one!  Follow my plans up above for a cigar-box-beige box.  This time 
 keep all four wires when you strip the fone wire.  Solder your redbox 
 to the top of your reciever, and solder the speaker right next to the 
 mouthpiece.  Now you've got a Bypass "Red" box, or simply a Bypass box. 
 Using it is easy, just tap into the payfone with the beige part of the 
 box, and from there use the red box as you ordinarily would on a non-
 muted fone!  That, is the best way to get around a muted Bell fone. 
 Muted COCOTs you say?  Easier!  Just beige them!  This works for most,
 if it doesnt work 'round where you live, email me, nothingg@yahoo.com
 
 PS  If this box already exists, email me, and i'll give it it's rightful 
 name and list it's creator's handle.  If not, it was created by 
 Nothingg, now don't forget that!

 The reason I put "presented by" instead of "by" is
 because this is not *my* theory.  I heard it on IRC
 from somebody who really doesn't want to have his
 name on anything or be associated with publications.
 I respect that, therefore, I am not printing his
 name in this article.  The person I heard it from
 is probably one of *the* most intelligent and best
 phreak I know.

 It has come to my conclusion that many of us do
 not understand why BlueBoxing doesn't work.  It is
 _not_ because of ESS.  Catch that? NOT because of
 ESS as sooo many of us want to believe.  Blueboxing was
 made possible because siganlling trunks and voice
 trunks were not kept seperate my Ma Bell (silly them!)
 The method of Interoffice signalling that was used was
 SF signalling.  The infamous 2600hz tone was what
 indicated that a trunk was in use.  

 This method was soon replaced by newer methods of 
 signalling, they were Loop Signalling and CCIS.  With
 Loop Signalling the way to indicate that a trunk was
 in use wasn't the 2600hz tone, but rather reversing
 the polarity of the voltage on the trunk.  Now signalling
 trunks and voice trunks are kept separete so we can only
 access the voice trunks, so it's not as easy as just 
 reversing the voltage on the line and siezing the trunk
 because you don't have access to the signalling trunk.
 
 Now if you did have access to the signalling trunk, and if
 you could reverse the polarity, send the new routing 
 information using MF tones... You would've found a new
 way the Blue Box.  The problem is accessing the signalling
 trunk without being physically at the switch.  You would
 HAVE to have access to the signalling trunk to be able
 to do this, it cannot be accessed from the voice trunk, it
 just isn't possible.
 
 Keep in mind though, this is only a theory.  It is not
 proven nor has it been, to the author's knowledge, ever
 been done.  If you have any comments or know anything
 about this please email it to me, so that I might 
 bring it to the attention of the guy who really thought
 of this.

 [Editor's note- I DID NOT COME UP WITH THE THEORY.  Yes,
  I wrote the Article, but only because the guy who's idea
  it was doesn't like writing stuff.  This guy is fuckin' 
  'leet, he just isn't into writing stuff.  Hope you learned
  something.]

 [Editor's note-  I stole this from alt.conspiracy.  I don't
 know exactly who wrote this, except that he appears to be
 crazy.  The only reason I included it was because I found 
 it both amusing and quite insane.  Well, this about wraps it 
 up for humor, now doesn't it?]


     Can we talk plainly? 

      In my view, at least, taking up a strictly defensive 
 posture is a strategy that mainly serves our enemies and the
 powers that be. Almost every day, in fact, the government at 
 the federal and state levels throughout these continental United 
 States are implementing drastic measures to make it nearly 
 impossible for any kind of organized revolt to materialize. 
 
      We all know how the Clinton Administration and their 
 bed-buddies in Congress in both parties practically tripped 
 over each other to add additional restrictions to firearms. 
 They even specified that tagaments be added to ammonium nitrate 
 and other potential "terrorist" reagents.
 But did you know they have passed new regulations which 
 prevent the common person from purchasing sterilizing agents 
 like potassium permanganate? It's true. In order to get even 
 a small quantity of those purple-colored crystals, you must 
 have a special PERMIT or a special DEALER'S LICENSE. I'm not 
 kidding. But the list does not stop there. 
    
     In short, nearly anything that can be made into an explosive
 concoction, even if it would require sophisticated equipment 
 and know-how, has been arbitrarily banned. Yes, you can still 
 get some things in minute amounts, but not unless you are QUALIFIED 
 first. Good luck!

      Meanwhile, the weasels in our government are working 
 feverishly to perfect many high-tech devices. They have sensitive 
 equipment which enables them to detect a handgun in a passing car, 
 or in the pocket of a single person standing in a huge crowd. They 
 have satellites which can photograph two mosquitoes mating, and 
 listening devices which can capture the sound of a mouse tip-toeing 
 across your kitchen floor from several hundred yards away.
 
      What's more, they have smart bombs which can seek out and 
 destroy an enemy who is supposedly fortified at depths of over 
 500 feet. They also have a huge array of chemical and biological 
 brews which will penetrate any protective mask or suit, including a 
 shielded bunker. They've even deployed specially designed and equipped 
 robots which are armed with more than just miniature cameras 
 and listening devices. Some, in fact, are made to kill, especially 
 poorly defended and outmatched civilians. The list goes on and
 on.

      And why is this important? Because we are running out of 
 time. In other words, if we do not hurry up and get our act 
 together soon, the government will be able to stop even those 
 they are slightly suspicious about before they're able to realize 
 what's going down. They can already BLOCK virtually all radio 
 transmissions in this hemisphere. They can crawl in and out of any 
 computer that transmits or receives bytes of information over the 
 telephone lines. They can decode encryption patterns faster than 
 new ones can be created. And they have been compiling a list of 
 potential "subversives" and militia-types for the last 10 years. 

     They can freeze your bank accounts. They can order the IRS 
 to go after you. They can seize your property without probable 
 cause. They can even have you murdered under some false pretext 
 like they had arranged at WACO and RUBY RIDGE. They don't care 
 if women and children are involved.
 
      Have you ever written a Letter to the Editor with a political 
 bent and had it published? Then you are marked. Have you ever 
 written an irate letter to a Congressmen or Senator? Then you are 
 marked. Have you ever joined a political organization such as the 
 U.S. Taxpayer's Party, the John Birch Society, or the National 
 Alliance, etc.? Then you are marked. And have you ever belonged 
 to a gun club, the NRA, or a recognized militia? Right.You are 
 doubly marked.
 
      With so much power in the hands of today's authoritarians, 
 it would be suicide to allow them the time they need to become 
 even stronger. Besides, do you really believe that a corrupt system 
 will repair itself by way of the ballot box? Keep dreaming. That is 
 exactly what the socialists and the neo-Marxists are banking on.
      
      To tell you the truth, I think that most people will OBEY this
 government regardless of how defiled it becomes. If that's not true,
 then why are we in this mess now?
      Do we not still have income taxes? Are the courts subverting 
 the Constitution? Have people lost their property without just 
 compensation because of zealous environmental decrees? Are 
 regulations becoming more expensive and cumbersome on the average 
 ma and pa business? Is the government teaching our children 
 multiculturalism and doing what it can to destroy the family? Is 
 homosexuality on the rise? Do thousands die each day in abortion  
 mills? Are the Ten Commandments forbidden to be displayed in 
 courthouses? Are there more children and teenagers experimenting 
 with illegal drugs? Is the national media overwhelming biased 
 against conservatives, especially Fundamental Christians? And are 
 people generally more interested in sports, than they are when it  
 concerns what their elected officials are up to? Yes to all of 
 the above. 
      Need I say more? 
 
      Then stop talking and start doing. The longer you wait, the more
 costly it will be.

    This was written by myself in order to express my feelings
 about people that everyone has to deal with at one time or
 another.  People who are not right, not necessarily by their
 fault, but nevertheless are messed up in their feeble minds.
 My primary goal is not to put these weaklings of society
 down, but to establish the roots of this problem
 and help the sick, twisted individuals eventually get help for
 their disease.

 Some people are really fucked up.  I don't mean that they're
 serial killers, or that they go around beating other people
 to a pulp for the hell of it, but that they are just messed
 up for life.  I know people like this, and every time I meet
 another I think I'm in hell or being punished for something
 I didn't really do.  They are the kind of people that you
 probably think are normal citizens, carrying on day to day
 because they must.  To the outside world, they seem like your
 everyday Joe, but their friends and family know what's really
 up.  These people are driven by some unknown force to annoy,
 piss off, and just plain drive others to the brink of insanity.
 These are the people who push serial killers to do what they
 do, and who push people to take others hostage in day care
 centers <cough cough>.  These are not your typical assholes,
 these people are worse and something needs to be done.

 I haven't done medical research, but I don't think
 that personalities like these are derived from the gene pool.
 Maybe the stars or heavens, but what I am really considering
 at the moment is childhood.  Psychologists (is that spelled right?)
 will tell you that most attitudes and personalities are derived
 starting from childhood.  What pushed these individuals to become
 so deranged during their childhood?  Was is edgy, abusive parents?
 Was it situations where they never had power and now the can't get
 enough? I don't know the answers but hopefully I can determine more
 precisely where these problems start because these people are
 making me and the rest of the world angry.  Something must be done,
 those reading this must take action and e-mail me with a note.  Tell
 me how you liked this.  Latah :)

 It has occured to me that many people don't understand
 the operation of a Bell payphone.  I see in alt.phreaking
 people telling each other blatant crap.  I saw one post
 that said that the linemen had to go and reset the actual
 payphone itself to ask for 35¢.  This is not true.
 The only reason a payphone is a payphone is because it is
 labeled in the switch as being one.  Not because it is
 a phone that asks for money that is hooked up to a 
 regular loop line.  That would be a COCOT, a Customer
 Owned Coin Operated Telephone, and it would not be owned
 by the telco.  

 Now I want you to go do an experiment.  Go out and find
 a payphone with the wires easily accessable or out in
 open view.  Strip them a bit, and tap in with your 
 biege box.  Try and dial out, and what does it do? It 
 tells you to deposit money doesn't it?  Ahhh, wait one 
 minute! How did YOUR phone become a Payphone?  Well as
 you can guess it didn't.  It's because your on a loop that
 has been flagged as being one for a payphone in the 
 switch database (the RCMAC code for this is DTF).  Get it? 

 Okay with me so far?  Okay, so we have one (1) virtually
 armoured phone with a coin slot hooked up to (1) telephone
 loop that wants money.  So how does the phone tell the line
 that you put money in?  The very same reason a redbox works.
 
 When you deposit money, it makes little beeps, just listen.
 These beeps are referred to as ACTS tones.  These tones are
 a combination of 2200 hz + 1700 hz.  What a redbox does is 
 digitally re-produce these tones.  The telephone listens for 
 these tones, and when the PAYPHONE hears them, it sends the
 tone down to the switch for every coin you put in. So, in 
 effect,  if you can reproduce the tones, then you can trick 
 the phone into thinking that you deposited $3.25 for that 
 call out to Colorado.

 And when the telco. decides to change (raise) the price of
 a local call from a payphone, all they have to do is tell 
 the computer to demand more of your hard earned cash.  They
 can change the price on any single phone they want, such as
 one in an airport to keep up with prices.  If they wanted to
 they could have one phone demand $1 for a local call and then
 the one down the hall only want a quarter.  It's all in the
 computer, not the phone like everyone wants to think.  If it
 were the phone then lots of poor linemen would have to run
 around to change prices on a lot of payphones every time
 Bell wanted to up the price again, and that would cost
 them a lot of money.  

 So, be happy that you know _why_ a redbox works now and why
 all those nice armoured phones on the walls everywhere act
 the way they do.  Plans and insrtructions for a redbox are
 all over the internet, so leave alt.phreaking alone.

 We're not very organized.  I did setup #p1mp on FEFnet, but i hardly
 ever go there.  I usually hang in #peng on EFnet along with sphinx.
 I dunno about the other peeps tho.  E-mail them and ask.  Our addies
 are on the DPP site and up in the top thinggie.  
 There is a monthly p1mp meeting on the 30th of every month at
 4:00 Central, and  if there is no 30th then it's the 29th in #p1mp.  
 So feel free to  come and listen in.  Be warned though, it will be 
 moderated by me, so it doesn't get out of control (you have to ask 
 for voice if you need to say something).  Anyways, I'll post a log 
 of the meeting on the DPP website. Until next month!...
