    Introduction....

         So. Welcome to Digital Phreak P1mps issue number two. As you may
    as well know, it's late. Four days late, to be precise. Why? Well, so
    happens, there's this thing called WORK. It gets in the way from time
    to time. There's this other thing called HIGH-SCHOOL. Yes, you may
    have heard of these things. One provides a person with income, while
    the other provides you with a bunch of textbooks and a whole lot of
    styrofoam ceiling tiles. Or maybe they both do. It all depends.

        And what does all this mean? Well, it means that I took my sweet
    fucking time putting this shit together. And it's barely even telecom-
    related this time! But it's still cool! Or not. I don't know, decide
    for yourself. Whatever. Enjoy.

            Your Editor and Employee of the month, Wal-Mart #1184,

Hook and Hole...a cool vending machine rip
by hobKnob (behoth@hotmail.com)

Ok...so ya want a snickers bar? fuck that.
Ok...so ya want 10 snickers, 5 bags o' chips, some life savers a couple
snackie cakes, some cheesy poofs, and a over priced bag of flaming hot
peanuts? Read on.

I know what yer thinkin.. "hey, paw, lets you and me go rustle up the
shotguns, and rob us a 7-11!"

Well... not that I have any problems with that...I suppose it kinda
lacks the subtlety of smashing into a coke machine with yer truck..

Off topic again...back to subject.

I have never seen a text on this before. In fact, I have never heard of 
anybody besides me and a few friends doing it... It's what I have labled 
the "Hook and Hole" method.

What you need: 

#1      1 coat hanger
#2      1 hand drill (use a manual one, as they don't make any noticable
           noise.. i also reccomend the Fiskers one, as it'll fit in j00 
           pocket)
#3      a loot bag. (I have a nice Milwaukee Journal/Setinal newspaper
           bag bright fuckin yellow)
#4      a candy vending machine 

Now...when nobody is around...or paying attention...go up to the machine
and drill a hole in the plexiglass some place where it won't be noticed.
Make sure you use a small drill bit... One barely bigger than the diameter
of your coat hanger. (What we did was actually drill 4 holes in the glass,
one in each corner about 1' from the corners. You'll see why later on.)
Now go back to what ever it was you were doing...
Come back later with your coat hanger and your loot bag.  

Straighten out the coat hanger and make bend in one end of it,
like so:

-------------------------/
                        /
                       
Insert the hook end through the "hole" and use it like a "hook"
to snag shit from the spiral holders. Just keep pulling the items out and
droppping it into the receptical... Have a friend stuff it into the
bag to speed it up.

Pretty simple eh?

-options-

if you're just lookin for a fee treat everyonce in a while.. drill a
hole
near the group of food stuffs you will be after.. and go to a hardware
store and lift one of those small claw things.. they look like this.

| |          /
|o|oooooooooo--
| |          \ 

open

|   |
|ooo|oooooooooo0
|   |

closed

The outer diameter of the "barrel" is about .25 inches, 
and the whole thing is about 18 inches long. It's also quite 
flexible, as the barrel and such has a spring for the housing.
Simply reach in...snag what you want...drop it...and your're set-
a free snack whenever you want!

-Note-
I suggest drilling 4 or 5 holes in the plexiglass.. one in each corner,
(6-12" from the edges) and one dead in the center of the glass... 
Not only does it look like ventalation holes, but it lets you get at
everything in the machine with little difficulty!

Once you got your bag o loot you can do almost anyting with it.. 
sell it for prophet...eat it...or just give it away (yeah right).

Novell Netware Exploits- How to use them to your advantage
by Evil_Gremlin (evil_gremlin@hotmail.com)

     Let's face it.  Most people who own computers are idiots.  To 
compensate for this lack of knowledge, software developers make their 
software more "user-friendly" and easy to use.  And the more software is easy
to use, the easier it is to exploit.  Novell Netware is known for being an 
easy-to-use platform that is very secure.  I hope to show you that, like 
every good program, it has its flaws.  These flaws, if abused correctly, can 
open up security gaps wide enough for Sally Struthers to slide through.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
			   O  v  e  r  V  i  e  w

 1.)  	Why Novell Netware?
 2.)	The Basics 
 3.)	Accessing Accounts
 4.)	Account Passwords


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
		     W h y   N o v e l l   N e t w a r e ?

	Novell Netware, owning 60% of the market share, is the most common 
platform despite the tireless efforts of both Windows NT and UNIX systems.  
Its extremely fast and reliable File\Print services are major strengths that 
these systems are just now attaining.  Netware systems are used because of 
their easy-to-use but powerful environments which can tailor to the needs of 
both system managers and copy-boys.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
			    T h e   B a s i c s

	The success of almost everything in this document depends on the way 
that the network is set up.  Not everything will work.  In most cases, you 
will need to know the version of Novell Netware that you are using.  If you 
don't know it, try running VERSION in the SYS:PUBLIC directory.  You need 
some basic knowledge on how a computer operates.  Now, I know that very few, 
if any of you are professional hackers.  You wouldn't be reading this if you 
were.  This isn't the most complete Novell Netware article.  I left out some 
details that weren't practical either because they could only be used under 
very slim circumstances or because they don't accomplish enough.  This 
document is centered around the intermediate or beginner hacker.  Most of the
programs described in this document come with Netware.  Any programs that 
don't will be listed on the last page along with where to find them.  I guess
what I am saying is to sit back and relax.
	In Netware, there are common levels of security that are offered to 
certain users.  The security levels and your what you can execute within them
are listed below:
	
	(1) Not Logged In - 	Very basic commands, usually programs in the 
				SYS:LOGIN directory
	(2) Logged In     -	Basic commands and programs controlled by
 				trustee rights
	(3) Operator	  -	Basic access, control of print queues, a few 
				special commands such as FCONSOLE
	(4) Supervisor    -	Full file system access, control of user 
				access, server configurations, and security
	(5) OS Access	  -	Console access, all NLMs and most commands
				typed at the console run at this level, 
				partial file access, optional supervisor
				access
	Now, onto accessing the server.  When logging in directly (a 
physical console), versions 3.x and 4.x take two very secure measures.  They
both use packet signiture and password encryption techniques.  But, to log 
into the server from a remote location using RCONSOLE (Remote Console), all 
thats required is a single password.  This is designed so that administrators
can execute commands as if they are actually at the server console.  RCONSOLE
establishes a session with the server.  This is the one major weakness of 
Novell Netware's security.  Now, some of the techniques described in this 
document won't work on 4.x versions.  This isn't a problem, however, because 
almost everybody still has 3.x versions.  Those who do have 4.x versions 
usually still have one or more 3.x servers still being used.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
		    A c c e s s i n g   A c c o u n t s

	As stated in the introduction, people are stupid.  When Novell 
Netware is installed, the platform creates a list of default accounts that 
are used for a variety of different things.  These accounts are can be used 
as a user name and, without entering a password, provide you with access to 
the server.  Keep in mind, however, that smart administrators will have 
disabled these accounts.  The following is a list of these common accounts 
and what Netware uses them for.

	--------------------------------------------------------------------
	SUPERVISOR	-	Default supervisor-equivilant account
	GUEST		-	Default account for non-clients to use
	ADMIN		-	Version 4.x uses it as a default 	
				account with administrator eqivilance
	USER_TEMPLATE	-	Version 4.x uses it as a default account for
 				testing security or client capabilities
	LASERWRITER	-	Printing to a second server
	LASER		-	Printing to a second server
	HPLASER		-	Printing to a second server
	PRINTER		-	Printing to a second server
	PRINT		-	Printing to a second server
	POST            -	Using a second server for e-mail
	MAIL            -	Using a second server for e-mail
	GATEWAY         -	Connecting the server to a gateway machine
	GATE	        -	Connecting the server to a gateway machine
	ROUTER          -	Connecting the server to an e-mail router
	BACKUP          -	Used to make tape backups of the server
	WANGTEK         -	Used to make tape backups of the server
	FAX             -	Connecting the server to a dedicated fax unit
	FAXUSER         -	Connecting the server to a dedicated fax unit
	FAXWORKS        -	Connecting the server to a dedicated fax unit
	TEST            -	Temporary account usage
	ARCHIVIST       -	Default account for Palidrome
	WINDOWS_PASSTHRU-	Supposably needed for sharing resources 			
				without a password
	ROOT            -	Default account for Shiva LanRovers that 			
				allows for ADMINGUI command-line equivilance
	CHEY_ARCHSVR    -	Default backup account for Arcserve
			-	Password WONDERLAND may be required 
	ALT-255				-	Less common but works	
	NOT_LOGGED_IN			-	Less common but works
	PC-CLAS_LOGIN_DO_NOT_REMOVE	-	Less common but works
	--------------------------------------------------------------------	
	
	Now don't shoot yourself if none of these worked.  There are other 
ways to access accounts.  If you want to access existing client accounts, 
try going to the SYS:PUBLIC directory and running SYSCON.  Go into User 
Information and you will be able to view all defined accounts and their 
user's full name.  If this didn't work, try doing the same thing by running 
USERLST.  
	If you are using version 4.1, you can use CX to get accounts.  
When 4.1 is installed, the SYS:PUBLIC directory is added to the Root as a 
Trustee.  This means that the SYS:PUBLIC sirectory has browse access to the 
entire tree.  To utilize this, load all of the VLMs and run CX /T /A /R.  You
won't even have to log in and will be given a list of almost every account on
the server.
	Many accounts will use its user name as its password.  This happens 
when people act like idiots or when accounts are created for users that 
aren't currently using them.  These accounts can be view by using CHKNULL.  
CHKNULL will only work if Bindery Emulation is on.
	If none of the above methods have worked, don't bother guessing 
accounts and passwords.  Netware will ask you for a password whether the 
user name you entered was valid or not.  This can lead to disaster if 
Inturder Detection is turned on.  But, if you have a burning desire to do so,
use ATTACH to log in instead of LOGIN.  At least, with ATTACH, you won't be 
asked for a password if the user name wasn't valid.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
		    A c c o u n t   P a s s w o r d ' s

	If you've got an account, you're probably wondering how to get that 
account's password.  The files that store the passwords in Novell Netware 
are located in different places in different versions.  In versions 2.x and 
3.x, every object and its properties are kept in bindery files.  In 4.x, 
they are stored in an NDS database.  Accounts are bindery objects and their 
passwords and user names are properties.  The following shows where the files 
are located for each version, the file names, and what attributes, or flags, 
that they have.  To access these files, run the Norton Disk Editor with a /M 
parameter.  Then, press F2 to view everything in hexadecimal format.  Next, 
press Ctrl-S to load the search routine.  Enter the file name you're looking 
for and you're done.
	
	VERSIONS	LOCATIONS	FILE NAMES		ATTRIBUTES
       ----------      -----------     ------------  	       ------------
	2.x		SYS:SYSTEM	NET$BVAL.SYS		Hidden System
					NET$BIND.SYS		Hidden System
	3.x		SYS:SYSTEM	NET$VAL.SYS		Hidden System	
					NET$OBJ.SYS		Hidden System
					NET$PROP.SYS		Hidden System
       --------------------------------------------------------------------
	4.x		In versions 4.x, the password files aren't as easily
 			accessible.  They can only be viewed through RCONSOLE
 			using the Scan Directory option.  They will then be 
			stored in SYS:_NETWARE and are as follows:

		VALUE.NDS               NDS Subpart
		BLOCK.NDS               NDS Subpart
		ENTRY.NDS               NDS Subpart
		PARTITIO.NDS            NDS Partition
		MLS.000                 License		
		VALLINCEN.DAT           License Validation

TO BE CONTINUED IN THE FUTURE....(parts 5-8)

The Mack-Daddy Log
by Napalmoliv (napalmoliv@yahoo.com)

     It all started one rainy day in November...GTE had recently installed
two shiny new payphones in my high school...one right next to the cafeteria.
So, as usual, me n' Evil_Gremlin had nothing better to do...so I called up
an ANAC, got the payphone's number (GTE's leaving them off these days?!),
and whipped out my cell phone....

(No offense to all you P.C. white suburban gangsters.)

Girl: Hello?
Napalmoliv: YO! Whad up in the muthafuckin' hey-ouse?
G: What? Who is this?
N: Dis-is tha Mack Daddy, who-my talkin' to?
G: Um, this is a payphone, um...
N: I don' care, I's lookin fo' sum weed!
G: Some what?
N: Weed, muthafucka, you heard me!
G: But, but this is a payphone in a school!
N: Hey, y'all know Tyrone?
G: Um, no. Who are you looking for?
N: I SAID I'm lookin' for some action!
G: But this is a high school!
N: I know, bitch, I like 'em young!
G: (hands phone to friend)
Other Girl: Hello?
N: Hey, muthafucka, whad up?
OG: Um, I dunno?
N: What the fuck? Where's Ty-rone at?
OG: Um, like my friend said, we don't know Ty-
N: Look, I can't be playin' games! I need ta' buy me some weed!
OG: Um, I don't think I can help you...
N: Bullshit! Where's Tyrone at?
OG: Look, I don't know who you're...
N: Fuck this, I gots me a schedule!

How to get the password to your school's internet account
by Neptuium Overkill (quixilver@mailexcite.com)


WARNING:  Do not attempt this during a technology class because a few of those
teachers know what they're doing...so try it in another teacher's room with a
computer.  Also do not attempt this if your school has a program called
WinShield.....it will not let you run a program that is not on the start menu. 

INTRO: Getting your school's internet password is a very simple procedure which
can be easily done by anyone who can run a program.  It is probably considered
an imature lamer activity by "L33T" people, but hell, why pay for internet
access when you can use your school's account at home for free?

PROCEDURE:  Download a Windows Keystroke Logger at
http://www.amecisco.com/ik97v12s.exe.  Copy it to a disk and bring it with you
to school.  OK, now go up to your teacher and ask if you can use the internet 
for a science project or something.  Slide in your disk and execute the keystroke
logger.  Set it so it runs in background mode (So you can't see it on the
taskbar or when you hit CTRL+ALT+DEL).  The above program has this feature and
is the best keystroke logger that I have found, so use it, foo.  OK, now open
the Windows 95 dialer.  If there is a password typed in with Save Password
checked,  uncheck it and delete what's in the password field.  If there is no
password in the password field, you're set.  OK, now get your teacher and say
that there is no password typed in.  They will say OK and come to the computer
and type it in.  They will hit connect and leave the computer.  Wait until they 
are not looking, then spring open the keystroke logger and viola! the school's
internet password for you to do whatever you want with it.  Have Phun!

Exchanging y0 Broken Tone Dialer
by Napalmoliv (napalmoliv@yahoo.com)

     In my various electronic tinkerings, I have destroyed not one, but two
Radio Shack 33 number memory tone dialers. Why? because they're cheap, flimsy
pieces of dog shit that somehow sell for $25. Well, suppose you break the
switches... or you drop it down the stairs...or you try to install the
"redbox" crystal with an electric meat carver. At any rate, your tone dialer
still LOOKS perfect on the outside, but is a big pile of solder and silicon
on the inside. What to do? Collect aluminum cans? Maybe. Sell your spare
tire? Sure. But the fact remains- you just lost $25. SO, to help rectify
the situation, you will EXCHANGE it for a new one, or better yet get $25.00
cash back.

     First off, when you first buy the thing, don't give 'em your real
name/address, in case they catch on later.

     The first tricky part is keeping the tone dialer perfect. No scratches
or stripped screws. Put everything back inside the casing, all nice and neat.
The next thing you'll need is your reciept. It also must be less than 30
days old! Otherwise, you're screwed.

     From here on out, it's just like the old modem scam. But there's two
routes you may take:

A. To get another dialer, simply tell the Radio Shack clerk that it "doesn't
work". Chances are, they won't open it up, they'll just give you a new
reciept and a new dialer. This is the safer of the two options. Radio
Shack's policy does NOT allow a customer to get a refund if merchandise
is defective- only an exchange for a similar item.

B. To get your money back, you must tell them that you changed your mind.
However, the Sales-Dork will now carefully inspect your cannibalized dialer
to make sure that it appears to be saleable. They might try it out with
batteries- when they find that it doesn't work, simply tell them, 
"I never even opened the package" and say stuff like 
"wow, I'm glad I returned it!"

Good luck, and please try to be more careful next time!!

Free Long Distance for Your SOUL!
by Mars (mars@frontiernet.net)

I was bored today so I decided to prank someone.  I looked up a random
name, Mary Groweski (something like that).  This is a transcript of one
of the funniest pranks I've made (I was also pissed at AT&T).  Enjoy!

Mary: Hello?
Me: Hi, this is Matt, from AT&T
Mary: Yes?
Me: We have a new long distance plan, and we think you would be VERY
interested
Mary: What is it?
Me: AT&T will give you 5 years of free long distance calls!
Mary: Really? Why?
Me: Because you are a VALUED costumer
Mary: That's all?
Me: Yup, well, that and we want your soul
Mary: Excuse me?
Me: We'll just send you a little contract, sign on the dotted line,
and...
Mary: Contract? For what?
Me: Your Soul
Mary: My soul?!?
Me: Yes, 5 years of free long distance calls for your little old soul!!!
Mary: Ummm, Ahhhh, I'm sorry, I can't
Me: but WE WANT YOUR SOUL!! AT&T NEEDS SOULS TO LIVE! MWA-HA-HA-HA!
Mary: No, No, No!
<Mary hangs up>  

Damn, it was funny.

My Experiences with RCMAC
by: Hatredonalog (hatredonalog@hotmail.com)

I've only had a few experiences with rcmac.  They were
not pleasant ones either.  I am going to tell you a few
pointers and tips and things they say, general inform-
ation. I will not tell you, however, _how_ to access 
rcmac.  If I give it out, it will porbably be shut-down
and non of us want that now do we?  So no number for 
all you little kiddies out there, I got it, so why can't
you?

  A brief Explanation of What RCMAC is:

RCMAC stands for Recent Change Memory Administrative
Center.  From this you can add special services like
Three-Way calling, CallerID, and such.  You can also
Put trouble flags on people's lines and they won't
be able to use their phone service.
RCMAC is one great big thing.  It's not just local,
or something like that. You can do stuff to people
in other states if your smooth enough.  The only
exception is where GTE is the RBOC.  They use the
Mark System, and I don't know much about this, so
therefore I won't get into it.  Well, anyways its
a big Switch database and it is very powerful.  It
resides under the SOPC (Service Order Provisioning
Center) along with LAC and NAC.


  On with the article you say?...

The first time I called rcmac they were not nice. I
somehow get the feeling that Ameritech hires the
meanest operators for this job, but it's probably
just them trying to keep us from playing with it.

First off, you will probably not get anywhere from
calling rcmac.  You will need a work order to do
anything.  If you can get around that (easy enough, just
tell them that you left it in your truck) then your
in another pickle.  They are going to ask you for your
name and employee number (get these trashing) and then
for your mobile phone number to confirm it.  Even if
you do have they're mobile number (which I do) your
shit out of luck.  This is because if you give it to
them, and they call the lineman you are impersonating,
he's gonna say "What? Hell no I didn't want DTF put on
920-830-6624!"

Now I imagine that this can be avoided by giving them 
the number of the payphone next to you or your own
cell (sounds dangerous though.)

If you bullshit them enough, they will either get the
MA on the line and have security trace the call, at 
which point you will never get anywhere.  They will
probably be on the watch for supisious calls for a 
while, but that's probably just paranoia on my part.

On one occaison they asked me who my supervisor was, 
and I pronounced it wrong, and they got all bitchy
again.  So, before you call know your shit.  know it.


One thing you can do (I got this from a file by Brain-
phreak, so it's not original unforunately) is tell them
you so-and-so at another rcmac, in my case the eau claire
rcmac.  It'll go something like this, hopefully:

rcmac- hello, this is so and so, how may i help you?
phreak- hello, this is the eau claire rcmac and our
        computers are down.  my supervisor told me to
        place a trouble ticket on <line number here>.
        Can you do that for me?
(if they aren't doing dialtones, you should be set.)
rcmac- yes i can.
phreak- thank you.
*click*

Dialtones is when they check to see if there is a
dialtone on your line or not.  If your up at like
3 AM on a conf and you hear clicks for no appearant
reason it's prolly that.  otherwise it's some little
punk tapping into your line.  

If you do succeed in getting rcmac to do something
for you... you might want to know Lineclass codes.

Heres A small list of Lineclass codes:
ESF=speed calling
CWT=Call Waiting CFB=Call Forwarding Busy
CFV=Call Forwarding
TWC=Three Way Calling
TTC=Touch Tone Dialing (fun to remove)
UNA=No Long Distance
PXX=Block All Long Distance services
CHD=Centrex
CPU=" "
ACB=Auto Call Back
FRE=Free Calling
DTF=Payfone
CFD=Coinless Charge a call

Line Problems:

NDT=No DialTone
CC=Cant Call
DTWD=DialTone While Dialing
CH=Cant Hear
CBH=Cant Be Heard


Well, have phun! Until next article...

Editorial: "Destructo-Rant"
by Napalmoliv

     So I'm sitting around, browsing through alt.phreaking. All the time,
pretty much every other day- there's some idiotic post about destryoing
"Ma Bell". Well, I've got some opinions about that.

     Phreaking is NOT destroying the phone system. Phreaking is about learning
it, using it, loving it. Get it right. Going out and stealing a payphone does 
not make you a "phreak" either. Stealing the payphone, learning every detail
of how it operates and having a greater UNDERSTANDING of the phone system
might. (note the use of the word MIGHT, rather than WILL.)

Learn from the old, build the new...

     Blueboxing, redboxing, most (all) other forms of "boxing" and phreaking 
were NOT developed  by driving around with a bunch of fuck-up stoners on
saturday night, dumping acid on payphones or other stupid vandalism shit. So
cut it out. Ripping the handset off that phone? Stop. Think. You = Stupid.

    I walk up to the payphone. Everything's intact. It's not busy. It's off
the beaten path. No drug dealers. No stoners. Cool. Maybe I'll learn
something cool tonight.

Napalmoliv, Signing off...
