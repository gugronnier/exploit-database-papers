	Since this is the first issue of this publication the majority of the
newsletter was dedicated to letting you know who we are. This is the actual
recent news section, wich is a similar to what you will be seeing in future
publications.



-- NAP/PA

     Well, the second edition of the NAP/PA Net News is out, and it looks
like there are alot of changes, mostly for the better. On a bad note, Phoebus
Apollo, the sysop of The infamous Gates of Dawn, [NAPPA Node 1], is in the
process of moving to california. He plans to continue BBSing, and plans to
be active in NAP/PA, but will not be putting GtD back up. Mr. Sike will be
putting up The Gates of Dawn II in its place, but at this time it is not up.

-- TCW

     The Celestial Woodlands is back after a brief rest from modemland,
if you dont already have the number, its definitly worth getting, I think
you can do that on your own though.

                                            -- MS:07/13/89

-- API

     Well, that's it for this issue.  We dont have much news, because we
weren't originally thinking of putting news in the first release, but
this stuff came up and so we did.  Watch for the next issue, it should have
alot more news.

                                           -- LG:07/17/89
