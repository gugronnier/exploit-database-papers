==============================================================================
                               The Status Line
==============================================================================
 
         Well, to begin this off. This part of the newsletter is about new and
upcoming games from the Infocom staff. This edition is latest edition of the
newsletter Infocom has put out. Let's get on with it.
 


     James Clavell's Shogun comes alive
    ------------------------------------
 
      First, there's the sick, mutinous crew to deal with. Then there's your
own exhaustion and illness. Plus, the stormy sea and the treacherous reef to
navigate. But all that pales in comparison to the challenge of surviving your
abrupt entrance into a culture totally foreign to you. Your training has
prepared you for everything.. everything but this.
      Dave Lebling has taken the adventure, intrigue, and excitement of James
Clavell's classic novel, Shogun, one step further in a masterful new work of
interactive fiction. The 7 million Shogun fans who enjoyed his book can now
enjoy the game. They can now explore the fuedal world of Japan, its labyrinthe
palaces, rank jails, serene teahouses, and equally fascinating and complicated
inhabitants.
      The adventure begins on the Erasmus, the only ship of five to survive a
dangerous journey through the uncharted seas. At last on the unknown shores of
The Japans, you face a barbarian's welcome of torture and imprisonment. To
keep your life, you must identify who can hurt you and who can help you. At
first, you know very little about the world in which you find yourself.
Exploring, asking, learning, and testing are all crucial to your survival.
Death is always the merest whisper away.
      In James Clavell's Shogun, you will meet Toranaga and Ishido, vicious
enemies who take the lives of thousands of men in their struggle for the
coveted title of Shogun. You also meet and fall in love with Mariko. Your
translator and initiator into undreamt-of mysteries.
      The key to success in the interactive Shogun is the ability to act as
the British pilot-major Blackthorne would. Handsome, cagey and self-assured,
his confidence is matched only by his ability to navigate a ship through the
trickiest waters. To survive and succeed in this new world requires  thorough
observation, quick thought, and careful action. Lebling's puzzles should be
attacked in Blackthorne's character, and they rely on Blackthorne's personal
knowledge to be solved.
      James Clavell's Shogun ushers in a new era of interactive text
adventures. Immersing you in the world of the game. Shogun, sets the scene
with richly detailed graphix drawn in the style of 16th- century Japaneese
court paintings. It is one of the first games to use our newest parser(later
on in this newsletter), which makes communicating with the game even easier.
Written in the novel's rich , descriptive prose, the game is as engaging as
James Clavell's original. James Clavell himself feels the tone of his work has
been so well captured, that he claims Dave Lebling is "the person who knows
the most about Shogun in the entire world."
       Shogun is now available for the Macintosh, Amiga and Apple II series.
A version for IBM and 100% compatibles will be available in May. Apple II
version retails for $49.95: all other versions retail for $59.95.
 
 


                  Journey: Enter a new realm of storytelling
 
         A great evil has fallen over the land. Your town, suffering from five
years of blighted crops, sickness and contaminated water, begins to lose all
hope. It is then that a small group sets forth in search of help.
         These words send you on your Journey. Subtitled The Quest Begins,
this classic narrative, in the exciting tradition of J.R.R. Tolkien, plunges
you into an uncharted world of dwarves,elves, nymphs and wizards.
         Journey- the first in our new Role-Play chronicles series- takes you
through a world ruled by magic and inhabited by  mythical creatures you may
befriend or battle. And, because you control the actions of the party, you
must be physician, magician, combat-strategist, and character judge while
pursuing the defeat of the evil which has infested the land.
         The party sets out from your home town of Lendros. You may leave your
town for the first time and are astonished by the legendary wonders you
encounter in your adventure. Your quest leads over mountains, through
underground caves, across the plains and over the sea. Clashes with the forces
of evil fought with unexpected allies, and you must decide who are friends and
who are messengers of the Dread Lord.
         Journey breaks into an exciting new genre of computer games that
draws from the best features of interactive fiction, role-playing games and
traditional fiction to create a game with rich prose, challenging puzzles, and
a diverse group of characters. Over 100 beautifully rendered graphic images
add tone and depth to the tale(too bad I can't show you{hehe} it is pretty
good though on a serious note)
         Journey departs from other games in its formats as well. You interact
with the story through menus which provide individual and group options. That
means you spend more time enjoying the story and less time trying to figure
out where you can go and what you can (or can't) do. With the new menu
interface you don't need to be a typist to play. Simply hit the first letter
of the option you desire or use the arrow keys, and voila, you're on your way.
Or, should you prefer, you can use a mouse or a joystick. This simplicity lets
you get into the story quickly. If you're a seasoned player, you'll love how
fast you can make progress on your trek.
         Journey, itself a new exploration in the field of computer
storytelling,was written by Marc Blank, a pioneer in the creation of
interactive fiction. Marc co-authored the original mainframe version of Zork
and the personal computer versions of Zork I, II, and III.
         Journey is now available on the Macintosh and Amiga, and is
scheduled for release on the Apple II, IBM and 100% compatibles in May. All
versions of Journey will retail for $49.95.
 



                 Introducing Arthur: The Quest for Excalibur
                 -------------------------------------------
 
         Imagine sitting your London flat, sharing a Sunday meat with your
family, when...poof!...you turn yourself into an eel. Your Aunt Rose faints
dead away and into her mashed potatoes as your mischievous little brother runs
to capture you in a mayonaise jar for hideous biological experiements.
Although it seems like a little more than a party trick, you'll take this
special power seriously in this game.
         Infocom's newest Graphic Interactive fiction story casts you as the
youthful Arthur on a quest for the legendary sword in the stone that will make
you King of England. You meet up with Merlin, the most famed magicians, who
give you insight into both the world of nature and the nature of man. But
equally as precious a gift is the power to turn yourself into several
different animals. This allows you, as eel or owl or salamander, to get into
places and perform heroic deeds impossible for a mere human.
         The legend of young Arthur comes alive as never before through the
graces of Infocom's newest generation parser. Communicating with the story is
now easier than ever. and mercifully, we decided not to require you to use
Olde English. Nearly 100 pictures enhance your adventure with vivid scenes of
midieval England. For the less aesthetically inclined, the graphics may be
set aside in favor of on-screen mapping, your inventory, or your score.
         The Quest for Excalibur is a 3-day crusade with a finite number of
moves, so don't waste them trying to cultivate a meaningful relationship
with the kraken you hook up with in the lake. And not even a future king gets
something for nothing, so be prepared to offer gold or good deeds as needed to
move along in your quest. You'll need to keep your eyes and ears open to find
the treasures for your trades and the tools for your good deeds. And you can
hone your wits with the riddles sprinkled throughout the game.
         Arthur lived in the Age of Chivalry, a time when virtuewas recognized
and rewarded. Your accomplishments will also be rewarded, earning you points
for Chivalry, Experience, Quest, and Wisdom. All are needed as proof that you
have what it takes to be a righteous king.
         You'll meet many intriguing characters, some nice, some needy, and
some downright nefarious. Included from the classic Arthurian legend are the
evil King Lot, your archrival for the throne, and the mysterious Lady of the
Lake. You'll encounter a spectrum of knights-blue,black, red, and
colorless(but not dull)-- whose zeal for their knightly activities saddles you
with roadblocks. There's a peculiar dragon, a spicy leprechaun, and even a
drooling village idiot. But especially beware the evil demon Nudd, whose
powers rival those of Merlin.
         Arthur offers all the features you've asked for in adventure stories.
Merlin's crystal ball lets you take advantage of on-screen hints. The undo
command makes it possible to rescind even the most foolhardy of decisions. And
the mouse option offers you flexibility you've never had before. This will be
an immediate hit with the fans of fantasy.
         Within the package you will find an illuminated Book of Hours. Arthur
: The Quest for Excalibur will be available in June 1989 for the Macintosh,
Apple II series, IBM, and Amiga computers. Retail price is $49.95 for the
apple II version, and $59.95 for the others. (fuckin' cheap. Raise the price
10 bucks for every other one.)
 



                  Battletech: The Crescent Hawk's Inception
                  -----------------------------------------

         War is the way of life in the 31st century on the Human Sphere. You
are training to be one of the elite warriors. Your education is violently
interrupted by an enemy invasion, and you must save your planet and your life.
Challenge your combat strategy skills, and explore the more than 4 million
individual locations of the game. Exciting graphics and animation show you
everything, from your immediate geography to close-ups of the action.
Battletech is a fully-integrated parts of FASA's Battletech Universe. 

(IBM requires CGA,EGA,VGA, MCGA or Tandy graphics and at least 384k)
IBM- 49.95 (only listing since this is geared to people who have IBM's)
 


                                 Quarterstaff
                                 ------------
 
         In a quiet colony, now deserted, hides the dreadful secret of the
Druid's sudden disappearance. Parties of brave adventurers have gone in search
of the key to the mystery and no one has returned. Now it is your turn to
discover the fate of the Druids. Quarterstaff features a spectacular Macintosh
interface with realistic sound, sparkling color and black and white graphics,
hierarchical menus, contact-sensitive on-screen hints and a dynamic window.
They haven't come out with it for IBM but they will so I put this up.
 



                                  Zork Zero
                                   -------

         Travel through time to Dimwit Flathead's court, where you witness the
powerful curse of Megaboz. Wake up years later as one of your own descendents
and embark on an adventure that tells the story of the classic Zork Trilogy.
Larger than any previous Infocom story, Zork Zero is bursting with dastardly
graphical puzzles, maniacal riddles, and more challenge than the other Zorks
combined. An aggravating court jester takes your gaming skills to the limit in
a devilish round of Double Fanucci. On-screen hints and maps, and friendlier
parser. Zork Zero is the creation of the deranged Steve Meretzky.
 
 
 

           PARSER?? by Stu Galley
          ------------------------ 
 
         What is a parser anyway, and why should it matter to you? Almost any
dictionary can answer the first question, and I'm here to tell you about
second one.
         As the dictionary states, a parser is something that takes apart a
sentence, word by word, and determines what the words mean, and then what the
sentence means. If you ever diagrammed a sentence for an English class, then
you were parsing. But it's a lot easier for you to parse English than it is
for a machine, because you've had a lot more practice at it, and you start
life with a certain natural ability to do it.
         At Infocom, I've been working on a program that will parse your
commands and pass "meaning" to an interactive story. This program is a part of
Zork Zero, and Shogun, as well as future Infocom products that may want to
understand more complex sentences. In a way, I'm like the recording engineer
for your favorite rock album, because my job is to make sure that the artists
talent comes through to you as clearly as possible. If the implentor wants
more adverbs then I give it to him/her. The better I do my job the less you
notice it.
         Almost anyone can write a simple parser program, just as almost
anyone can make simple recordings on their boom box. A simple parser could
parse any two-word sentence,by calling the first word a verb and the second a
noun. If it didn't know the verb,or if the noun wasn't the name of something
in the room, then it would give up. Some simple adventure games work exactly
like this way.
         Until now, Infocom's thirty-odd interactive sotries have all used
parser thatevolved from Zork I. But each new story needed some new features in
the parser, and so it grew more clever,but also more harder to fix and
improve. Eventually we decided to build a new parser from scratch, using the
theory of computational linguistics.(For those BBS'ers who doesn't know what
this means. It means technically, he used an ATN algorithm and an LALR grammer
and one-token look ahead.)
         So what does this mean to you? It means that you can converse with
our interactive fiction more simply than ever, and we can easily add more
features that you've never seen before. So you can talk to characters and
maybe in the future hold an intelligent conversation with the computer or a
character in a story. (This article I found rather interesting and decided to
pass it on to you.)
 


                     Helpful Hints From Customer Support
                    -------------------------------------

 
         Battletech:

              1)When you get to the map room, don't despair. Touch the 7
planets that are listed in the dark green section on page 14 of your manual.
You'll be suprised at what happens.
 
              2)When you get to the Inventor's Hut, you don't exactly feel
welcome? Simple solution: Make sure you have a tech and a medic in your party
and they are both trained to excellence. Bring them to the Hut with you and
the red carpet will be rolled out for you.
 
 

 

         Quarterstaff:

              1)No one knows what the heck to do with the coin and parchment.
So here's what to do. On the lower portion of the parchment, there are four
cryptic messages surrounding a compass rose. These four messages are
instructions for deciphering four different magic words. Each magic word, when
used in conjunction with the magic identity wand (the one depicted in the
upper portion of the parchment), will reveal the nature of
potions,scrolls,keys, or other wands.
 
              2)The first step in deciphering a magic word is to place the
coin on the compass with the coins arrow pointing the prescribed direction.IF
parch. says peering South. Place the coin on the compass rose with the coins
arrow pointing South.
 
              3)Next the message says "let your mind's eye oppposite journey."
Therefore, you begin deciphering at the North point, keeping the coin fixed in
place, pointing South.
 
              4)The message next specifies "four steps to the East." This
means you'll be obtaining a four letter word. Each step equals one letter in
the word.
 
              5)Proceeding around the compass from North to East, the first
letter would then be "G" The G is on the parchment. When deciphering the other
magic words, the first letter may appear on the coin. However, in all cases,
each step will alternate between the parchment and the coin. So, if the first
letter is on the coin, the second letter is on the parchment and so on.
 
              6)Moving from the compass to the coin in the ex., the next
letter is U.
 
              7)Then, moving back out of the compass, the third letter is R.
 
              8)Finally the fourth letter,going back to the coin is Z. You
then end up with GURZ.
 
              9)Now you can identify the nature of an old key and let "no Lock
be your barrier." Simply hold the identify wand and type GURZ OLD KEY.

                                Inside S.S.I
                              ------------------
 
         Well, I'm back with another raving review of Curse of the Azure
Bonds. I could do the Hillsfar one, but basically everyone knows what the game
is about. If you don't and would like to know, then ask somebody!
 
              This summer, S.S.I will release Curse of the Azure Bonds, the
much anticipated sequel to POOL OF RADIANCE.
              Curse of the Azure Bonds, a multi-character fantasy role-playing
game, features beautiful 3-D point of view graphics, dozens of animated
monsters, and exciting tactical combat. The game includes a huge multi-disk
quest and an Adventurers Journal containing maps,clues, and other players
aids.
              The game covers a large area, including some of the most
populous and detailed parts of TSR,inc's FORGOTTEN REALMS game world. Based on
an expanded version of the game system pioneered in S.S.I's best selling Pool
of Radiance, Curse of the Azure Bonds includes higher lvl. characters(over
10th lvl. in each class), new character classes(paladins and rangers), and
many new spells. Curse of the Azure Bonds allows the player to continue the
adventures started in Hillsfar and Pool of Radiance. The player can also
develop new intermediate characters at the start of the game:new players need
not begin with lvl. 1 characters. (COOL!)
              The games contains a completely new adventure inspired by the
Azure Bonds novel written by Jeff Grubb and Kate Novak(where credit is due)
and published by TSR. The computer-game adventure will also be available from
TSR as a paper module to AD&D.
              The Storyline takes your party of player characters from the
quiet streets of Tilverton, through the war ravaged remains of Yulash, to the
Dark Shrine in the evil city of Zhentil Keep.(Where do they get these names?)
At the beginning of the game, the characters awaken to find themselves in
Tilverton with cursed bonds on them with magical runes. A design represents
each bond below the skin on the players arm.
              The party quickly realizes that the bonds cannot be removed by
magic or by force. They also discover that the bonds contain an evil power.
Whenever the runes start to glow, the character does things he/she can't
control. Each bond has a different evil power. Your goal is to remove the
curse of the bonds from each character and find why it was placed on your
characters.
               <ALREADY RELEASED>



                                   OVERRUN
                                 -----------
 
         Overrun! the modern version of Gary Grisby's Panzer Strike. Typhoon
steel game system covers action in the Arab-Israeli wars and combat in the
early 1960's in both the Middle East and Europe. The game contains several
unique features, the map is 50% longer than it was before- allows for the
increased ranges of modern weapons. In addition, the game includes new
technological advances: new armor types, increased accuracy of modern fire-
control systems, and the ability to direct counterbattery fire against enemy
artillery units.
         The inclusion of helicopters constitutes a dramatic change in
Overrun! Helicopters can soar at one of 8 altitudes and either fly slow,fast,
or in a special evade mode that makes them harder to hit. A well-entrenched
defender with a small number of supporting helicopters can wreak havoc on a
careless attacker.
         Other additions include any unit's ability to lay smoke and to spot
units for artillery formations and anit-tank guided missiles. Missiles can
also be very deadly. You can make your own confrontations or play one.
Includes NATO, Israeli, Warsaw PACT, and Arab units. Since the available
weapons range from the T-34 to the T-94 and from the Sherman to the Abrams
tanks, the player can almost design any post WWII tactical combat.
 
              SOON TO BE RELEASED THIS SUMMER!
 
 
 

       Hints for Hero's of the Lance.
      -------------------------------

              1) How do I recharge the Blue Crystal Staff?
                   "In an encounter with Baby Dragons,cast "deflect dragon's
breath" and hold up the staff.
 
              2)How do I get to the third lvl.?
                    Look for holes in the floor and enter these sewer pipes.
This will take you to the final dragon.
 
 
             Coming: Red Lightning
             Experience the next potential war in Europe between NATO and
Warsaw Pact nations. Engage in land and air combat utilizing the most advanced
technology from the Soviet MIG-31 fighter to the U.S. F-117 Stealth Bomber.
                Available soon this Summer.
 
 
              Well, this wraps up the Inside S.S.I newsletter. I wrote about
the things you might want to check out. I'd like to thank S.S.I for giving me
this information. Well, this about sums up all of the game reviews I have done
for you. Later and upcoming issues I might try and do some business software.
If you think this might be a good idea, then drop me a message whereever you
see me around. I have one last thing I wan't to type up.
 
         There are alot of Documents people have written to help the young
carder and the young phreaker. How many of these docs. actually help? Sure,
some of them give some good info. and ideas. They don't necesarily tell you
everything you need to know. I know some people will get a hold of this and
spread it around, acting all bad and shit. Well, these are the type of people
who get caught and rat on other users. So, instead of helping you phreak and
card. I am asking you inexperienced people please stay out of it. You get the
FCC nosing around in our business and other people get caught. So just chill
and be happy with the boards around your state. Also, to the people who pirate
Apex. I saw a copy on Death Metal. People, don't download the program. Aries
has worked long and hard making it the best it possibly can be. He is only
testing it out, he is not giving it out to special people. Time will pass, and
in the future maybe Apex will be available for everyone. There's so many other
software programs, LEAVE APEX ALONE! Well, that about sums up this part of the
newsletter. I hope you have enjoyed it and found it informative. We of API
salute all the people who have helped us construct this newsletter. If you
have ANY thing to comment on or criticize contact an API member near you.
We still need some people who have knowledge in the field of
carding,phreaking, anarchy, etc. If you have a resourceful knowledge of any of
these subjects and would like to contribute to future newsletters then by all
means contact me. Thanks for your time, and please upload this newsletters to
other BBS's! Spread the word, thanks for your cooperation.

FROM MELBOURNE HOUSE:

BARBARIAN
	This is your average run-of-the-mill-beat-the-shit-out-of-
a-bunch-of-different-monsters-until-you-win type game, with not-so-

FROM NEW WORLD COMPUTING:

MIGHT & MAGIC II
	Another wonderful FiRM crack, (ra-ra-ra!), this game is exactly
what a sequal shouldn't be -- an improved version of the first edition.
It has the same set up/lay out, and the graphics and sound haven't really
improved that much... It would be nice to see a company put out a sequal
thats different from the original once in a while. [Although I think
Sierra and Electronic Arts do good sequals].
	If you liked the first MM, then you'll like this one, because
its the same thing. Good ahead and get it. Why not? (Other than a waste
of credit)... Its not that much more challenging from the looks of it either.

_         _
