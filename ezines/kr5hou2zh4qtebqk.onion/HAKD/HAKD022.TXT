So you want to get into a system and learn to hack?

****************************************************

		Whenever you look at a bbs message base concerning hacking, 
	people are always asking where they can obtain an account or how to 
	hack.  Well, I have a surefire method which will provide you with 
	some of the most interesting types of accounts and some info on what 
	you can do with them.  
		Let us first address the problem of accounts.  Most hackers 
	are jealous of there conquests because a person with no knowledge 
	tends to reveal themselves to a system administrator by making stupid 
	mistakes like using the rm command too much or something of the sort.  
	But how can you learn how to hack unless you have some systems to 
	play with?  Well, some people like to scan for systems and then 
	brute force their way in with such novel concept as trying (on a 
	unix system for example) account root/passwd root....well, you will 
	not have much luck this way (good luck if you want to try the rest 
	of those system default accounts like sync (w0w), etc.).  You could 
	get on a public access unix (w0w, they really want to fucking around 
	with their system and who wants to pay for this shit) or get a school 
	account; however, neither of these systems allow you to explore too 
	much and you do not want to hack from your real account.  
		My solution is simple and requires only a bit of nerve.  
	There is a great source of accounts known as the telephone company 
	and the owners of these accounts are not of the highest intellect.  
	They need script files to access all of their wonderful systems, 
	and these script files are graciously stored on their personal 
	computers.  You might wonder how you can get to their computers?  
	Well, you have to go into their buildings and copy these script files 
	for yourself.  A lot of Southwestern bell switching/business offices 
	use simplex locks to lock their doors (some forget to actually lock 
	their doors...some security huh?).  Now you might ask, isn't this 
	illegal?  The answer is yes (and I do not advocate you going into 
	their buildings, of course) but if you really want those neat 
	accounts you might consider it.  I'm not saying that you would 
	actually have to steal anything from their offices, just copy their 
	script files (bring disks with you for this).  Anyway though not the 
	simplest of methods for obtaining accounts, it does work very well 
	and can provide you with the types of accounts you only hear of.  
	For example:
	microlink ][:  a network of phone company machines like internet 
	or telenet.  The systems mainly run unix, and the  security is weak.  
	The systems seem to be databases of information (like how to use fone 
	company stuff (on-line manuals!!!!)) or general e-mailing systems for 
	administrative purposes.
	lmoss: a really neat system that is used to inspect the working of 
	the fone lines.  There is not much data about using these systems 
	available and if you could find any, please send it to me at the 
	systems listed at the end of this document.
	cosmos: the biggie.  If you can get any live accounts on these 
	systems, most experienced hackers would probably like to use 
	them...very good if you want to trade info.
	other systems depending on who the persons computer you are copying 
	the script files from.  
	The script files are for telix, but you can just type them and get 
	the fone numbers for the system, the accounts, and the passwords...or 
	you can run telix like those big boys do (even get a free copy from 
	the fone company...w0w!).
		Well, now that you have these neato-keen systems, how do you 
	use them?  Well, since you are already inside of the building you 
	might as well see what kind of manuals you can borrow from them.  
	The switching rooms seem to have the best manuals in them...like 
	cosmos guides and the like.  Also, you can pick up neat things like 
	an official fone company jacket or hat.  Anyway, be creative and 
	have fun.        
		This file is for information purposes only and does not 
	mean to incite people to enter fone company property and take their 
	stuff.  I do not endorse the hypothetical criminal actions 
	mentioned in this file.  I am not responsible for any actions of any 
	individual who reads this file and acts upon the contents thereof 
	nor is the baby mine...I have never seen this woman and never had 
	sex with her.
