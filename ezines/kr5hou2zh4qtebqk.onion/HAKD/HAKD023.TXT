   A unit can be made on site using mostly found materials.  First, a hole is
 dug which holds a minimum of 5 gallons of water.  It is lined with 6 or 8 mm
 polyethylene or similar watertight material.  6 or 8 pieces of nylon woven
 cord about 3/8" thick are strung along the walls of the hole from bottom to
 top leaving an extra foot at the top.  These will serve as wicks to bring
 water to the plant roots.
   
   The hole is about half filled with a combination of lava or gravel and
 wood chips.  The top half is filled with 5 parts or lava gravel or wood
 chips mixed with one part finely chopped compost, good quality loam or
 vermiculite (available at garden shops).  This mixture will hold enough mois-
 ture for the roots, even on hot sunny days.  Lay the extra length of wicks on
 top of the filled hole.
   
   Next, make a mixture of one part lava, gravel or wood chips with one part
 loam and pile it at least 8" over the top of the filled hole.  It may be
 easier to hold the pile in place using a small frame such as bricks or rocks.
 This pile will stay moist, but allow the roots to breathe.
   
   If the area receives a lot of rain, a small channel should be formed at top
 of the hole to funnel water away.  The reservoir below will fill with water 
 from rain or can be irrigated occasionally.  To check water levels a simple
 water gauge can be designed.  A plastic tube as long as the gole and pile is
 placed vertically in the hole before it is filled.  A bamboo stake with a 
 cork attached at the bottom is placed in the tube.  The  cork will rise to 
 the surface level of the water, indicating how many inches of water are being
 held.
