Well another issue of Beneath The Remains is out and this issue will be on
getting high off of NUTMEG.  Yes I did just say NUTMEG.


The great chemical in Nutmeg is Myristicin.  Here's the defination:  


-=ðþð=--=ðþð=--=ðþð=--=ðþð=--=ðþð=--=ðþð=--=ðþð=--=ðþð=--=ðþð=--=ðþð=--=ðþð=-
                             
                               Myristicin
     
        A toxic, crystalline, safrole derivative present in star
        anise,parsley seed oil, and nutmeg oil. When ingested in
        large quantities, can cause convulsions, hallucinations,
                     tachycardia, and possibly death.

-=ðþð=--=ðþð=--=ðþð=--=ðþð=--=ðþð=--=ðþð=--=ðþð=--=ðþð=--=ðþð=--=ðþð=--=ðþð=-


Don't get paranoid about the convulsions, hallucinations, tachycardia, and 
possibly death.  By the way, what the hell is TACHYCARDIA?  Never heard of
it.  Oh yeah... Back to the text file.  I have done nutmeg a few times and
never had a problem.   You wont either if you dont go over the recommended
dosage.  So follow this shit exactly and I am shure you won't die or  have
convulsions, or (Dmmm) TACHYCARDIA.  The great thing about nutmeg is  it's
like .99 cents for a lot, and it is readaly available at  ANY supermarket.

Here's what chu do:
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

Id advise you to do this with a friend so incase you flip out, he'll be there
Go buy 1 small can of nutmeg.  Get out a teaspoon.  Fill the tablespoon up 
with your nutmeg stash, even it off at the top.  Yeah this shit tastes bad
so eat it QUICK with LEMONADE, or OJ, or Coke (not the drug:):):))........

I WOULD NOT ADVISE TAKING MORE THAN 3 TABLESPOONS FULL, IF YOU DO YOU WILL
START V0MITING AND CONVULSING.   You'll see hallucions but there N0T cool
a friend of mine did it, and almost died, DONT EXCEED THE RECOMMENDED DOS
AGE!!!!..

Ok enuf with that, you get the point.  After you take the 1 teaspoon full
then wait.  Start watching television or something.  Then in anywhere from
30 minutes to 3 hours you'll start to feel W3|R|> (weird).  You'll get
shivery, put a blanket on.  Then you'll start laughing yer ass off.  Just
relax and enjoy it.  When I did it, I did a little more than 1 teaspoon
(like a HEAPING) teaspoon of nutmeg.  It was wierd, here's my story.


My story:

I took the heaping teaspoon of nutmeg. And about an hour later
I'm watching TV with my friend, and (he didnt do it, just me)
I started getting cold.  I got a blanket, and I was still shaking
and started giggling.  Things got weird, It's not weird like you
get scared.  You just feel a bit HiGH like pot.  Except you feel
a little sick (stomach).  Take some pepto-bismol before you do this.
It lasted about 5 hours.  I went to MC donalds and I kept trying to
say 'CAN I HAVE A NUMBER ONE, please'  But it kept coming out 
"San I Ave A Nuber Un.".  That's pretty much what happens to me
anyway.. And another friend did it, and felt the same way (with
the same dosage)..  But this kid i know (and i told him about) did
it with 5 fucking teaspoons.  About 3 hours later he was hallucating
and it was N0T cool.  He couldn't walk straight.  He was like on
sort of a bad trip.  So dont do it more than I said.  Also dont
fucking abuse it.  Dont goto your 7-11 and buy 22 fucking cans of 
it or 'HABABBE' (yeah one of those guys with the towels on there head)
will say "I not want druggies my store!"  With the stupid accent.



'TILL NEXT TIME



PS. i smoked about 2 big bowl worths of it. And then some pot, i was pretty
fucked up. After i came down (or thought) i and a freind drank 3 1/2 beers
each. I HANVENT BEEN SO FUCKING DRUNK IN SOOOOOOOOO LONG! That nutmeg fucks 
you up when it is mixed with alcohol. If i had drank the usual (like 7 -10)
i would have puked. i was close, so try that its fun!!!!
