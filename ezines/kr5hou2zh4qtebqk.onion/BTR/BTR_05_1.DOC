All about pot.

This Text is gonna be 1oo times better then the other BTR on growing pot..
Sorry that peice of shit slipped thru somehow. It shouldnt have though.
The guy who wrote it is gone now. :( So, heres to make up for it.

Growing, Cultuivating, Harvesting it etc. etc. etc
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

When you buy a bag, break up the bud's a little and pick out all the seeds.
(Seeds will now be refered to as Beeners)  These should NeVeR be thrown away
for they are the most important part.  For they are what will bring you more
pot! So save 'em all and smoke away... You'll thank yourself in the morning:)
If you cant get beeners dont goto some lame store like De Ja Vu and buy those
roasted hemp seeds and waste your money, they'll never grow, and even if they
did, they spray them so it would be shitty any ways. 

[ş úGrowing Marijuana Indoorsú ş]

What you will need is beeners (about 1 in every 3 grows) (to tell if they
will grow, throw them on a hot frying pan and if they crack, they will). 
You will also need a good source of light. Use a 75 Watt bulb in a desk lamp
(if you dont have a plant lite handy), dont use the kind that has a shade
use the kind that has an arm.  You'll also need some good soil (Potting soil,
hence the name) and miracle grow, and water).  Soak your beeners in a small
cup with toilet paper in the bottem, put in luke warm h2o.  Leave them alone
for 2 or 3 days, you'll see a little root possibly, but if not, dont fear
just plant them and they'll come up when their ready.  The great thing about
growing indoors is, less chance of getting busted and the plants are skimpyer
but more resin! So all the better.  Get a planter box about 4 ft long and 9 "
wide (depending on amount of beeners)  Put potting soil in it, and dig small
hole (about 1/2" deep) about 6" apart.  Put 3 or 4 beeners to each hole, for 
some wont grow. (Once, I was growing for about 6 months, with nice healthy
plants, and a new one came up, just a late starter :))  Pack the Dirt in all
over.  Now water, and give 1o - 12 hours lite, (With the sun schedule), then 
give them darkness.  You'll start to see them come out of the soil in about 
1 or 2 weeks.  Use a small amount of Miracle Grow mixed in with the water and
you'll see a big difference in growth.  Now about 4 months or whenever you 
feel ready (for they are YouR plants) Harvest, if you are in a hurry, but if
your not in a hurry then let them grow until they are starting to die (*you
might not be able to let them grow till they die, cause some get quite big*)
Now pick and dry and smoke.  

[ş úGrowing Marijuana Outdoorsú ş]

You dont have to do as much for this, for you are plating your Marijuana in
its natural habitat.  Soak beeners the same way as indoors, for a few days.
Find a sunny, not noticeable spot.  Dont do it on your land, unless you plan
on denying you ever knew about it. (Dont)  Dig the holes about 1" deep a few
feet apart.  4 - 6 beeners to a hole.  (its harder to get them growing).. Now
water, and let be.  Hopefully mother nature will be kúrad kool to you, and
you'll get some nice buds..  The plants will look much stronger, and thicker
then the indoor ones.  But a little weaker.  You cant change male or female
if growing outside. 




[ş úGetting more out of your WeeDú ş]                   

If your weed is realitivly weak, or you want it stronger, try this, get
an amout of weed in a ziplock baggie, and dampen the weed. Zip it up, and
put it in a dark closet for 2 or 3 weeks, it will get a little moldy but
its better, better potency.

When your done with your bowls worth, tap the bowl (and all the ash) into a 
baggie, and save it for a while.  Believe it or not, ash has THC still in
it, you just have to extract it.  Put the amount of ash into a pot of water
and bring to a boil. When it boils lower the heat to about Medium. Boil till
there is no more water, and just nasty shit.  Scrape up that nasty shit into
a bunch of bowl size cubes (make sure it is small enuf to be smokealbe in a
bowl)  Wait till it drys (Dont microwave), smoke.  That will kick all the THc
and res out of the ash.  Ash should never be thrown away.  Do the same with
stems, for they also contain ALOT of Thc.

Scrape your bowl, about every 2 months, save the black thick stickey stuff, 
that is all the weed you have smoked all condensed. it is strong, so keep 
saving this shit into a ball, untill you have some weed less nite..

If you smoke out of a bong then Never change the water, use the same.  Also
dont be stupid and think your cool by drinking the bong water, this will not
only make you look stupid, it will make you very sick.  It is all the crap
from the weed you've smoked. Even though its all crap, you can get baked off
it, so dont waste it.  This is the prcedure for extracting hash from bong 
water. Im not really sure if this is hash that you will be making, ive just
heard that it is. No garuntee.  Take the bond water, put it in a pot, and 
boil till the water is gone.  Then take put in fresh water, and boil again.
When it is all gone, compress all the crap left (No where NEAR as much as you
started)  and smoke.  Very good, potent stuff.  You could sell it, but dont
get into selling.  You'll get in a lot of Trouble if busted.



[ş úSome notesú ş]

You can Dry pot in a microwave, buts its always better in a book (for a small
amount) or just air dry.  In a microwave, Be sure not to over cook it, or it
will have been a total waste of time reading this, and spending some of your
life growing, put the weed on a paper towel, and put on TiMECooK for 20 sec's
and then if not dry enuf, change paper towel and do again.

There are two types of plants out there. Male & Female, you want more Female
and its possible to get more, thats in the next note.  Male plants can get you
stoned but they are no where as strong as female.  

To get more females try interrupting the sun schedule with 1 hour of light
in the middle of the night, every nite for a while, and it will shock the
plant into budding, which is good (incase you didnt know?)  That will 
produce more females.

Most weed contains from 1 to 4 % THC (tetrahydracanaboil (sp??)) which gets
you ripped in the first place.  4 Percent THC weed is considered good shit,
and 1 you shouldnt pay more then 50$ for an ounce of it.  

When your buying weed (in a large amount) make sure you sample it before,
it really sux getting ripped off, when you cant do anything about it.
And also make sure you know and trust the dealer.


[ş úForward, and afterwardsú ş]

Good luck on growing your pot and dont blame me if you get busted, this is
a text, and only a text..  If this has been a reel text, you would be 
notified by instructions flashing at the bottom of your screen.  Until next
time...  Have fun..
