Is Scanning Legal?
------------------

Defination of Scanning :

Scanning [skannin] : Calling #'s in sequencial order looking for intresting
                     things, carriers, loops, pbx's etc. etc. etc.


A while ago I was scanning 8oo nums like mad [using PsychoScan of course :)]
I was doing it 24/7 every day for 5 days to a week.I was getting mad karryerz
I had about 70 or 80 a day!  I thought this was all well and good until a week
later when i got a letter from AT&T's 8oo watz services saying: (something 
like)

You have been abusing the AT&T wats service and exceeded your maxium number
of calls 2ooo a month. If you are running a business then please tell us, or
else the next offense will result in a $1o,ooo fine and/or imprisionment.


I called an operator and asked to be transfered to AT&T, then talked to an
operator for a while, and asked why couldnt i dial 8oo nums? she was nice in
the begining then she said she'd call me back with the info, when she did she
was a bitch about it.  She said that i was breaking the law and might get a
fine, so i kindly told her to fuck off. and hung up..  They turned off my 8oo 
services for about 2 weeks, then it came back on.  This is all well and good
but now we get to the question :  Is scanning legal.  Well we dont relly have
an answer for you.  Once i called an operator and said 'I was wondering if
it would be legal if I (with my computer) called every 800 number sequencially
and she said 'Yes i dont see why not, as long as you dont prank call anyone'
and as long as i dont call the same number over and over its okay.  Well she
says it is and they say it isnt.  I have a good mind to write them a fucking
letter telling them to get their story straight.  So my question was never 
answered. Is skanning legal?


I think we should find out, and make it legal if it isnt.  Afterall they dont
know we scan to find things to hack.  We could just say were looking for not
known bbs's in the 800 exchange?

If anyone gets any info on this topic, please send it in imediatly to AWoL

Later
