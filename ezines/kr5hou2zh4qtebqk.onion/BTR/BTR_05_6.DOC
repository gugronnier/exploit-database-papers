DESCRIPTION:
The Nine Inch Nails box is a box file that allows you to broadcast music and
voice over the PA system at your local school.  It is illegal, i should guess,
but it is lots of fun, and it would be hard to get caught after it is installed
(unless you are an idiot and you blab it all over.  Remember, i am NOT
responsible for what you do, so Nyahhhhh!

BUILDING IT:
In order to build it, you will need:
<=A microphone ( for those of you who find a secluded spot, or those idiots)
    --or--
<=A Lunch Box (i will attach a piggyback to the arj containing the destructions)
    --or--
<=A standard stereo or Walkman

<=Wirecutters
<=Screwdriver
<=A Good Diversion (tm)
 
Step I
First off, find the box containing the PA speaker.  Then, using your Good 
Diversion (tm), unscrew the box and quickly cut into the two wires connecting 
the speaker to the school.  Be sure to leave these connected to the speaker, or
your box will be over shortly, as the speaker won't work and the school will
repair it, finding your box.  Just strip the wires, and attach a piggyback
wire to each.  Cover these quickly with electrical tape or shrink wrap, or the 
sound signal might get fuzzy.  At this point, you may want to replace the PA,
should your Good Diversion (tm) run out of late.

MICROPHONE:
Step II
De-attach the plug with the wire cutters.  Strip the wire back.  There may be
two wires parellel to each other, in which case attach one to each side of the
speaker.  In another case, there may be another insulateds wire inside the 
first.  In this case, attach the outer wire to one wire of the speaker and the
other to the remaining wire.  Should the mic have two different color, mettalic 
wires (ie one blue, no insulation, one red, no insulation), it is too hard to
do, and you should get another microphone.  Tape up the entire ensemble and
to what you will with it.  
To Use
Just talk into the mic.  It should work over the whole system, lest you have an
newer system.  Still, it may work.  By the way, if the microphone is not a 
battery operated one, you will need to wait until the PA is used to talk to the 
students.
WALKMAN:
Step II
Get an old pair of headphones (REAL old; the new ones have that stupid blue and
red metal wires).  Cut off the phones.  Attach the two inner wires to the two
outer wires, or red to red and blue to blue (strip the insulation first, 
please), etc.  Attach one side to each speaker wire.
To Use
Attach the unit to the headphone jack.  In order to work it, just press play.
LUNCH BOX:
Step II
Get the receiver.  Take off the part attached to the earphone.  Attach one side
to each speaker wire.
To Use
Make sure the unit is on.  Transmitting should play through the unit.  In order 
to play music, make the headphone attenuator described under WALKMAN, only 
attach it to the wires where the microphone goes.

APPENDIX B:  Simple troubleshooting.

Problem                 Reason                Solution

Unit does not work.     No power.             Add in an amplifier, between the 
                                              speaker wires and the sound unit

                        Wires not connected.  Connect the wires and try again.

                        You fucked it up      Take up a new hobby, maybe 
                        real bad.             woodcarving or toy collecting.
                        
Sound is fuzzy.         Tape isn't on good    Readjust the tape.
                        enough.

                        Connetion is bad.     Solder the wires.

Sound is too loud.      Too much power.       Tone it down with resistors.
        
                        Too loud volume.      Turn down the volume.

Sound is too soft.      Not enough power.     Add in some capaciters.

                        Too soft volume.      Turn it up, dumbass.

The music sucks.        Stupid tape.          Play something cool.

You get caught.         You are an idiot.     Get a knife and slit your 
                                              wrists, chode.

Have fun, and always remeber, TUESDAY'S THE DAY!.
