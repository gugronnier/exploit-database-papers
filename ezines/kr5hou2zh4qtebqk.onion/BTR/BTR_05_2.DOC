I would call this book:

'Tales From The Knightmare And Other Short Stories'

The author, 'The Knightmare' is the 'Super Hacker'. At first
you may be a little skeptical about this title he has, but
read on and you will say "WoW he seems to be a some form 
of a super hacker". I say this because this book is chock 
full of stories of how The Knightmare did this and The 
Knightmare did that. In most books that would be a negativo. 
But not in this case. He tells of dumpster diving, sneaking 
into cubicles, breaking and entering and many other fine arts.

On one story he gets his library card validated to a full 
librarian access so he has access to do whatever he wants
with books and peoples accounts. He does this by writting
a program that throws random bar code numbers into the pen
light in the library computer. NiCE job.

Includes information on these useful topics....

Look for this book at 'Barnes & Noble' (WoLF RoAD, LaTHaM,
New York) Or Borders across the street. Theres this guy that
works at B&N I social engineered him and got him to pay for some
of the book! I could tell you about the B&N computer but that  
would take too long. Maybe in another issue or something. Just 
ask for it by title all of the salespeople (well almost) have 
heard of it, if they haven't they sure as hell will know how to 
find it by the title. But sometimes certain salespeople don't 
feel right letting books like that into the open public even 
then they are in the open public. (To back me up by saying this 
just read the letters in 2600!)

Or just look down...

In my opinion The Knightmare did a good job of the history of hacking by 
including the major milestons and things that have populated the hacker 
community as we now know it. If you want to buy a book on Computer Hacking
History then read Bruce Sterling's "The Hacker Crackdown". The Knightmare
did a good job of covering a lot in a little amount of space. But again the
point of the book was to be a new wave book on hacking. Chapter Two: The
History of Hacking is the only real section on the history it is 5 pages long.
That doesn't seem like much but I'd have to take a guess the book is about
12"tall by 7" wide. So it makes good reading.

At the begining of this book there is an introduction by a man named Gareth
Branwyn who seems to be pretty intouch with Cyberspace and the whole consept
of hacking. And Gareth goes through the many scenarios that would go on as:
Hacker as Independant Scientist
Hacker as Cowboy
Hacker as Techno-Terrorist
Hacker as Pirate
Hacker as Biblical David
Hacker as Security Informat
Hacker as U.S. Calvary
Hacker as Cyborg
and The Knightmare's Vision.

After the main book theres a section "Further Reading" that contains about 20
books on things that can make you a better hacker and have a better hacker
backround. Theres even a book of phone numbers on people to call who will
know numbers for just about everything!

Secrets of A Super Hacker goes by 3 sections with many chapters in each 
section.  PART ONE: Before Hack. PART TWO: During Hack. PART THREE: After 
Hack. Then after all of that fine reading there is a glossary that contains
words from 'acoustic coupler' - 'worm'. It is a very fine developed glossary
containing roughly 175+ definitions. Then the Appendices.
