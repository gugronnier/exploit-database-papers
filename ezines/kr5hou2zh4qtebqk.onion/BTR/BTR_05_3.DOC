                        How to merc shit from Radio Shack
                                by:  Ramon!


Part One - Security:

Ha! What a joke! There is no security whatsoever at ANY Radio Shack I've ever 
seen. There are no magnetic alarms at the door,that thing that beeps as you 
enter the store is just to let employees (who are probably goofing off in 
back) know that there's someone coming in or out.  Go ahead, stuff your 
pockets when no one's looking and walk out.  They'll never know!

Cameras?  Not!  If a Radio Shack has a camera, there is only ever one and 
it can't cover the whole store.  Find the camera, which is usually in full 
view, and steal shit from where it's not pointing.  Even if you get filmed, 
most likely they'll never know what you stole is missing until they've 
already re-used the tape!  Another tip is to go at the end of the day just 
after they've been open for 8 1/2 hours.  By then the VHS tape will have run 
out and stopped recording.  Employees are either too busy or too lazy to 
change it anyway.  Most of the time they forget to start the tape at all!

Part Two - Tactics:

I suggest you go in with at least one or more partners.  However, if you go 
in alone, Go when it's packed with people looking at expensive shit like 
computers.  They'll keep the salesmen occupied while you rob them blind.  
Radio Shack employees are REQUIRED to greet you when you enter the store and 
offer you help.  To get rid of them, act slightly rude and tell them that 
you can find what you're looking for yourself.  That will get rid of them 
for good and they'll return to goofing off.

If you've got a couple of accomplices (I suggest three people total), go to 
one of the strip plaza stores (mall stores are riskier because they have more 
employees). Strip plaza stores usually only have two employees working at the 
same time, and if you're lucky there will only be one.  Find the deadest 
store possible.  Have the person with the light fingers go in first, be rude 
to the saleman and then go skulk in the corner with all the resistors and 
shit.  The salesmen work on commission and hate people who buy .99 cent shit.  
Have the second and third person arrive shortly afterward (remember: you 
don't know each other!!!).  Have these people distract the salesmen by 
inquiring about expensive products (not the ones you want to steal obviously)
Ask dumb questions like technical specifications and when the salesman can't 
answer them, demand to see the manual for it!  This will cause the person to 
go digging around the disorganized stock room for a while trying to find the 
box for it. One down.  Another tactic is to ask for a demonstration.  Two 
down!  While these idiots are distracted, the first person is free to fill up 
his coat or whatever with valuable merchandise!  I've seen people get out of 
there with VCRs, CD Players, cordless phones, even a fax machine!  Radar 
detectors and scanners are the easiest, though, so you might want to start 
with them.  The sale displays by the door just beg you to rob them!  Some 
even have full boxes that you can return without a receipt and exchange for 
what you really want.  They do require a receipt for cash back, tho'.

The only danger that you should possibly worry about is someone in back 
watching the camera monitor.  Easily found out if you call the store from a 
payphone during the robbery and see if someone other than the people up front 
answers.  (also a great distraction!)

Part Three - Disclaimer:

***ATTENTION!***  If you are stupid enough to get caught doing this, then 
you deserve to go to jail!  It's so fucking easy, though, a moron could do 
it.  Nonetheless, I take absolutely no responsibility for anything that might 
happen to you, so go ahead and tell 'em I told you to do it.  They'll probably 
laugh in your face.
