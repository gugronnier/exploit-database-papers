~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
1ú800ú504ú1115 Normal Number
1ú800ú203ú1225 Holiday Greeting Number (Same Purpose) Expires 06ú30ú96

A Recorded Message Says:

"Welcome To Long Distance Greetings From Hallmark and Sprint"

"Hit 1 If You Have A Touch Tone Phone"

"Please Stay On The Line If You Are Using A Rotary Dial Phone"

        If You Don't Touch 1 You'll Have A Live Sprint Operator. 
        You Have To Read The Bitch Your Card Number Manually.

Once You Have Correctly Punched In A Correct Code You'll Hear:
        "You Have Been Granted 10 Free Minutes"
                (On Most Cases This Is True)

Notes 
~~~~~
ş I Live In Albany, NY. These Have Been Available Since June '94. I Hear
  Atlanta Hasn't Received Them Yet.

ş If You Want To Speed Up Your Call You Can't Really. But You Can Enter
  1 For Touchtone Just A Second After The Beginning Welcome Message. And
  You Can Enter The # While She Asks For It. 

ş I Have Heard Rumors That They Have Cards With Like 1-2 Hours On Them.
  Plus Since When You Enter The Average Card Number You Hear This...
  
  "You Have Been Granted 10 Minutes From Hallmark and Sprint"
  
  The 10 Is Said In A Different Voice Meaning That There Must Be Another
  Recording Claiming 10 And They Have More On Phile Somwhere.So If They 
  Say 10 Minutes That Means They Wouldn't Waster Their Time By Having 1 
  Message That Said That. Meaning There Must Be Messages That Say More Time.
  
  I Haven't Seen Any Like $15 Cards Like This From HallmarkúSprint.
  But If Anyone Sees Something That's More Expensive Lemme Know On
  AWoL. Plus Give Me The Number Once Your Done With It So I Can 
  Try To Find An Algorithm Or Figure Some Pattern Or Something.

ş I Have Heard A Rumor That With A * Command You Can Transfer Time From
  Other Cards.

ş Shit I Just Realized It Says "Whatever # Of Minutes On Your Card" Is Cuz
  You Can Use 'Em More Than Once. I Used 1 Then Got A Busy Signal, Tried
  Again, Full Time Left. So You Can Use Your Card As Many Times You Want 
  Until The 10 Minutes Are Used.

ş 10-Minue Call Per Card. (Usually)

ş While It Connects Your Call You Hear The Annoying Jingle:
        "Hallmark Has The Way To Show We Care"
  
  Antedevulian(sp?) And I Would Just Like To Issue A Thanks A Fucklot
  For Helping Phreaks Across The World. =>

ş So If Your Going To Call A Board For 10úMinutes Call Up HallmarkúSprint
  Do The Shit Then Have Your Modem Program (úie Qmodemú) Do The Dirty Work
  & Dial. 
  
ş Remember Always Put The Dial Time Up To Near 60 Seconds Or It'll
  Fuck Everything Up. On Speed Dialing Ofcourse. (úATS1=33ú)

ş It's Also Easier To Start Dialing Towards The End Of The Message Since
  The Modem Prog Takes A Few Seks To Get To The Open Line.

ş After 9-Minutes Time Has Elapsed You Hear:

        "Your Call Has 1 Minute Left"
  
ş After You Try And Use A Card That Has Been Used Fully You Hear  
                "I'm Sorry The Maximum Time On Your Call-Card Has Been 
                Used. Thank You For Using Hallmark And sprint."

ş So If You Call Some Board When The OnúLine Timer Says Like 8:50 
  Hang The Hell Up. Cuz If Yer On When The Operators Voice Goes On
  It Fucks Up Yer Kall Pretty Bad.
 
ş They Fucking Round Up Man. Let's Say You Use 5:20 On 1 Card. Then L8r
  Use It, You Will Have 4 Minutes Left, When They Should Be Nice + Give
  You 5.

ş After The Full 10-Minutes You Hear:
        "Thank You For Using Voice Greetings From Hallmark & Sprint"
         Then It Repeats Twice And Hangs-Up On You.

ş Good For Calling Warez Boards And Just Getting The Applications And 
  Doing Quick Stuff Like That. Or Calling Board Just To Get An Account.

ş I Don't Know If Hallmark And/Or Spring Keeps Track Of How Many Times
  A Number Has Been Tried From A Certain Number.

ş After Using A Number That Was Already Used You Hear:
        "I'm Sorry, The Maximum Number Of Minutes On Your Call Card Has                       
         Been Used. Thank You For Using Hallmark & Sprint"

ş After Entering 3 Consecutive Invalid Call-Card Numbers You Get Transfered
  To A Voice Operator.

  The Voice Operator Is Really A Sprint Calling Card Tech. Support Operator.
  Not A Hallmark Employee. I Found Out Hallmark Transfers You To Another Line
  (ú1ú800ú366ú0707úSprint)

ş After 2 Invalid Phone #'s Entered You Get Transfered To (Look UP) Customer
  Service.

ş As For calling international, you basically can't. BUt you can make all
  Calls Within The US, Puerto Rico And The US Virgin Islands.

ş Dloading & Uploading While Online Through This Doesn't Make Anything 
  Slower.

ş I Just Got Pissed Off At Fucking Hallmark Since I Stole Some Nums Today
  And 1 Uv Em Didn't Werk. I Just Then Checked My 'USED CARD LOG' And Saw
  That Number Already There. That Fucking Pissed Me Off. Don't Let This
  Happen To You!!

ş FUCK LISTEN TO THIS. THESE CARDS AREN'T THAT SAFE. I CALLED THE QUESTIONS
  # SINCE I STOLE A CARD THAT HAD BEEN USED ALREADY. THEN I TOLD THEM THE
  # AND THE OPERATOR SAID THE NPA + PRE WHERE THAT CARD HAD BEEN USED AND
  THE NPA + PRE THAT THEY CALLED! THAT MEANS THEY KNOW MY #! AND THEY'LL KNOW
  YOURS TOO!! I MAY BE IN A BIG TRAP BUT I DON'T KNOW. AWAIT A FURTHER 
  FOR MY FATE.

New Holiday Cards
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
ş Just The Other Day I Found Out They Released A Whole New Set Of Cards. That
  Have A X-Mas Theme To Them. 

ş Now If You Call 1-800-203-1225. Which Is The Number To Use Yer Holiday #
  With. (IT Works On Both Though) The 0nly Difference Is That You Hear The 
  Bitch Say:

        "Happy Holidays" Then Her Normal Bullshit.

          Call Anyone...Anytime...On Any Phone(rotary or touch-tone)
          ...On Any Fone Servie!

          1. Dial       1-800-203-1225  (listen for directions)
          2. When asked, enter this code: XXX-XXX-XXXX
          3. Call any number in the U.S., Puerto Rico, or the US Virgin 
             Islands.

        Make one call or several short ones.
        A reminder message will let you know when 60 seconds remain on 
        your call card. Nothing will appear on you phone bill. Enjoy!

Hack [ed] & [ing] ed Card Numbers 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
ş In The Format XXXúXXXúXXXX

ş I Have To Silence The Popular Belief That Theres A Format With A
        '0' As The Second Digit and '3' As The Eighth Digit.
        (As Told Of In "BTR03-7.DOC")
        
        Not By Treason (From BTR03-7.DOC)

        I Don't Want To Go Telling You.

        And More Which I Don't Have On Phile.

        Plus I Gave A Few Numbers To My Pal Substance 
        
        (Plus I Won't List Sum Since I Always 
         Have A Lot Of Unused Ones Nice And Handy
         For Ready Use When Needed)


Stealing Card Numbers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
This Process Has Absolutely Nothing To Do With Brute Force Attemps
Just To Guess The Right Numbers. It's All About Larceny.

ş  Pick A Store That Sells HallmarkúSprint Cards.
        I go to CVS, Hallmark, and Brooks. (úFaysú?ú)

ş  Locate The Area Of The Store Where The Greeting Cards Are.

ş  Take A Card In Your Hand And Open It. 
   You Will See The Stupid Greeting.
   And The Most Important Part, The Calling Card.
   The Greeting Cards Are Wrapped In Plastic So The Cards Aren't Stolen.
   
   You Don't Need To Commit An Act Of Larceny Just To Make A Free 10 Minute
   Call. (úDid I Just Contradict Myselfú?ú)

   The Cards Are Glued Down In By The Middle Of The Card.
   By Hallmark Glueing Them In The Middle You Can Pull Up On The Top And
   Read The Number. You Have To Pull It Up Pretty Good, Since The Actual
   Number Is Strategically Located Towards The Middle.

ş  Diagram Of The Glued In Card

          The 'x' Is Where The Number Is Located.

ş  A Little Tip Here.
        When At CVS Or Wherever The Card That Looks Like A Red Heart 
        Doesn't Glue The Card In Thouroughly So It Just Wanders Around 
        In The Wrapper. (úIt's Really A Phoneú)

ş  Materials I Bring With Me Is:
        Pen(s)
        Notebook
        Buddy Of Yours
        Backpack
         (2 People Work Faster Than One)

ş  Don't Always Go For The Cards That Are Lying On Top. Odds Are
   Someone Else Already Has The Number. (úie Me :)ú) 
   
ş  I Have Found As Long As You Don't Physically Steal The Card
   No One Cards What Your Doing.

ş Or Take A RaZoR And Make Slits Just Above The Cards So You Can
  Remove With A Greater Of Ease.

ş I Have Also Found The Hallmark Managers Get Mad At You When You 
  Swear At Them When Your Caught.

ş Push Up/Down On The Card To Free It From The Glue. Then You Can Push
  The Plastic Strategically Around To See The Card With A Greater Of
  Ease.
  
ş Good Excuses When Caught Writing Down Card Numbers.
  "I Was Writing Down The Prices"
  "You Mean You Had To Pay For It?"
  "Duhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh"
  "Kall AWoL [ú5i8ú] 383ú1369"
  "I Was Just Making Note Of This Brand For A Later Purchase"              
  "FuCK YoU!!!   
  "YoU KaNT TaLK 2 M3 LiK3 TH4T, i'M @ \/\/@r3Z d00D!!"
  
   Or Just Make Something Up Yourself, Or Just Say
