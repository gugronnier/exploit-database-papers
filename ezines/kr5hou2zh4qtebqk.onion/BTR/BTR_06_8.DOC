          A NEW PHREAKING DEVICE/PROCEDURE BY ANTEDILUVIAN [PAiN]
 FORWARD AND FOREWARNING:

   The Answer Box is a new device/procedure that can enable a person to make
 phone calls at the expense of another individual. The author does not assume
 any responsibility for crimal activity associated with the use of The ANSWER
 BOX. 
   Now that you are bored as shit, I guess I should tell you the purpose of 
 this box. To put it simply, it allows you to make 3rd party fone calls that
 cannot be refused. No more hassle, no more bullshit. And here is how you do
 it:

 ITEM LIST:

 1 cheap answering machine (approx $20) (or you could card one)
 1 10' length of fone cord
 1 cassette tape for the answering machine
 1 target house
 1 extension cord of approximately 25' 
 1 regular screw driver (medium sized)
 2 aligator clips (possibly)

 WHAT TO DO:

   Take your answering machine and record one of a couple messages:

 1: <5 beat pause> "Yes, I accept."
 2: "Hello, yes we will accept a collect call from <name>."
 3: <some other variant>

   Put the tape in the machine. Hopefully, you have picked a site from which
 you intend to box. Choose the site as you would a beige boxing target. Check
 out the telco box. If the telco box has a modular jack inside you can skip
 the next part, production.

 PRODUCTION:

 1. Strip a length of fone cord to expose the four wires inside (red, green,
   yellow, and black).
 2. Strip the red and green wires.
 3. Fasten an aligator clip to each of the two bare wires.
 4. If the other side does not have one, attach a modular fone plug.
   
 MORE OF WHAT TO DO:
  
   Now you wait till the occupants of the house (if any) are asleep and you
 attach to their house, the answering machine (exactly as if it were a beige
 box). Plug in your fone cord and run it as from the house as possible, still
 leaving enough cord to keep the device concealed. (you don't want them to 
 look out a window and say, "Look there Martha, it's one of them fone phreaks
 and he's got his doggoned blasted 'boxes' connected to our house!" because
 they see this cord sticking straight out from the house into a bush=]) 
   Now connect the answering machine to the external outlet of the house (I
 have never seen a house without one) via the extension cord. You might want
 to make sure you have the damn machine either silent or at the very least
 (if it is really sheap) muffled as hell. If you don't know the number of the
 household's fone, you can either call an ANI or:

   Look at the mailbox, check for a name, if none is giving, extract a piece 
 of mail from the box or from the trash and read the name. Go home, look up
 the name in your fone book and wallah!.

 That is finished so go home now stupid=]. Once you are inside, call the fone
 number of the target and make sure you get the recorder.
 PROCEDURE FOR MAKING A CALL:

   No more shitty connections from a beige box (old telco box with no fone
 jack) or worry about the climate (if it is bad, protect the answer box from
 the elements) 
   To place a call, do one of several things, the best being to call collect
 third party, anonymously (they can look at their bill and get your number
 if you don't) or use a diverter. Now, when the operator asks for the number
 to which the bill is to go, give him/her/it the fone number of the target.
   The call is then accepted.  Now, if you are doing this to call an LD BBS,
 you might want to make the initial part of the call voice, then as it is 
 being accepted, dial your modem quickly (or type ATA) an you will connect.
 
 OTHER USES:

   You could set this up somehwere where it would not be discovered and use 
 it somewhat like a PBX (not really) or if you just skip the 3rd party part,
 and make it collect, you have a VMB! This file took me about an hour to
 fully compose, I hope that you can make sense of it. Later..
                                                             Ante
                               SHOUTS [NEXT]
  I'd like to say 'sup to about a million people...                                 
  
   All the 20+ members of PAiN (growing all the time), the former members of
  both ShOcK and EViL. Former members of the original PAiN (bashing group I
  was leader and founder of a long time ago). ViRuS? and all the people at
  DCi and ACCESS DENIED. The sysops of all boards carrying PAiN files. All
  the people at SOB, the guys of FUCK (console group). All the hackers and
  phreaks I have ever known who weren't punks who thought because they read 
  an issue of phrack and went to a 2600 meeting once, they are cool. 
   
   Also, I would like to send some personal greets to:
  
  DarkEYE, Sryth, imAgE, Dark Warrior, Suriv, Mel, SC, and Infa. As well as
  to anyone who felt they should have been on this list but for some odd
  reason, I, like a dumbass, forgot to put there!
