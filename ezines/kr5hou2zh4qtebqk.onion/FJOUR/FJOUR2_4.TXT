The Bill of Rights 1990 Edition
--

	As they say, the Constitution is a living, breathing document,
which changes with time.  Let's see how the government interprets our
Bill of Rights today.

Amendment I
	Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of
religion unless the majority is a part of that religion, or prohibiting
the free exercise thereof, unless that would include an action which
society considers immoral; or abridging the freedom of speech, unless
enough money does not exist to pay for lawyers; or of the press, unless
the opinion expressed is contrary to that of the government, or the
right of the people peaceably to assemble, unless they don't have
enough money to pay for a permit, and to petition the Government for a
redress of grievances and be put on a list of subversive people.

Amendment II
	A well-regulated militia, being dangerous to those in power,
the right of the people, unless they lack enough money and political
influence, to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed.

Amendment III
	No soldier shall, in time of peace be quartered in any house
without the consent of the owner, taken by any means, nor in time of
war, but in a manner prescribed by law.

Amendment IV
	The right of the people, unless a minority, disliked by the
police, too poor to pay for lawyers, or lacking friends in high places,
to be secure in their persons, houses, and effects, against
unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated, but upon the
suspicion of a police officer or the word of an anonymous or paid
informant, and vaguely describing the place to be searched, and the
persons or things to be seized.

Amendment V
	No person, unless a minority, disliked by the police, too poor
to pay for lawyers, or lacking influential friends, shall be held to
answer for a capital, or otherwise infamous crime, unless on
presentment or indictment of a Grand Jury, except in cases arising in
the land or naval forces, or in the militia, when in actual service in
time of war or public danger; nor shall any person, unless a minority,
a dissident, or disliked by the authorities, be subject for the same
offense to be twice put in jeopardy of life or limb; no shall be
compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself, not be
deprived of life, liberty, or property, without the suspicion of a
police officer or anonymous informant; nor shall private property be
taken for public use without just compensation unless the owner is too
poor to pay for lawyers to get it back.

Amendment VI
	In a few criminal prosecution, except those where the accused
is a minority, disliked by the police, or poor, the accused shall enjoy
the right to a speedy and public trial, by an jury of slaves to State,
in any district, and to be kept ignorant of the nature and cause of the
accusation, unless the police feels predisposed to inform; to not know
the witnesses against him; to have compulsory process for obtaining
witnesses in his favor,  unless he can't afford to pay them, and to
have the assistance of bad counsel for his defense.

Amendment VII
	In suits at common law, where the value in controversy shall
exceed twenty dollars, the right of trial by jury shall be preserved,
unless the person lacks the education to be informed of this right, and
any fact tried by a jury may be reexamined in any court of the United
States.

Amendment VIII
	Excessive bail shall not be required, nor excessive fines
imposed, nor cruel and unusual punishments inflicted, unless the
accused is a minority, poor, or without influence.

Amendment IX
	The enumeration in the Constitution, of certain rights, shall
not be construed to grant these rights unconditionally.  They may be
taken at any time.

Amendment X
	The powers not delegated to the United States by the
Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the states, are reserved to the
Federal government, and to no one else.

General Stuff

	Thoughts of a renegade firefighter as he neared the Oakland
fire of 1991:
	RAs my speeding motorcycle slid underneath the greasy black
cloud underneath the east end of the Bay Bridge, the early afternoon
sun became an orange orb.  A voice inside my helmet asked if this was
what it was like to descend into hell.  Instantly another voice
replied, TNo, no one will be shooting at you.U  There was a comfort
knowing that nature is a much less efficiently deadly foe than man.S
						-- Tom Ness
						
RThe Bible speaks of the postwar conversion of swords into plowshares. 
If the metallic plowshares had been produced in the first place,
sufficient food production for everybody would have been possible. 
Lack of food and other life support brought about the fighting to begin
with.  Those suggesting production of metal plowshares before the war
were always given the brush-off by tribal or state leaders and told,
TMetal plowshares are far too expensive.  We shall make do with wooden
ones.U  In the long view, however, heroic expenditures for basic
life-support needs make good economic sense.S

					--R. Buckminster Fuller
					Cosmography

	In the name of obeying the law, the Parent CATS newsletter is
advocating a very dangerous practice.  The newsletter warns of parties
at which the parents are home and alcohol is served.  These parties are
responsible in that people must turn in their keys at the door. 
However, the newsletter urges that parents disallow their children from
attending these parties.  If this is done, then the result will be
students drinking alcohol in much less safe environments, and driving.
	In addition, the newsletter claims that the parents should set
an example.  The only example a parent can set is to not drink alcohol
himself.  A parent telling a teenager not to drink alcohol just because
he is under a certain age limit while the parent drinks himself is
sheer discrimination.
	When a law is wrong, it must be defeated.  Respect for values
should be fostered, not for illogical laws.  A drinking age is mere age
discrimination.  The government can afford to discriminate because
young people do not actively fight for their rights.  If the people
fight for their rights, freedom will be gained.

Strength in Groups
--
	I have decided to start a group of people who are devoted to
the cause of preserving freedom in this country.  In order to start
this group, I am looking for some people who are willing to help.
	I am looking for an assistant who will help me run the group. 
This person needs only to have a strong wish to preserve the nation's
freedom.
	I am including the mission statement for the group.  Please
offer any suggestions. Meetings will be held at Cook Memorial Library. 
This will provide the symbolic idea that we hold information in high
esteem.  If you are interesting in joining the group, please contact
me.  Informationon a date and time is forthcoming.  Thank you.

|	The Partnership for a Free America
|	Mission Statement

	The Partnership for a Free America has been established to
protect the fundamental rights of the people of the United State of
America.  Currently, the government has been rapidly removing the civil
liberties of the people in this country.  This trend must be stopped
before all is lost.
	Society is taking a trend which leads to more governmental
influence in the personal lives of the people.  This influence,
although at times may be good, often leads to violations of the
people's fundamental freedoms.
	These freedoms are the basis of this country's prosperity.  In
a free society there is generally more prosperity.  In most societies
in which the people are hampered by control, there is generally less
prosperity.  Thus, freedom must not be ignored during times of economic
hardship.
	In order to effect these goals, the following actions will be
taken.

1)	Educate people about the actions which the government is taking
towards the destruction of the rights in the country.  Expose that
which this nation's leaders have been doing to speed the trend towards
more governmental control.
2)	Put an end to the major excuse the government has for violating
these rights.  The War on Rights, called by some the War on Drugs,
provides an excuse for unreasonable search and seizure, racist
policies, and suppression of information.  The suppression of
information will be countered by providing information which is being
suppressed.
3)	Create a support for those who have had their rights violated. 
A person with support from others will be able to fight for his or her
rights much more effectively, and thus these rights will be protected. 
In addition, when the people are divided, it is much easier for the
government to take away their rights.  
4)	Fight for civil liberties in the high school itself.  The
Partnership will demand due process, the right to privacy, and other
such rights as outlined in the Constitution.
	Thus, the Partnership for a Free America has been established
to protect the rights in this country.  The preceding actions will
provide a strong basis for that protection, as well as a general
refusal to let one's rights be violated.

Just Say No
--
	If someone comes up to you and offers to analyze your urine,
just say no.
	RThe right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses,
papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall
not be violated. . .S
					-- The United States Constitution
	There is a growing trend in society towards a more police state
atmosphere in this country, as regular readers of The Free JournalJhave
seen.  Drug testing is another step the country is taking which is
making it more like Orwell's 1984.
	The most striking indictment of urine testing is the inaccuracy
and trust which people have in the test.  The urine tests which are in
wide usage have at best a 5 percent error rate.  (This means if one
thousand clean people are tested, fifty innocent people will be blamed,
and possibly fired from their jobs.)  However, this error rate is an
optimistic number.  Most testing facilities do not take the proper
precautions such as cleaning the equipment properly or sufficient
organization of the specimens when testing the urine, and thus the
error rate may be increased to about thirty percent.  This error would
not be as great a problem if people recognized the error, and verified
results with more than one test.  However, this is not done, and
companies fire people with one false positive result on a test.
	In addition to being inaccurate, the tests infringe on a
person's privacy.  A person's employer has no right to determine what
the employee does off the job as long as it does not impair the
employee's performance.  These tests have been used to fire people who
are epileptic, although the epilepsy created no impairment on the job. 
The tests will determine if a person is taking psychiatric drugs, and
thus the employer may fear an RunstableS worker and fire him for using
these legal prescription drugs while not at work.
	Urine tests do not check if a person is impaired so that he may
not be able to do his job correctly.  A person may be fatigued and not
concentrating.  This person is more impaired than someone who smoked a
joint a week ago.  Tests exist called impairment tests which see if a
person is too fatigued to do his job properly.  This only tests the
person's ability to concentrate while at work.
	There are ways to fight this.  One way if to simply refuse to
be tested.  If enough people refuse to test, the company can simply not
afford to fire the entire workforce.  Thus, if testing appears eminent
at your workplace, convince other employees to refuse the test.
	If you were unable to convince others to refuse and do not wish
to lose your job, there are ways of defeating the test.  The night
before the test, drink as much water as possible.  This will dilute the
urine.  Piss at least once in the morning before the test because the
first urination of the day is the dirtiest.  Drink even more water.
	If you have good concealment skills, you may be able to replace
your urine with RcleanS urine.  You can buy powdered clean urine from
Byrd Laboratories, 225 Congress #340, Austin, Texas 78701,
(512)-480-0085.  Just add water, for experimental purposes only.  Only
$24.95 for clean urine powder.  The urine is pre-checked so that it
will come up negative on the tests.  Be sure the urine you replace is
warm, from 90 to 98 degrees Fahrenheit.  To conceal the urine and
replace it, purchase a Bard Dispoz-a-Bag( or similar product.  Fill
with clean urine and tie around your abdomen.  Snake the output tube to
your crotch.  Then when it is time to urinate, discreetly release the
cap on the bag, and the urine will empty out of the tube into the jar. 
Other methods exist.  Get the book Steal this Urine TestJby Abbie
Hoffman for more information.  (Available from Cook Memorial and the
College of Lake County Libraries.)
	If you are unable to conceal urine, or have no warning, you can
say you have used certain over-the-counter drugs which are
cross-reactive with the politically incorrect drugs the tests look for.
 There is usually a place on the form to fill such things out.  For
amphetamines, you can put down Nyquil or Sudafed.  For marijuana, you
can put down any ibuprofen drug, such as Advil or Motrin.
	More information is available from Abbie's book.

Guilty Until Proven Innocent
--
	Your community group has just held a successful bingo game,
where the income for the day was in the thousands of dollars.  You are
driving to the bank to deposit the income when a police officer pulls
you over.  He claims that you look suspicious.
	The officer searches your trunk, and find the money from the
bingo game.  He waves the money and says that no honest person would
carry that much cash.  You must be a drug dealer.  The money is taken,
and you are given a receipt specifying only Ran unspecified amount of
cash.S  Despite all efforts to get it back, you can't.
	You are sleeping peacefully in your home when intruders break
in.  Due to your groggy state, you do not recognize the intruders and
try to defend your home.  You are unarmed.  You are shot and killed. 
The police had suspected that you had firearms in your house because of
an informant.  There were no firearms.
	You arrive at O'Hare International Airport.  An agent has a
suspicion that you are a drug dealer and you are subject to a strip
search, including rectal examination.  Your money is sniffed by a dog,
and the dog wagged its tail.  It is seized.  (96 percent of United
States currency is contaminated with cocaine.)
	You are on vacation when the police pull you over.  They search
your car and find a white stick of bubble gum.  They claim that it is
cocaine, bring you and your kids into the station, and seize $2,300 in
cash.
	This is the War on Drugs.  In 80 percent of all cases where
property was seized, no charges were filed.  Innocence is no protection
from losing your property or life.
