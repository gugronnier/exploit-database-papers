The title of this article is that of communications technology. Not data
communications or telephony but communications. The two have for all
practical purposes become one in the same. Voice communications, wireless
communication services etc. are now being transmitted by digital means. What
was once a simple matter of drawing a line between the two is no more the
case. 

This convergence together with new technologies radically changes the picture
of communications. Many former concepts and systems will be obsolete in a few
years. 

To examine the future of communications i'll cover:

- ISDN and BISDN
- ATM
- SONET
- Service Net-2000 
- Other developments 

ISDN
=--=

A comprehensive description of ISDN would be to big to cram in here so a
brief definition and update on the status of ISDN will be given. 

ISDN Defined
------------
ISDN is defined by the CCITT as:

...a network in general evolving from a telephony Integrated Digital Network
(IDN), that provides end-to-end digital connectivity to support a wide range
of services including voice and non-voice services, to which users have
access by a limited set of standard multi-purpose user network interfaces...

Basically ISDN is a network that carries voice and data over the same lines.
All services exist in digital form and can be switched by one network. Much
has been forecasted about how ISDN will change the world with interactive
television, home banking, employees conducting business at home, new services
etc. with AI systems controlling central databases. 

Technically defined it provides a digital interface, usually with 2 channel
types - B channels for voice and data and D channels for signalling and
control. This gives a dedicated channel for the subscribers information and
one for control of the interface. 

The fundamental building block of ISDN is its 64 kbps digital channels. With
two main interfaces - Basic Rate Interface (BRI) and Primary Rate Interface
(PRI). BRI handles small scale services such as subscriber lines and PRI
handles large scale services such as central databases. Each has both a D
channel and X number of B channels. BRI has 2B + D channels and PRI has 23B
+ D channels. Each B channel is 64 kbps and the D channel is 64 kbps for the 
PRI and 16 kbps for the BRI. To plan for future increases 384 kbps has been
allotted to the H0 channel, 1336 kbps to the H11 channel and 1920 kbps to the
H12 channel.

Integration
-----------
ISDN will have one format, so various devices won't need their own dedicated
lines. One common interface will accommodate all applications. By having one
set of wires and protocols users won't need to bother with coaxial cables for
television, X.25 protocols for packet switched networks (PSNs), telex lines,
various leased lines etc. 

Misconceptions
--------------
ISDN itself isn't going to provide anything. It is just the standard for
network interface. Anything new will depend upon the services offered on it.
The concept of digital switching is not a new one to begin with. Its been in
use since the mid 60's. The real "upheaval" with ISDN is that Ma Bell is no
longer going to provide just telephone calls but a whole range of services.
This list of services along with speed requirements and channel type was
taken from the IEEE.

Service                   Speed Required      Channel
-------                   --------------      -------
Voice                     8,16,32,64 kbps     B
Alarms                    10-100 bps          D
 Smoke

Interactive information   4.8-64 kbps         B
 Electronic banking  
 Electronic yellow pages
 Opinion polling
High quality audio        ~300-700 kbps    
Slow scan TV              56-64 kbps          B
Compressed video          ~30 Mbps
Compressed video conf.    ~1.5 Mbps
Broadcast video           ~100 Mbps
Switched video            ~100 Mbps
Interactive video         ~100 Mbps
Facsimile graphics        4.8-64 kbps         B
 
CCS
---
Another vital part of ISDN is Common Channel Signalling (CCS). Which
separates signalling information from user data. Rather than being an older
form of in-band signalling where signals and data are on the same channel it
is out of band, where signals travel on different channels. This allows more
services and reduces circuit connection times. ISDN uses SS no.7 (SS7). The
initial version SS6 used analog trunks of 2400 bps, SS7 uses digital trunks
of 56/64 kbps.
Well, you've most likely asking yourself what this all means for our
underground activities. It will create a bonanza of new services and
opportunities all unified in one network. Just as data and voice
communications are merging so to will hacking, phreaking, cable fraud etc.
Because ISDN has yet to be implemented on a mass scale in North America its
not possible to say specifically how it may be abused. You should still be
prepared for its arrival by understanding its design and purpose though. 

Many supplementary services have been approved for ISDN by the CCITT and more
are being approved right now: 

Number Identification Services:
- Direct Dialing In (DDI)
- Multiple Subscriber Number (MSN) - Allows different numbers to ring at one 
  number.
- Calling Line Identification Presentation (CLIP) - (ANI)
- Calling Line Identification Restriction (CLIR) - blocks out an incoming   
  ISDN number. 
- Connected Line Identification Presentation (CLOP)
- Connected Line Identification Restriction (COLR)
- Malicious Call Identification and Sub-Addressing (not yet defined by the  
  CCITT).

Call Offering Services:
- Call Transfer - Lets a call be transferred to a third party.
- Call Forwarding Busy (CFB)
- Call Forwarding No Reply (CFNR)
- Call Forwarding Unconditional (CFU)
- Call Deflection

Misc. Services:
- Private Numbering Plan
- Advice of Charge - Allows the caller to find out the cost of a call before, 
  during or after.
- Credit Card Calling and Reverse Charging
- User-to-User Signalling (UUS) 

These supplementary services take advantage of SS7's full range of
capabilites. 

ISDN Trials
-----------
Since ISDN provides the "digital pipe" and the subscriber selects services;
the network, circuits, trunks and customer premises equipment (CPE) are all
being tested. Most of the early ISDN trials were quite basic and were
intended only to prove the validity of ISDN concepts. The current status of
ISDN is with more complex testing and actual implementations. A brief summary
follows.

Broadband ISDN (BISDN)
----------------------
Is designed to exploit ISDN's full broadband capabilities. With BISDN
everything from alarm monitoring to live action video broadcasts can be
handled. BISDN is designed to use optical transmissions and compress its data
up to 15 times by using more sophisticated terminal equipment. Thus BISDN can
handle video images which require refreshing 30 times a second and would
require transfer rates of 100 Mbps with no compression. Because of its
complexity BISDN will likely end up in commercial applications in the near
future.

Transfer Modes
--------------
In the design of BISDN standards either the synchronous transfer mode (STM)
or the asynchronous transfer mode (ATM) can be used. STM is the POTS way
using time division multiplexing. Synchronous multiplexing uses a clock to
assign windows for information to be transmitted, regardless of wether
transmission takes place at all. Asynchronous multiplexing does without a
clock to keep transmissions in place. ATM is virtually the same as this, with
faster routines. In ATM windows for transmission are opened when needed and
are not arbitrarily assigned. Information indicating the source is in each
header. ATM is the more common method being CCITT approved. STM is still
being debated as the use of highly accurate atomic clocks will ease
multiplexing digital bit streams coming from multiple locations. 

ATM
=--

Is a method of cell oriented switching and multiplexing giving high-speed,
low error transmissions. Which combines the efficiency of packet technology
with the reliability of circuit switching. It is made up of fixed, 53
character cells. Every cell has 48 characters and a 5 character header to
keep track of its source. Incoming data is broken up into smaller uniform
cells by ATM equipment, transmitted and reassembled upon reception. 

Since processing fixed sized cells is such a basic task, ATM is much faster
at packet switching than say X.25 is. Giving ATM the ability to deal with
such demanding applications as real-time video. ATM switches and transmits
all forms of communications - voice, data, narrow and broadband, continuous
and two-way dialogue traffic, in this uniform fashion. ATM transmits its data
over a "virtual channel" when in connectionless mode. A virtual channel is
the channel that connects points on the ATM network. A virtual connection
moves a set of virtual channels with the same path identifier over the
network. It has a cell header that consists of a virtual path and virtual
channel identifier. To allow private networks, crossconnects or virtual path
switches create a permanent link or virtual path between both ends of the
network. Virtual path switches don't need signalling as ATM switches do. 

The adoption of a global ATM network will be at the earliest in 1995. Trials
with ATM are already underway. The move toward BISDN will require the
development of both this ATM network and crossconnects. 

SONET
=--=- 

The Synchronous Optical Network (SONET) is the ANSI standard for the
transmission of ATM frames on optical fiber networks. SONET vastly increases
potential transmission rates. It far surpasses today's DS3 speed and has an
OC-1 bandwith of 51.84 Mb/s. OC-48 is 2.5 Gb/s, the commercial version will
be much slower at OC-3 or 155 Mb/s. 

In addition to providing greater data transfer rates it is a far more
intelligent network, transmitting control directives in its synchronous
stream. The subscriber's data is contained in the payload and the control
directives in the overhead. Overhead is made up of its section, line and path
components. Users can manipulate the network with messages placed in
overhead. The section overhead covers frame and error monitoring and controls
key equipment on the transmission line such as optical regenerators. Line
overhead monitors performance. Path overhead monitors errors and controls the
signalling between different points on the SONET network. SONET's synchronous
bit streams give very reliable transmissions and multiplexing. 

SONET more or less integrates the functions of OA&M and as a result fewer
systems will be needed to perform them. What this means is fewer access ports
will be available to dial into. 

SONET (and for that matter ISDN, BISDN, SS7 and ATM) are more complicated and
have a lot more to them than what's been presented here. Look for specialized
files on them and what they can do for you in upcoming journals. 

Service Net-2000
=--=--=--=--=--=

Service Net-2000 is designed to use the capabilites of the 5ESS Switch to
provide a better public switched telephone network (PSTN). Improvements that
are required by the advent of more technically demanding services such as
HDTV, high speed data transmissions, speech recognition etc. These services
require faster and faster communications and higher bandwiths. Service
Net-2000, is designed to provide higher capacity switching and data networks
using SONET technology. The goal being to provide an effective universal
information service (UIS). In this Service Net-2000 is a kind of "follow up"
to ISDN.

Architecture
------------
SS7 is at the heard of this intelligent network. It provides 64 kb/s voice
transmissions and 1.54 mb/s (T1) data transmissions, when over fiber optic or
other high bandwith lines.

The need for Service Net-2000 is high, once you consider the oncoming rush of
optical transmissions measured in rates of gigabits/second. Nodes in Service
Net-2000 are also "intelligent" being "self-aware", adapting to net changes,
making corrections and self improving.  

The main goal to Service Net-2000 architecture is to provide unification. It
combines basic functions such as switching, routing etc. with data
transmissions just as ISDN does. The end result being a decentralized CO
throughout the system. As individual functions disappear and are replaced by
this integrated system.

Service Node
------------
This integration is performed by the service node. Based on the 5ESS-2000
system (note that 5ESS is now 5ESS-2000 when used with Service Net-2000 and
broadband network services-2000 (BNS2000))

The "2000" group that forms this is based on SONET. Using flexible mapping
and frame switching rates at multiples of 51.84 mb/s are supported. The
"2000" group consists of the:

- Digital data multiplexer (DDM-2000)
- Digital access and cross-connect systems IV-2000 (DACS IV-2000)
- DACS III-2000 cross connect system
- DACScan-2000 controllers
- DACScan-2000 workstation
- FT-2000 lightware

The DACS IV-2000 is able to carry higher speed virtual tributary (VT)
channels and not just today's, slower asynchronous ones. Both DACS IV-2000
and DACS III-2000 can support non-SONET hookups too, making them quite
versatile. The DACS III-2000 differs from the IV-2000 in offering the
DS3/Synchronous Transmission Signal-1 (STS-1)

5ESS-2000
---------
As I mentioned before 5ESS-2000 combines BNS-2000 with the other members of
the "2000" group. This boosts the capacity of a 5ESS-2000 Switch to 250,000
lines on 64,000 trunks. Key to this is the improved switching module, the
SM-2000. It handles everything associated with a call and can even be used as
a stand alone remote office, in which case it's called a EXM-2000.

To enable high-speed interfaces, 5ESS-2000 uses digital networking units
(DNUs). All a DNU is, is a combination of a 5ESS Switch with say a DACS
switch. The DNU-IV is a derivative of the DACS IV-2000 and gives additional
high speed possibilities. Due to its high operating speed it can greatly
speed up CO operations that are slowed down by older copper wirings.

With the DNS-2000 cell switch, the broadband integrated services digital
network (BISDN) will be created. Point-to-point packet frame relays can be
provided even to those lacking T-1s. As well as offering switched
multimegabit data services (SMDS) with up to T3 capabilities. The cell switch
is made up of low speed port carriers running at 8 mb/s and high-speed
switching systems running in excess of 200 mb/s. BNS-2000 handles both frame
relays that require connections and SMDSs which don't. 

Service Net-2000 has the ability to redirect calls between different areas
effortlessly. The service control point (SCP) provides the information for
the service circuit node based on call screening options, the date/time etc.
Allowing the 5ESS-2000 switch to offer a whole range of options such as call
waiting, forwarding, blocking etc. 

Basically the idea behind Service Net-2000 is to add intelligence to the 5ESS
switching system and to drastically improve its speed and call handling
abilities. With the purpose of creating a more powerful UIS.

Other Developments
=--=--=--=--=--=--

Intelligent Network (IN)
------------------------
IN is just distributing AI throughout the network. A trend which pops up
numerous times throughout this issue of the journal with Expert Systems,
Service-Net 2000 etc. The idea behind IN is to have large and fast central
databases connected with the rest of the network with protocols such as X.25,
SS7 etc. IN allows global service to be introduced easier with good
flexibility. 

IN is comprised of service switching points (SSPs) and service control points
(SCPs). SSP takes calls and sends them to an SCP. SCPs contain the databases
themselves such as calling card verification data. 

Telecommunication Management Network (TMN)
------------------------------------------
TMN as the name implies manages the network. TMN performs OA&M on a CCITT
standardized structure. 

Gigabit Testbeds
----------------
Are now being implemented for experimental purposes by DARPA, NSF and others.
Several are being conducted by the Corporation for National Research
Initiatives (NRI). They involve telcos, academic, commercial and government
researchers for the future National Research and Education Network (NREN)
Internet. NREN promises a good deal of services, such as real-time
transmission of high-speed data streams, huge automated electronic libraries
and Gb/s transmission rates taking us away from ascii into full motion video.

One experimental net is Vistanet with ATM and SONET capabilities and 622 Mb/s
speed. Another one is Aurora. Bellcore is providing an experimental Sunshine
switch and IBM a Planet Packet Transfer Mode (PTM). Unlike ATM, PTM packets
have no fixed size being as large as 2k. PTM is not a recognized standard but
may end up in commercial use, with ATM serving the network itself from the
CO. 

NT is providing a SONET Digital Multiplex System (S/DMS) that takes up to 16
SONET inputs of 155 Mb/s and multiplexes them to 2.4 Gb/s for Casa a co-
operative venture of several organizations in California. The main component
of Casa is a high-performance parallel interface (Hippi) gateway for SONET. 

A European group called RACE (R&D in advanced communications technologies in
Europe) is designing Integrated Broadband Communications (IBC) within a
BISDN. RACE is also working on Code-Division Multiple Access (CDMA), optical
networks, teleshopping, electronic funds transfer over a ATM BISDN, mobile
network architecture and the universal mobile telecommunications system
(UMTS).

The Future
----------
Compared to the last century of relatively stagnant copper wiring the impact
of higher bandwiths and optical technologies will - eventually - be
monumental. All of this does however depend on the introduction of optical
fibers. Because of the narrow-band copper wires that are the last link to the
subscriber, evolution to better technology is stunted (in the US at least).
The cost of overhauling these copper wires in the US with fiber ones is on
the order of 200 billion US. In other nations however, the use of fibers
linking residential homes is more than 50%. Fiber technology is however,
constantly growing and its price dropping. 

As an aside to all this, look at what's been done in the last 10 years of
communications compared to the last 100 years. We are constantly lessening
the doubling time of communications technology. In the next 3 years we will
equal the last 10 years of progress. Soon it will drop down to a year and
then to a matter of months. Since International standards take 15 + years to
work out bureaucracy may become an impediment.
