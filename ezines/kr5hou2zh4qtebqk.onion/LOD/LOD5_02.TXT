                        TECHNICAL SCHOOL


Rather than just educating everyone informally in the ways of computer and
telephone security and understanding, the LOD has decided to go all the way
with it. No longer are we just a hacking group. The LOD is now offering
formal courses the way any other accredited Technical School, College of
Applied Arts or University does.

Several Reasons lay behind this bold new decision...

o  Educate people in skills that can be applied to today's job market.
o  Give a general understanding in computers/telecom.
o  Offer unique courses that other institutions don't offer. 
o  Instead of people wrongly claiming to be a "hacker" they can now become  
   one. 
o  Offer all those interested a chance to enrol.
o  And to provide them free of charge. 

Due to limited resources only the three courses we felt to be the most
important are being offered. They will be conducted on a "correspondence"
basis. It operates as follows. If you are seriously interested in enroling in
these courses, send us Email or snail mail with the completed application
form at the end of this calendar. That includes your name, address, phone
number, Internet address if applicable and a brief outline of your
educational and occupational background. Don't worry though all applicants
are accepted. We would however advise everyone that previous experience with
a computer is recommended. If sending snail mail be sure to provide a 8X11
size SASE for us to reply to you in. A course outline including a list of
required readings and assignment due dates will be mailed back to you. In the
outline will be full bibliographic information on the books and soft copy
materials you'll need for the course. It will work just like any other course
does just without the exams and tests as it would be impossible to adjudicate
them. However, because of this and to maintain the integrity of the LOD
Technical School papers will be marked sternly at post-secondary standards.
After you submit your paper to us an LOD member will mark it and return it to
you via snail or email with comments and a grade attached. 

Now for the best part... You can take these LOD courses as "Courses at
another institution". Meaning that yes, in addition to getting your degree,
included in it can be LOD courses! ALL educational institutions have
provisions for courses to be taken at other institutions. Its a fairly simple
procedure.  You go to your Office of Student Programmes/department/guidance
centre etc. and obtain a form for "taking a course at another institution". 
Attach the course descriptions from this file and gain permission from the
director of your faculty/department/program/etc. and then you are set.
Providing you pass our courses with a high enough grade your institution will
accept the courses as part of your degree requirements. If your institution
has no equivalent courses, they can become "electives". Since you are usually
required to take up to 3 elective courses to obtain a degree why not do
something you enjoy? After all its more exciting than taking Early Italian
Literature as your elective. There is no need to worry about our "legitimacy"
as long as you obtain permission to take the course through the proper
procedure. An institution does not need any kind of formal designation though
the Department/Ministry of Education to provide a course. We are just another
one of the millions of institutions throughout the world that offer training
or formal courses. These courses can also be used to place you in "Advanced
Standing" if you aren't at school now but decide to in the future. Or just
for the sake of expanding your horizons/mind/abilities etc.

Because we have no set semester schedule, courses start at the first of every
month and run for five months. Starting 1 November 1993. Take them at your
own convenience. A maximum of one course may be taken at a time. 

Here are the descriptions to the first 3 LOD Technical School Courses: (Full
outlines will accompany your enrolment starting 1 November 1993)


------------CUT HERE---------------------------------------------------------

TEL3440 0.5 Credits  Telephony
With the rise of sophisticated technology telephony is becoming much more
complex. The entire telephone network from customer premises equipment to
switching systems will be covered. Recent trends such as ISDN, BISDN, fiber
optics and data networking will also be studied. 

CSC3450 0.5 Credits  Computer Security
With the rise of computers, securing them against criminal or malicious use
has become vital. Surprisingly little attention has been devoted to it
leaving many systems wide open to abuse. Covered in this course will be the
security of LANs, networks and various operating systems. Cryptology will be
examined as well. 

HCK4100 0.5 Credits  Intro to Hacking
Despite all the attention hackers have received, there is only a small core
of no more than a few hundred people in the world that have the skills to
actually hack. Starting with the basics of hacking it will guide you into
more advanced intrusion techniques with the more popular operating systems.
This course may be taken based on your own abilities, so master hacker or
just plain novice it will fit you. PSNs, Internets, basic hacking on popular
operating systems such as unix and vax will be covered along with other
operating systems and nets depending on your time/prior abilities.

Career Opportunities

After passing our courses you will be able to supplement your job skills for
finding employment in any sector of the economy - Business, Industry or
Government that deals with computers/telecom.

Remember these are FREE courses. They have a retail value of around US $1,250
each if taken at a high-quality University in the US. Take advantage of this
opportunity to learn something you enjoy doing for FREE. The Legion of Doom
believes in disseminating knowledge so is offering these courses as a public
service to the world. Finally they are well worth your time. They are done in
highly organized with carefully selected readings and assignments. It would
take years of self-study to achieve what you can with these courses in just
a few months. And because we don't spout out loads of useless and academic
theory, math and equations like most institutions you'll learn far more here.

Since these are "correspondence" courses you must have a high degree of self-
discipline and motivation. If you lack these qualities don't waste your time
or ours by attempting them. They will take at least several hours of week on
your part, so if you can't put aside such time don't bother with them. 

If you would like to take these courses send the enclosed application form
(either in email or snail mail) to the Legion of Doom Technical School at:
