One of the goals behind phreaking has always been to delve into the deepest
fathoms of the phone system. Since the barriers of expensive international
calling are meaningless to the phreak, the exploration of various telephone
systems is possible.

This file will investigate some of the switching systems you are likely to
encounter around the world. In other words non-ESS/DMS using nations outside
the United States. Nothing has ever been said about these systems in "the
underground" and what little information that exists publicly is skimpy, hard
to find, badly translated or not translated at all and very outdated. 

The foundation of any telephone network is in its switching system so a whole
new universe of different switching systems is out there waiting for you. ESS
does get boring after a while and there is nothing really novel about if,
after all nearly everyone lives under it and there isn't that much to
discover about it. So branch out internationally to seek new telephone
networks and boldly go where no phreak has gone before!

I won't spoil the thrill of hearing new tones and discovering new things by
giving out all the juicy things you're liable to find, instead this is going
to be a broad based overview of 7 switching systems:

Sweden - AXE 10
France - E 12
United Kingdom - DSS
Netherlands - PRX-D
Germany - EWS-D
Italy - PROETEO
Japan - NEAX 61
 
There are far more than just these systems out there as shown by this chart

Sweden - AXE-10 (+46)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Swedish AXE 10, was developed by Ericsson and in addition to being found
in Sweden itself is also being used by over 30 countries. 

AXE 10 performs most of the basic functions of international switching, local
tandems and offices, national transit etc. It covers everywhere from isolated
rural areas with only a few hundred subscribers all the way up to huge
transit exchanges of a million subscribers.

AXE 10 has 3 main susbsystems:
SSS - Subscriber and group (GSS) switching
TSS - Trunk signalling and (TCS) traffic control
CHS - Charging, OMS and Maintenance

Other optional subsystems are:
SUS - Subscriber faciltites (OPS) operator functions
MTS - Mobile subscriber functions

Functions that share the same purpose are allotted to one subsystem. A
function block is a group of similar functions within the subsystem. For
example the subsystem SSS has a function block called the time switch (TS). 

Hardware

AXE 10 is a digital switching system. Interconnections between subsystems are
called "internal digital trunks". To give an example of AXE 10's hardware
consider the SSS subsystem.

SSS is divided up into lots containing up to 2048 subscribers, up to 128 of
these subscribers will then form a line switch module (LSM). Each subscriber
has an individual line circuit (LIC) connecting them to the LSM. The LSMs
themselves are interconnected by a TS bus (TSB). Each module has a TS that
performs switching for the subscriber the TSB and a junctor terminal circuit
(JTC).

Traffic within subsystems is handled by internal diagnostic links. If the LSM
lacks an internal digital link the call is carried by a TSB to another
module. Because SSS uses TSS and TSBs the network runs smoothly as a balance
is kept between the subscriber nodes and the internal digital links in use. 

Subscriber information can be kept either centrally or remotely. TS 16 in a
PCM is used to control a remote exchange. If the SSS is remotely located an
exchange terminal circuit (ETC) is used. The PCM will then signal between the
remote SSS and the ETC. The signalling is controlled by a signalling terminal
(ST) on the SSS and ETC ends of the circuit. 

The trunk signalling system (TSS) interfaces external signals into the AXE 10
signalling scheme.

One of the benefits to AXE is that any signalling scheme can be interfaced
without impacting on other subsystems. Thus AXE is highly adaptable to
network conditions.

In cases where analogue lines are connected by either incoming trunk (IT) and
outgoing trunk (OT) circuits conversion to digital takes place. Tone
signalling is conducted by code receivers (CRD) or code senders (CSD). 

France - E 12 (+47)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

CIT-Alcatel and Telic (CIT-ALCATEL) developed the E 12 system bases on the
earlier E 10 system to handle the functions of:

- international gateway
- inter-city transit
- medium to large urban area transit
- subscriber line switching

Capacity

The capacity of E 12 depends on call duration, signalling etc. The maximum
capacity is currently 1536 digital PCM systems of the 30 + 2 type equalling
over 40,000 circuits. Processing up to 110 calls a second. 

Architecture
E 12 is based on the architecture of its predecessor - E 10B. The three main
components are:

- subscriber and circuit connection units
- the central switching system and common control 
- computerized supervisory and maintenance centre (CTI) 

The CTI is the second control level supervises several exchanges and handles:

- line circuit management
- traffic load data logging
- maintenance and alarms
- billing

Three subassemblies allow speech transmission. The TST switching network, the
subscriber connection units (URA) and the circuit connection units (URM).

System Control
Is made up of three levels:

- a processing level in the line and circuit connection units, where
subscriber circuits are controlled
- central common switching control
- CTI

First Level Control
Is conducted by:

- 2 markers (MQ)
- 2 translators (TR)
- 2 incurred fee metering units (TX)
- 2-6 multiregisters

All of these units are related to a single switch and communicate on a bus
LM.  

MQ - interfaces common control to the central switch and subscriber and
circuit connection units
MR - receives and retransmits information and adjudicates the opening and
closing of connections.
TR - stores subscriber and circuit data
TX - free metering units
OC - control interface unit connects the CTI to other subassemblies.

Subscriber Connection Unit

Because traffic is concentrated on a small number of digital PCM systems, the
subscriber connection unit is needed to provide analog to digital
conversation. It also handles remote subscribers. The unit connects thousands
of lines to a central TS on PCM channels. 

Software

switching programs - perform loop status sensing, condition detection,
connection and disconnection, switch identification. maintenance subscriber
status memories etc.

monitoring programs - monitor the core of CSE, test and fault tracing
routines etc. 

All programs are written in Assembly. 

Functions
E 12 provides:

- CCS7
- traffic observation
- automatic fault tracing
- remote fault tracing
- service grade measurement
- operator assistance position
- automatic call back etc.

Organization
E 12 is organized into three areas:

- the switching network which handles signalling channels and
incoming/outgoing multiplexes
- the signalling units which handle channel allocation, CMF, CCS, DTF etc.
- a main SPC computer

All of which are connected to connection units (see the subscriber connection
unit). 

Programs
The main programs used are:

- program execution system, interfaces with the rest of the systems program
- exchange interface IOP (SEST)
- data interface IOP (SESI)
- signalling processor (SIG)
- common programs (PCO) for data
- call processor (TAP)

Service Management Unit (GES) does man/machine transactions, routing tables
and prefixes, signalling type allocations, traffic observation and logs
traffic data.

Fault Recovery System (DEF) will reconfigure after a detection of a system
failure, providing efficient recovery. 

Tracing and fault isolation (TED) will isolate a fault down to the PCB level
and carry out CRCs for fault prevention.

Digital Switching Subsystem (DSS) - United Kingdom (+44)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

DSS was created by the British Post Office (BPO) to serve as the nations
first digital switch. 

Subsystems
DSS uses specific hardware and software functions to interface subsystems.
The main DSS interfaces are located at the following subsystems:

- call processing system (CPS) 
- maintenance control subsystem (MCS)
- analogue line termination system (ALTS)
- network synchronization system (NSS)
- management statistics subsystem (MSS)

The main connecting interface in DSS is a 2048 kbit/s, 32 channel multiplex.
Which is used for example to connect the switchblock and auxiliary units. 

Trunking

DSS is capable of handling international switching centres of up to 20,000
erlangs and over 400 switch requests a second. To meet this the switch must
be multistage. The DSS switchblock has identical originating and terminating
circuits. A four-wire multiplex has a transit and receive pair on both ends
of the circuit. So information on the busy/free state of both is available
from one. 

To achieve spatial routing which is necessary for two channels to be
connected, DSS uses integrated circuit multiplexers (encoders).

DSS's time dividing in trunking allows single switches to carry large amounts
of traffic. The drawback to this is that should a fault occur on this switch,
thousands of calls could be disrupted. To ease this risk, synchronous
duplication of the TST setup with data comparison and parity checking is
done. 

Subsystem Functions

- digital line termination unit (DLT) interfaces the four-wire, 32 time-slot
2048 kbit/s multiplexers with the switchblock

- the TS transfers input time slots to output times slots

- space switch (SS) is an integrated circuit set for devices that connect
links with the trunk

- alarm monitor unit (AMU) - relieves the main cpu's load by handling alarm
data

- primary waveform generator (PWFG) is the clock with DSS is based on. By
sending 8 Khz tone start signals and 2048 Khz bit streams, operations are
directed

- local synchronization utility (LSU) uses incoming PCM links for timing and
maintains the frequency of its oscillators using phase locked loop techniques

- input/output buffer (IOB) stores messages from the software to the CLU

The Time Switch

Buffers the time reception with the time allocated from cross-office
switching with the space switch and the actual time of transmission. It also
does alarm interfacing between monitoring equipment and trunking. The TS is
composed of:

- speech stores (including DLT interfaces and store refining registers)
- control stores
- alarm interface unit (AIU) (including DLT and AMU interfaces)
- TS racks - a complete send and receive switch within DSS. The two TSs are
used in trunking are in 1 rack with 32 DLT units.
- space switch - a set of buffer and crosspoint units. Using the 2048 Khz
clock, the transmission of traffic is done on the TS interface buffer.

Hardware

The processor utility (PU) IOB is interfaced with the CCU by the PSS IOB. The
IOB communicates with the following:

- command field - ordering operations such as measure, trace, opening or the
removing of TSs.
- address fields - set network termination numbers (NTNs) that define TSs,
circuits etc.
- message identity field
- cross office slot field - makes sure that traces don't duplicate their
efforts by setting the points to start from during fault location. 

AMU

AMU handles DSS's specific functions such as the collection and persistence
checking of status info and diagnostic hardware. AMU interfaces to the PU and
thus advises the DSS maintenance software on fault areas. AMU receives time
and fault switchblock indicators from DLT using AIU in the TS. Persistence
checks are done to label the alarm as hard or transient. 

DLT

DLT conducts the line associated functions of monitoring, installation etc.
DLT also performs switch-related operations. Several are for simple backup
duplications of such functions as trunking and switch fault detections. 

DLT Related Functions

The line processor encodes or decodes HDB3 signals and recovers the received
clock. The clock is recovered by using a ringing circuit. The clock
synchronizes the switching centre by providing a network frequency reference.
DLT will identify remote alarm information if the distant alarm bit (usually
bit 3 in channel 0 of odd frames) shows a problem. DSS will, using AMU
instruct MCS to locate the fault. An alarm indications signal (AIS) shows a
transmission equipment failure by tossing out a load of "1s" in the frame. 

Line errors can be detected locally if HDB3 input goes or if synchronization
is off. If this occurs MCS is informed and DSS transmits a distant alarm unit
signal. 

Switch-related DLT functions are usually involved in duplicated trunking,
fault location or switching channel 0 spare-bits.

The most interesting function is fault location. DLT works with maintenance
software to locate and diagnose switchblock faults. By using path checks or
loop backs, results are sent via AIU to DLT.

Paths are tested using check patterns at both ends of a trunk. They can be
sent in and monitored on any channel after switching. Registers are used to
store the check patterns and they are controlled by the "central office". 

Or the DLT will "loop back" its transmit channels to the receive input of
trunking. Loop back is sometimes combined with a path check. By changing the
switch connections a closed loop can be implemented throughout the trunk.
Closed loops are very effective in determining hard faults from transient
ones.

Netherlands - PRX-D (+31)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Processor Controlled Exchange-Digital (PRX-D) builds upon the PRX system
with digital-time division multiplexing (TDM) and with other enhancements.
PRX-D was developed by Philips Telecommunication as an intelligent SPC
system. 

The three main areas of PRXs are:
- the switching network (SWN)
- central control complex (CCC)
- operator services (OPS)

Two different versions of trunk lines are used. An analog version - PRX-A has
six linked stages and reed-relay crosspoints of two or four wires or a
digital version of the TST type. Local or remote usage is possible by sending
traffic to the trunks. 

The CCC has two types of telecom processors (TCP) to deal with different size
exchanges. TCP 18 covers small-medium exchanges and TCP 36 medium-large
exchanges using multiprocessing with synchronized pairs. 

OPS is controlled by a mini-processor called TCP 7. OPS deals with OA&M and
AMA. 

Architecture

PRX-D is made of two layers:
- the main layer with the CCC, TCP XX and the control channel processor
terminals (CPT), connecting this layer to the control channel (CCH)
- another layer of SWN modules and the sub-channel controller (SCC)

The digital switching network (DSWN) passes voice and data traffic on 64
kbit/s, 32 channel PCMs. The PSWN has block terminals (TER) which interface
to other circuits and allow services and signals to be interconnected by a
digital trunk link network (DTN).

DTN

DTN is a one-way only transmission on a 4 wire connection. The highway-to-
group (HGD) and group-to-highway multiplexer (GHM) are 16 inlet ports in 4 X
4 groups. A highway switch (HWS) is a group of up to 128 X 128 highways whose
crosspoints can switch from one highway to the next under the control of a
highway switch address generator (HSA). A highway-to-group demultiplexer
(HGD) does the opposite of the GHM. 

A digital trunk-line block (DTB) carries a single highway and is controlled
by a DTB marker (DTM). DTN utilizes 7 varieties of customized low current-
mode logic (CCL) ICs.

CCL

The central clock (CCL) is made up of the synchronized mode clock generators
(CLG), the clock measuring unit (CMU) and sometimes a clock reference unit
(CRU). The DTN is sent timing information on 4096 Khz sine waves and 8 Khz
alignment pulses. 

Terminals

The 4 main TERs are:
- interfacing analog circuits (ACT)
- subscriber lines
- digital circuits (DLT)
- signalling and services (SST) 

- ACT has a peripheral module controller (AMC), a power supply unit (PSU) and
possibly a DTN interface board (DIB). The DIB performs the transmission of
timing signals and assigns time slots. 

- SST handles 2048 kbit/s groups by using DTN for signalling ie. MFC,
keytones etc. for services such as voice response systems.

Software

The operational program for TCP 18 is made up of: 
- master control program (MCP)
- call processing
- error management
- configuration management

The MCP handles the central control unit (CCU), I/O operations and other
misc. services. 

Communication between the main control unit (MCU) and the PMC is done by
transport handlers such as the digital trunk marker (DTM), analog circuit
terminal (ACT), digital circuit terminal (DCT) and the signalling and service
terminal (SST).

Call Handling

One part of the Telephony Operating System (TOS) is call processing modules.
Which distribute calls to an open CCU depending on network conditions. If a
secondary control unit (SCU) is available it will receive the calls. If
niether is available then the MCU will receive them. 

Error Maintenance

Error detecting hardware does diagnostics such as checking parity, comparing
timeout circuits etc. By using hardware to perform tests, checking is done
every time the hardware runs and processing time needn't be wasted running
testprograms. When the hardware equipment itself needs testing, testprograms
are then used.

Germany - EWS-D (+49)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Manufactured by Siemens Telecom, EWS-D is a complete digital switching
system, capable of serving from 200 lines to 60,000 trunks. 

Architecture

Subscriber line terminations and interchange trunks are used with trunk/line
groups (LTGs) where digital tone generators and digit receivers are located.
A TS performs connections inside of the LTG. Digital switching connects the
groups to a central processor (CP). Functions carried out by the CP include
overall switching, data storage and remote operation of the system. 

Here's a quick example of how a call would be processed under EWS-D:

- the group processor (GP) sense that the phone is off-hook and gives the
caller a tone generator and a digit receiver on the LTG using the group
switch (GS).
- the GP sends the service requested and the dialled digits to the CP. 
- CP checks the callers COS, locates a path and informs GP of the caller
- the callee's GP finishes the connection with its LTG, sends a ringing and
places the callee off-hook. 

LTG

Signals from an analog subscriber's line are converted into PCM signals on
the line circuit. Up to four interexchange trunk terminations comprise one
module. Four modules make up one highway and up to 128 interexchange trunks
can be on one LTG. A basic subscriber line circuit interfaces with any
signalling system. Notable functions of the subscriber line circuit are the
50/16 kHz call charge meters on the subscriber's premises, access circuitry
for testing and paystation signalling.

The PCM 30 transmission system has its synchronization, signalling channel
and alarm signal on one module. 2.048 Mbit/s highways are connected to the
GS. For a connection to the central network, 4 2.048's become one 8.192
Mbit/s signal. Because the network is duplicated, the identical modules can
easily be used for testing. 

Tones such as MFC frequencies are generated digitally on a LTG and sent to
the GS. One change here can effect the entire network. 
Central Switching Network

By using a central switching network up to 504 trunk groups, equivalent to
100,000 subscriber lines or 604 trunks can be attained. 8.192 Mbit/s
interfaces are used between the network and the LTG. As mentioned before the
entire network is duplicated. In case of a fault, the network will switch
over to its other half. 

Control and Common Signalling Channels

Control channels are grouped into units of 128 for distribution on the 8.192
Mbit/s network. The channels in time lot 0 are switched to the LTG only on
transmission links. Only half - 64 of 128 control channels are used. The
other half are for future uses. 

With SS7 the procedure for switching signalling channels though the LTG is
identical to that of the control channels. 

OA&M

Digital systems such as this have far fewer errors than analog SPC systems do
due to the smaller number of modules. EWS-D is expected to have fewer than 12
hardware faults per 1000 LTGs with less than 2 hours per fault. 

Both hardware and test programs are used to diagnose both subscriber line and
trunk faults. When testing is done on long distance trunks the equipment on
the distant exchange and on the transmission system is done. Measuring
equipment such as ATME2 look at the director and responder operations. Most
local trunks are still copper and EWSD has contacts on the incoming and
outgoing circuits for testing. The monitoring of PCM transmission links is
integrated into EWS-D. 

System status is given by an operating terminal indicating system traffic,
the failure/active status of redundant central units, LTGs and equipment
inside LTGs, the number of removed from active LTGs, subscriber lines and the
number of non-switchable call requests. Remote operations can be done via
this terminal. 

Administration tasks are also performed at the operating terminal. When a
remote operator is needed, communication equipment such as Transdata is used
to connect to the exchanges over the data transmission channel. 

Italy - PROTEO (+39)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

PROTEO was designed by Societa Italiana Telecomunicazioni SpA (SITS). 

Architecture

It is a fully integrated, digital switching system with SPC. Signals are
converted from analog to digital and transmitted over a PCM. Capacity is
30,000 subscribers in 32 peripheral exchanges (CTs) hooked up to a transit
network (RT) using 32, 2 channel PCMs. Overall control is by a central
computer (CC). A lone CT can handle 2,304 subscriber lines with 18 PCMs, 270
LF trunks and possess 2 line control units (UCL) on a connecting network
(RC). 

Subscribers and trunks are connected through a time division multiplex (TDM)
and can go directly to PAM without the analog to digital conversion using
voice scanners if need be. 

The CT, can act as a switch if internal subscribers are being switched to
RTs. CT is commonly connected to the RT for interconnections with external
switches. The CT has a codecom unit to convert analog to digital or digital
to analog for PCM bundle generation or insertion into PAM. A TST connection
network is inside the RT and is controlled by the CC using the transit
control unit (UCT). The RC switches 64 kbit/s data channels on 2 Mbit/s PCM
bundles towards UCS when exchange signalling exists and to UCM when remote
signalling comes in on a common channel. If CCS isn't present, then
signalling control units (UCS) are used to process signalling codes. 

Maintenance

CC uses LEONE processors in SPC for maintenance and has a BHCA capacity of
150,000. PROTEO handles rural areas quite well as CTs can be located at great
distances from the RT. If less than 250 subscribers exist, concentrators will
be used to connect them to a CT. 

Flexibility

The modularity of PROTEO is its ability to adapt to different network
conditions. By having functions act independently of others, upgrades and
maintenance is simplified. 

Japan - NEAX 61 (+81)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The NEAX 61 was designed by Nippon Electric Co. and was first installed in
the US. But due to its origin it is being included as a Japanese system. It
has SPC, PCM TDM and uses a four stage TSST switching network. 

Specifications

circuit capacity:
local switching - 100,000 lines, 13,000 trunks
toll switching - 60,000 trunks
international switching - 30,000 international circuits
network capacity - 22,000 erlangs
call handling capacity - 700,000 BHCA

Architecture

NEAX 61 is comprised of 4 subsystems:

- application subsystem - several service interface modules each having line
and trunk circuits, interface circuits, multiplexers and a controller. This
subsystem gives a standard interface to the other subsystems. It controls the
terminal circuits and interfaces them with the switching subsystem. Service
modules receive information from the processor to establish paths and other
actions. Each service module has a terminal and interface circuit, a
duplicated controller and primary multiplexer (PMUX) and demultiplexer. The
controllers collect terminal circuit scanning data, control the terminal and
interface circuits and communicate with the processor. The modules each have
their own terminal and interface circuits:

- analog trunk interface module - Both the terminal and interface circuits
are codecs. Any analog trunk can be used by the module and each trunk has its
own codec channel. 

- analog line interface module - The terminal circuit is an analog line
circuit that conducts two to four wire conversion, ringing application,
protects against overvoltage and other testing procedures. By using one of
four switch selectable balancing networks an insertion loss less than 0.5 dB
is possible. 

- digital line interface module - Connects PCM analog and digital subscriber
carrier lines. The interface circuit is a digital line switch that
concentrates digital lines by assigning time slots and putting each time slot
on a serial bit stream to the PMUX. 

- operator position interface module - connects the different operator
positions such as toll and directory assistance. Operators converse with
callers over position trunk circuits. The controller has a capacity of up to
64 operator positions and the PMUX can have up to 120 operators on a position
trunk. 

- processor subsystem

- Maintenance and Administration subsystem - Alarm information is shown on
the maintenance frame or at a supervisory test desk. The line test desk
platforms subscriber line testing. NEC has a technical assistance center
where NEC personnel provide support on a subscription basis.
