.Introduction

In order to maintain Northern Telecom's (NT) DMS-100 Digital Switch an 
advanced menu driven man-machine interface (MMI) is used. It is comprised of
a Visual Display Unit (VDU) which is part of the Maintenance and 
Administrative Position (MAP) interface. I'm going to outline how it deals
with maintenance, alarms, and administration. A quick example of how it
handles line and trunk trouble reports and the addition of a new subscriber
will be given.  

.Maintenance and Administrative Position (MAP)

Hardware
The MAP is the primary interface between the technician and the DMS-100
family of switches. The main hardware components of the MAP are:

1. Visual Display Unit (VDU) - the MAP terminal
2. Alarm Panel - sends an alarm to the VDU.
3. Communications Module - (telephone) to speak with the subscriber voice 
4. Test jacks 

.Remote MAP
Since all line and trunk test equipment is an integral part of the DMS-100,
no loss in accuracy results when the MAP is remote. Every switch has its own
dialup as well. Meaning this is not a theoretical file, you will be able to
dial up DMS-100 and perform switch maintenance!

Maintenance
A sophisticated MMI through the MAP terminal is used, to allow a technician
to maintain the switch and keep informed of switch operations. Maintenance of
a DMS-100 digital switch is made up of: 
1. Manually requested maintenance
2. Scheduled maintenance
3. Automatic maintenance after the detection of faults

Alarms
The system maintains alarms for the more critical areas of the switch, ie. 
the central controller. A real-time display of the alarms gives the
technician constant status reports.  

Administration
A Table Editor allows the technician to add new lines or trunks.  A Service
Order facility allows features such as hunt groups and Multiple Address
Directory Numbers (MADN) to be added. 

.Maintenance
A common use of line maintenance is in resolving a customer type trouble
report. The technician selects the Line Test Position (LTP) option and the
selected line is flagged for action by an identifier (ie.  directory number,
physical location number). The line status information, ie. line state and
terminating director number is constantly sent to the MAP terminal by
DMS-100.

A functional test of the subscriber's dedicated line card is invoked by
DIAGNose. Test equipment measures performance of the line card and reports
deviations from defined levels. Here is what a LTP with line diagnostic
results appears as on the terminal:

Legend: The first line CC CMC...  represents the various maintenance        
        subsystem headers.
        The second line FDIAG 10GC represents a minor alarm condition for   
        line facility diagnostics and a critical alarm condition for 10 trunk 
        groups.
        Alarm status is given in the third line.

Scheduled Line Testing
Full testing of a subscriber loop may be performed using MAP's Line Test
Position Line Test Access (LTPLTA). Internal line test equipment (LTU) in DMS
will be physically connected to a subscriber loop with the Metallic Test
Access Bus (MTA).  Here's what the results of a manually requested line
insulation test appear as:

Using this command the source of a fault and whether its on the subscriber
end or not can be determined. This test is usually run during off-peak hours,
using MAP's Automatic Line Test (ALT) and the Automatic Line Insulation Test
(ALIT). 

System Line Initiated Line Testing
When call processing detects faulty lines they are automatically scheduled to
be diagnosed in queue. The outcome is given to MAP, and a record is printed
in an office log.

Trunk Maintenance
Executes checking, testing, monitoring, status monitoring and verifying
functions to make sure trunks are working right. It also provides a means of
quick troubleshooting when a trunk problem occurs, using the telescoping
process to pinpoint the problem location. An example of a Centralized
Automatic Message Accounting 2-Way (CAMA2W) Trunk is given here:

A technician can choose to conduct trunk testing manually from the Trunk Test
Position (TTP) or automatically from the Automatic Trunk Testing (ATT) level
of the MAP.

.Alarms
Are reported at three levels according to their degree of urgency. In order
of urgency they are Critical, Major and Minor. Alarm thresholds are defined
by an administrator. ie. the percentage of a trunk group that is out of
service before a minor alarm is sent. Audible and visible indicators can be
used locally, in another part of the building or in a remote monitoring
center.  

.Administration

The Table Editor
Consists of a set of commands that will create or change data. The tables and
Table editor is part of the DMS-100's database software. Control is done at
the MAP.

An example of a new trunk addition to an existing trunk group would be:

>table trkmem                      /* TABLE Trunk Member
TABLE TRKMEM:                      
>add otdp1 1                       /*Outgoing Trunk Digit Pulse

Service Orders
Are used to:
- add/remove subscriber service from lines
- add/remove services such as touchtone
- change Line Equipment Numbers (LEN) or the Directory Numbers (DN) of lines

Here's an example of how you can setup a New Single Party Flat Rate (1FR)
with options. In this case the new line will be POTS with touchtone (referred
to as dgt). The new line is part of line treatment group 1. The phone number
or directory number is 555-1212. The line equipment number is 10 1 12 26
(frame 10, unit 1, drawer 14, card 26)

Here is another example of how to install a new Electronic Business Set (EBS)

That is the maintenance interface of DMS-100. If you are under the system, or
any other DMSs for that matter go searching for its dialup number. As you can
tell, there is no end to the things you can configure with it. Such as giving
yourself "special billing" or no billing whatsoever. You can also edit
numbers in different NPAs so a dialup in another NPA would suffice.
