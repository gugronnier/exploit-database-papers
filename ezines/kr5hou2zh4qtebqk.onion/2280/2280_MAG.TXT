                           THE CHRISTMAS VIRUS


     It all began as a joke for Christmas. A student in West Germany wrote
     a little program called "Christma" and  sent  it to all his friends on
     the network of Claustahal Technical University, south of Hanover.
      Sending it through the network was simple: the program handled that by
     reading a couple of files containing lists of all regular corres-
     pondents and all recently sent and received mail: Names and Netlog.
      When the program was run the recipients saw a festive Christmas tree
     appear on their screens. Very nice too. However Christma also secretly
     read the recipients Names and  Netlog  files, moved forward on its
     merry way and, rather ungratefully, then deleted itself from the host.
      The next, rather larger, batch  of  recipients (who were of course all
     used to unknown programs appearing through the network) ran Christma
     as well and saw the pretty graphics come and go. Of course they all had
     Names and Netlog files too...

                        That was December 9th 1987.
 
       No Hard discs scrambled,  no  system  lockups,  no discs infected with
     AIDS... no harm done surely?  Just a seasonal greeting transmitted by 
                                --Page 3--
     good ol' Info Tech.  Well that's what the writer of Christma thought
     too and he was very mistaken.
       The problem lay  in  the  speed  of  communication  and  the increased
     linking of computer networks in many fields.  And continents.
     The virus program spread with accelerating speed throughout Europe
     via its link into EARN: the European Academic Research Network.
     EARN is also linked to universities in the US via Bitnet...hundreds of
     automatic mailers busily  consulted  Netlogs and the  volume  of traffic
     grew exponentially.
       Within TWO DAYS networks were seriously overloaded on both continents.
     By  the  11th  December  the  jamming   was  so  serious  that  system
     programmers from EARN  and Bitnet came together to try to track and kill
     Christma. For the first time in the history of Virus hunting a Seeker
     program was developed (by Eric Thomas of the Ecole Centrale de Paris)
     which traced the flow of Christma by reading Netlog files, chasing and
     then erasing it.  Meanwhile  systems  on  which  Christma had appeared
     were taken off the network while discs were checked.

          By the 14th December the academic networks were free.

     But Christma was not yet dead, although the author probably wished
     that he was. IBM  has  a  private  network  VNET,  which  is linked to
     Bitnet...VNET corporate users tend to hold very large Names files. 
                                --Page 4--
     The entire IBM corporate E-mail system was closed down for 72 hours
     until the infection was eradicated!

                   ::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::


       Horrifying or amusing, depending on your point of view, Christma
     really happened and very recently. The implications for users and
     manufacturers are profound.  We have all heard of Trojan files on
     Bulletin Boards, the Amiga Virus and others not so widely publicised.
     Hardware designers and manufacturers have viewed the issues as
     unimportant to their business. In other words it's the users problem.
     IBM for one may well be rethinking this strategy!
       Technically, it has  been  possible  for  many  years  to design safer
     systems.  A  program should not be able to run in a system that is
     completely unprotected.  It should operate in isolation until tested
     and known. There should be no way that a program can read files without
     the users knowledge and express permission.  Equally, users should be
     more careful about running  programs on systems which are vital to us.
     Easier said than done.
       At present it seems there are no simple solutions except never to down
     load...

 NEWS: Potentially Nasty                                                 Sun
                                                                          SG

   A potentially damaging article appears in today's Observer entitled 'Computer
 Nasties are on the Line.' Written by Observer investigative reporter John 
 Merritt, the article reveals that several bulletin boards in the UK are 
 actively disseminating anarchical information. The Open File report claims 
 that the following information can be read online on BBSs.

 = Top 10 ways to kill a cop
 = How to make oxyacetylene balloon bombs.
 = Breaking into houses
 = An introductory guide to shoplifting
 = How to make tear gas

   The article then goes to give a thumbnail sketch of the UK's BBSs, including 
 a character profile of Darren Ingram, sysop of 'Corrupt Computing,' a bulletin 
 board specialising in the darker side of society.
  Ingram's board contains several areas, one of which is called 'Defence of...
 ... the Realm,' which contains several home defence files covering the topics 
 outlined earlier in this news story. The article has off-the-cuff quotes
 from computer industry luminaries such as John (BBOA) Wallbridge and Alistair
                                --Page 51--
 Kelman, the computer barrister.
   Unfortunately for the online world, the
 Observer article portrays the typical BBS user as armed to the teeth and
 trained in 'survivalist techniques.' This will almost certainly reflect
 badly on BBS and UK online systems,
   Micronet included, and effectively undoes much of the PR work carried
 out by organisations such as the Bulletin Board Operators Association.
 Interestingly, reporter Merritt has been in contact with the Department of
 Trade and Industry and Oftel in a bid to discover who - if anyone - is
 'responsible' for BBSs.
   The DTI is quoted as not knowing which government department should be
 looking at BBSs, but said BBS files and messages would come under Section
 43 of the Telecommunications Act 1984. The Act prohibits the transmission...
 ... of grossly offensive, indecent or obscene messages over the PSTN (public
 switched telephone network). The anti-obscenity provisions of the
 1984 Act were originally aimed at the 'dial-a-porn' services which have
 proliferated in the US. Some watered down services have appeared in the UK
 on 0898 value-added numbers. The Net will be taking a look at the
 Observer article in more depth tomorrow, when we'll discuss the
 ramifications of what could result in the government taking an interest in
 BBSs and other online systems.........

 Following on from The Observer's revelations yesterday about the UK's
 modem users being corrupted by BBSs (GOTO 5 for the full SP), the Net has
 talked to several comms luminaries, many of whom were quoted in The
 Observer article.
   "The Observer chap phoned me up last week for a few comments," said Alistair
 Kelman, the computer barrister. Kelman revealed that the Daily
 Telegraph has also been chatting to comms-oriented establishment people as
 well as The Observer. Despite the article's emphasis on the darker...
 ... side of BBSs, Kelman thinks that the majority of readers will take the
 views of the writer with a pinch of salt.
   Len Stuart, ClubSpot and Netreach supremo, thinks otherwise.
 "The article could be very damaging for modem users generally, as people who
 don't know about comms will assume that Ingram's BBS is typical of all
 boards," said Stuart, adding that the same people will assume that all
 modem users regularly access such BBSs. "Not knowing any differntly, readers...
 ... will make the wrong assumptions about modem users," he added.
   John Collins, ex-Commodore and now freelance programmer on the Atari ST
 and Commodore Amiga, thinks the same. Like Len Stuart, Collins 'phoned the
 Net to draw our attention to the article. 
                                --Page 53--
   "I was horrified by the article," he told the Net. "It's just the sort of
 publicity that we can all do without."
   John Wallbridge, BBOA founder, who is also quoted in The Observer article,...
 ... is equally disparaging about the article.
   "The Observer reporter left out my key comment which was that BBSs are like
 any other medium," he told the Net. "The problem is that all media,
 including BBSs, can be used to print almost anything about anything. I just
 hope that Observer readers don't get the wrong impression about bulletin
 boards generally," he said.
   Wallbridge is so incensed by The Observer article that - in common
 with several other comms industry figures - he feels that a response
 from the online community is called for.
   "At the very least, I think that a letter to The Observer is called for,"
 he said.
   All the comms industry figures the Net has spoken to this weekend have agreed
 that The Observer article was 'over the top' and not typical of BBSs generally.
 It's likely that the article will have stirred up enough public outrage to
 generate governmental interest in how BSSs are run. It is to be hoped that -
 as with all exposes of this nature - the furore dies down quickly.

                     THE NECCESITY OF DEVIANCE
                    ___________________________
                         By Jack Stevenson

  In the Ideal utopia, individual freedomflourishes. In such a state of 
existence there would be no deviants since there would be nothing to deviate 
from. Everyone would bloom like a beautiful flower according to their own 
precaurioyus individual natures. There would be no stifling society codes, no 
predjudice, no repression, no crime.
  Unfortunately, or rather fortunately, Utopia is unobtainable. Deviation is 
the only thing that's kept the human race from dying off from bad ideas, lack 
of style or just plain boredom, not to mention tyranny, incompetence or 
stupidity.
  As it is, within every religion, within every country, within every city and 
small town, deviance springs up unwanted like some ugly evil mushroom, much to 
the horror of civil and moral "authorities." It is the one irrepressible, 
ineludable constant of human existence. Thank God.
  It is the deviant, at first persecuted, then martyred and worshipped, who 
changes society, starts all the new religions and philosophies. It is the 
deviant virus buzzing around in the rotted innards of established countrys and 
belief systems that keeps the decaying carcass on it's feet until something 
paramutates off, and it crashes to the ground a stinking corpse... although 
                                --Page 56--
sometimes it actually takes a few centuries to fall over.
  On a less grandoise scale, deviation worms it's way into fashion, art, and 
every other form of human conduct, often while the guise of perfect 
respectability is maintained. Deviance is a neccesity of life, on a par with 
food, shelter and clothing. And like any other activity, it can be pursued in 
a cowardly, or courageous fashion.
  Society seeks to maintain the status quo out of pure bloated inertia. 
Industrialization gave rise to the middle class in all developed countries, 
and soon the middle class had began it's own culture: a culture of cowardice, 
conformity and sterility whose holy ground became the suburbs. Conformity was 
required, the Status quo worshipped.
  Yet the stricter the status-quo is enforced by social codes, the more 
widespread the deviant urge becomes: today the suburbs are hot-beds of 
deviance and depravity, while inner cities - admittedly more violent - are 
staid in comparison.
  Look through any window in suburbia to see men dressed in leotards or neo-
nazis in full regelia drowning kittens in bath tubs while through ghetto 
windows, you see earnest young dope dealers and pimps chasing the standard 
capitalist dream. Sexual and other deviations are shunned in the ghettos while 
the suburbs provide the privacy, leisure time and money to engage in such 
activities. 
  It is the pointlessness and boredom of middle class life more than anything 
that spurs and motivates people into a life of deviance. Poor people are too
                                --Page 57-- 
busy trying to "make it", chasing commercial images of success, and rich 
people hide all their glorious deviance behind the impenetrable wall of 
discretion propriety. It is out of the belly of the middle class that pulls a 
virtual army of "deviance" as they are quick to be called. Punk rockers are 
drop-outs from suburbia, with their anti-beauty esthetics. Before them the 
Hippies were the drop-outs with their drugs and anti-materialism. Many Gays in 
New York, San Fransisco and other big cities are escapees from middle class 
conformity. A thousand bizarre cults worldwide are gourged on the children of 
the middle class. It is the greatest contribution of the middle class to 
culture.
  Deviance in it's most spectacular, sensational and violent forms has become 
a new religion, merging Punk rock with Satanism, Nazism and modern death 
technology. Mark Pauline, a San Fransisco artist, builds engine powered 
contraptions, that animate the corpses of chickens and rabbits in a grotesque 
fandango. Autopsy videos are all the latest rage, and a small mouvement of 
Xeroxed fanzines that idolize mass-murderers is cropping up, reflecfting wider 
interest in this new industrial death culture that has in fact been well 
recieved in the art world.
  Mass murderers are replacing football players as focal points of youthful 
fascination. Gilles de Rais emerges from the muck of his history as the John 
The Baptist of this new order. The richest noble and bravest knight of early 
15th century France, de Rais won a prominent place in French history books for 
his battlefield heroism in the cause of Joan Of Arc, personally rescuing her
                                --Page 58-- 
from the English at least twice. His later career as a lunatic, devil 
worshipper and sex murderer of hundreds of young peasant children won him a 
place in the wax museums.
  Ed Gein, killer and cannibal of the American 1950s, exploded as a blinding 
supernova in the holy firmament of sexual deviance. Inhabiting an unworked 
farm in rural Wisconsin, Gein impressed neighbors as a mildly retarded 
simpleton who hung out with kids and was good for handyman chores and helping 
road crews chop weeds along the highway. Yet Gein's peaceable manner concealed 
the soul of a freinzied deviant: by night he engaged in murder, graverobbing 
and necrophilia, as well as the manufacture of human lampshades, chair seats, 
nipple belts and skull caos. All of Gein's crimes were traced back to a desire 
to revive his dead mother from her grave and driven out of control by a 
twisted sexual urge. Perhaps the ongoing celebration of Ed Gein is a reaction 
to the sterile sexual teases of Pop icons such as Doris Day and Annete 
Funicello who purveyed a dehumanized aura of sex that Gein actually came to 
practice.
  Charles Manson is certainly well enough known, both by the myth and reality 
(if in fact they can be seperated). Yet while Manson dabbled in Satanism and 
admired the Nazis, he was a different phenomenon than either medieval castle-
dwelling de Rais or farmboy idiot/introvert Gein. Manson became the great 
hollywood killer and his ledgend has been enshrined by media circus parole 
hearings and annual televising of Helter Skelter that are as eagerly awaited 
as The Wizard of Oz. "I live in my world," said Manson in prison in 1970, "and 
                                --Page 59--
I am the king of my world, wether it be in a garbage dump or if it be in the 
desert or wherever it be, I am my own human being. You may restrain my body 
and you may tear my guts out, do anything you wish, but I am still me and you 
can't take that." Is it any wonder Manson strikes a chord with teenagers, 
deviants and outcasts constantly bucking the norm?
  Finally there is John Gacy. If mass-murderers are considered the ultimate 
deviants then John Gacy is an ironic contradiction. While Gacy was a killer, 
a more average, normal, successful and respected member of the community you 
could not find. He was the quintessential suburban "well respected man." His 
taste in everything from houses to cars to backyard barbeques was middle class 
suburban. None of this cult-worship commune jazz for him, his world revolved 
around the gravity core of middle class respectable. Because of this, he could 
never admit, and in fact to this day denies, that he is gay. He has been 
called by some "The Ultimate closet Queen" and the results of his reppresion 
and self-loathing became national headlines in 1979.
  While Gacy is a pretty poor role model for any self-respecting deviant, he 
is the current mass-murder record holder and hence earns the respect of the 
pure-mided death cultists who despise any hint of insanity or cultism. Manson 
and Gein on the other hand were more flamboyant and colourful characters and 
have enjoyed popularity on a wider scale, inspiring movies and songs and even 
bleeding a little bit into pop culture. Gilles de Rais, though, remains almost 
unknown to the population, with their fast-food slaughters and shopping-centre 
massacres while in history-concious France, he is known to every schoolboy.

  Other mass killers have made the jump from police reports into pop ledgend. 
Jim Jones was the ultimate cult leader and fake Mohammed. Charles Starkweather 
was the 1950's own white-trash James Dean/Rebel without a cause, and Lizzi 
Borden slaughtered her parents - What red-blooded Teenager hasn't thought 
about it? Today there are endless Hillside Stranglers, Highway killers, 
Nightstalkers, mad Slashers, berserk snipers holed up in schoolhouses, and 
walking time bombs exploding in post offices and fast-food restaurants.
  And so, much to the horror of their parents, our young people find heroes 
aplenty in today's "world". Or perhaps I should say anti-heros. To today's 
youth, getting stabbed to death or getting blown apart in an explosion dosn't 
seem much worse than dying of boredom, and certainly it's quicker, you might 
even get on TV.
  Modern society seems a faceless, homogenized, sterile place... predictable, 
circumcised, pre-conditioned. The impulsive, the violent, the anti-social is 
admired and at times emulated. The deviant is our new hero.
