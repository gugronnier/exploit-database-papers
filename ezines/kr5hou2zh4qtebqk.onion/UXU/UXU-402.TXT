                      MY COLLECTION OF REJECTION LETTERS
                       by THE GNN/DualCrew-Shining/uXu


People publish the strangest things nowadays. I have seen files that -
without any apparent reason - contain lists over the writer's collection
of CDs, magazines, video tapes, flowers, ashtrays, wall-papers, guns,
girlfriends, boyfriends, pimples, previously released lists of lists, etc.
   Anyway, why should I be any worse? Why should I go around and believe
that I am special, better than everybody else - just because I have never
published any list?
   Welcome to my personal collection of rejection letters. I have collected
them for a long time now, since whenever I am bored I open up the Writer's
and Artist's Yearbook 1976 at a random page and mail yet another worthless
MS to the address my finger aimlessly falls down on.
   So far, I have collected these fine letters:


TOM DOHERTY ASSOCIATES INC.

   Dear writer,

   Thank you for giving us a chance to read your book or proposal. We
   are sorry that we don't feel it is right for TOM/FORGE at this time.
      Because the volume of submissions we receive, we are not able to
   reply individually to each writer, but please be assured that your
   work received a careful evaluation.
      We wish you the best luck with your writing career.

   Sincerely,
   The Editors


RANDOM HOUSE

   Dear Sir,

   Thank you for sending us your material. Unfortunately it is not
   suitable for our lists, and we are returning it herewith. We are
   very sorry that we cannot write personally, and neither can we
   enter into correspondence in respect of rejected slips. The number
   of submissions we receive makes this impossible.

   Yours sincerely,
   The Editors


PENGUIN PRESS UNITED KINGDOM

   Dear Sir,

   Thank you for your letter. Unfortunately, Penguin are not longer
   able to consider unsolicited fiction due to the number of
   submissions received daily and the enormous amount of time involved
   in dealing with them.

   Yours sincerely,
   Penguin Press UK


BIG TITS MAGAZINE

   Dear pervert,

   As you might notice, this letter is clinically free from semen. This
   indicates that your erotic short story was a fiasco.

   Your sincerely,
   The Masturbation Crew at BTM


POLITICS AND BIG GUNS WEEKLY

   Dear revolutionary,

   We have carefully considered your submission to the PABGW magazine.
   Unfortunately, the material is not suitable for our publication.
   Due to the shit-load of submissions we receive every day from fringe
   political conspirators, we are unable to write to you personally.
      The reason why your article was rejected might be because it
   contained any of these words/concepts: 1) "Nazism", 2) "Fascism",
   3) "Anarchy", 4) "Freedom", 5) "Love", 6) "Humanity", or 7) "Bomb".
   If your article contained any of these words, do not hesitate to
   submit it again, after you have changed them into: 1) "The Good Old
   Days", 2) "Modern Democracy", 3) "Crazy Maniacs", 4) "Security",
   5) "Nonsense", 6) "Herd", or 7) "My penis".

   Kill a Commie for Mommie,
   The Editors

HOUSE OF JESUS AND COMPANY

   Dear Son,

   Thank you for praying to God. Unfortunately, your request for 'fame
   and fortune in the writing-business' has been denied because of the
   Greed-clause. Due to the huge amount of spoiled humans in the
   universe that demands our attention every damn minute, we are unable
   to reply to you personally. But we can assure you that your minor
   problems has been carefully examined - just for the sake of it. Haha.
   Enough joking. Bring out the beer and the cheap broads. Let's get
   some action around this place. EVERYBODY DANCE NOW BOOM BOOM BOOM ON
   YOUR BLACK ASS BITCH

   yeah yeah yeah,
   The Angels


(... and finally, the moment we have all been waiting for...)

UNDERGROUND EXPERTS UNITED

   Dear Sir,

   Thank you for your mail enclosing the manuscript of 'My Collection
   of Rejection-Letters'. No chance in HELL we will publish this SHIT.
   uXu receives tonnes of worthless CRAP every day, and I am sorry to
   inform you that your submission was yet another of these pathetic
   examples of 'writing' I have the misfortune to read every DAMN day.
   But I can assure you that your file was given careful examination
   before I FLUSHED IT DOWN THE TOILET together with my own excrement.
   Do not bother to mail me any letter with questions on exactly why I
   did not fancy your WORTHLESS expression of art, because I need not
   justify my good taste and wit in front of mindless INSECTS like you.

   FUCK OFF,
   Bravemoore
