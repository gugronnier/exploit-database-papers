        Poetry Collection # 4

        ------------------------------------------------------------

        Greetings hoards of fan. Yes that's right, I have maybe one
        fan, but I do not write this stuff for everyone. My poems
        may not be the best but nobody else could write them, nobody
        else knows how I feel, how I think. My last poetry set was
        mostly love poems, well it was time for a change and I did.

        See if you can guess what's going on with me, see if you can
        understand. Oh yeah, since last poetry thing I started on a
        book of sorts of my poetry. I'm not planning on having it
        published, but who knows, I may send it in to some poetry
        magazine or something, maybe I'll get lucky.

        Tide of Love
        ---

        our love washes up like the tide
        as strong as the ocean
        our tears of happiness
        insecurity is out only crime

        to be stranded on an deserted isle
        nothing but your love to keep me company
        your love will keep me alive for quite some while
        your the one that i want with me

        when we're apart we feel a little sad
        we miss each others warm love
        when we talk everything brightens up
        awaiting the next we will meet

        sleeping on the beaches the tide comes in
        your love envelops me and makes me a new man
        the tears i cry for happiness is the greatest feeling
        being born again, you are the only thing i need

        ------------------------------------------------------------
        Alone
        ---

        floating, gradually
        moving towards, moving away
        dark, bright, the long fight
        feel it, devouring

        eyes, seeing nothing
        blindness devoid
        nothing to hear, nothing to see
        living in darkness, nothing to see

        pain, fast, force, pounding
        courage, hopefulness
        shattering like glass
        the hammer meets the anvil

        standing beside yourself
        look at the lies
        the rope tightens, tighter
        hope soars away, like a glider

        ------------------------------------------------------------
        Vein
        ---

        slamming, the pain
        blood boils in my veins
        fists to the wall
        ready to take the fall

        the stabbing, the hand
        more pain for every grain of sand
        blind by the stabbing
        coarsing through the veins

        tapping away
        the pain never goes
        fighting the way
        the blood of the rose

        lightening quickens
        electrical pain through the tendons
        pressure, pressing down
        it's easy to drown

        ------------------------------------------------------------
        Follower
        ---

        following the lead
        what ever can you do
        following the leader
        nothing better to do

        what else is there?
        who else could surrender
        they mock you
        they flock upon you

        defensive weakness
        obsessive obedience
        quivering in the darkness
        the fear takes over

        take them upon your wing
        what else could you do?
        they won't sing
        how can they?

        ------------------------------------------------------------
        Annoyance
        ---

        annoyance
        how dare they
        don't they understand me?
        won't they stand with me?

        they ave no idea
        no fein of knowing
        they are themselves
        not even knowing

        emotional rage
        misunderstanding
        don't they get it
        there is no calming

        anger and sadness
        taking a stand for my madness
        there is nothing worse
        nothing more, no sadness

        ------------------------------------------------------------
        Lonely Death
        ---

        sitting by myself
        thinking i'm wrong
        sitting by myself
        nobody around

        nobody to talk to
        nobody to share with
        nobody to tell
        nobody at all

        never with anyone
        with someone, alone
        nobody understands
        never do

        so empty inside
        nobody to fill me
        nobody's tried
        i die inside

        ------------------------------------------------------------
        Silent Rage
        ---

        nobody to hear me
        nobody to hear my silent rage
        silent tears
        silence showing it's age

        the wordless sadness
        the quiet anger
        i speak with my tears
        falling on deaf ears

        the music of a thousand mimes
        filling my head
        their screams shattering
        driving me mad

        feel my fear
        this silent rage
        see my pain
        please, turn the page

        ------------------------------------------------------------
        Impatience
        ---

        standing alone
        waiting for the bus
        sitting in my room
        no phone will ring

        contemptual confusion
        misguided illusion
        pent up frustration
        psychotic limitation

        silent listening
        deafening nothing
        passing time
        nothing to do

        thumping of the beat
        you can't beat this heat
        the anger grows inside
        there is no place to hide

        misdirected revolt
        nothing to keep, nothing to say
        there is nothing worse
        nothing like waiting

        ------------------------------------------------------------
        Insane
        ---

        running still
        standing still
        no movement on high
        feel the thrill

        despise the goodness
        avoid the bad
        destroying the middle
        nothing

        running on high
        trying to touch the sky
        the heat is searing
        trying to melt my wing

        aluminum destruction
        caffeine seduction
        the lethargy is upon us
        destroy every one, leave the bus

        scrambling for destruction
        rambling seduction
        the bitter cold, the cold heat
        the fire that dies, lit the skies

        the warmth the cold
        the feeling of the void
        the room with no mirrors
        the view was full of errors

        Poetry Collection # 5

        ------------------------------------------------------------

        Hello,

        It's been a while since I wrote any poetry and I believe
        this shall be my last collection. Yeah yeah, I hear you all
        now. Death to BobSlack you say, Enough of his insane poems,
        what a dumbass.

        Well, perhaps all of you aren't saying that, perhaps none.
        Who knows, in any case I believe with this last poetry
        collection that this marks the point where I get into what
        I really wanna do.

        Game design. Who knows, maybe there will be a game out in
        the future by me, you know. Panther Modern Softs or
        FnordWare or whatever. I do know one thing for sure, I am
        gonna do one killer game based on William Gibson's Sprawl
        type world!

        Oh yeah, oe more thing.. No more wimmenz for a while, they
        suck!

        Past Future
        ---

        time flows like a winding water
        as blue and unstoppable as the ocean
        life goes by like lightening
        sometimes it is so frightening

        things past, things undone
        old feelings suddenly emerge
        nothing to do but the future
        nothing to do but realize

        an old friend a special person
        a past of things half done
        realization is the main factor
        and love is another one

        the roots of true friendship run deep
        even seeable from a deep sleep
        the love that was there
        is renewed like a flame burning

        yearning for the times to be
        there is nothing to do about the past
        you just have to wait and see
        and do your best

        Krickets in the Attic
        ---

        sitting at home
        your life is so noexistant
        sitting at home
        you feel so obedient

        avoiding the problems
        the solutions at hand
        lacking the courage to fight em
        or perhaps too much heart

        giving so much
        common courtesy is a lost cause
        leach all given none
        sooner or later you have to run

        live it up feel the joy
        you deserve happiness like every girl or boy
        find someone, something special
        live the love, nothing is so level

        it's time to take what's yours
        you feel so much desolation
        it's time for you to fix it
        you have the solution so don't nix it

        ------------------------------------------------------------
        Free Communication
        ---

        the line is busy
        your never home
        no free time to spend
        your not by the phone

        continually waiting
        it seems like an eternity
        continually debating
        will you be free for me?

        so little time
        so much to say
        so many interruptions
        there is no other way

        kidnapping is out of the word
        leaving on impulse is almost absurd
        caged in, you have no word
        what i have to say remains unheard

        so little time for me
        so much for me to say
        no chance to speak
        it is your freedom i seek

        ------------------------------------------------------------
        The Dead Fool
        ---

        everybody watching my every move
        i'm just trying to feel the groove
        listening to every word you say
        believing every bit

        it doesn't matter what you say
        what you mean is obvious
        even if it's true for me
        they are all lies to me

        i believe every word
        you believe what you say
        the joke's on you
        nothing could be so hard

        paying the price for my pain
        dementia searing thru me like burning flames
        feel the hot pain the cold pleasure
        the immense feeling like i'm in a grave

        i'm dead inside living out a lie called life
        striving to fool everyone
        there is nothing but death of emotions
        i'm the fool to feel

        ------------------------------------------------------------
        Fear of Weird
        ---

        running down the streets
        the dark alley ways
        everybody is staring at me
        what is so different?

        i change myself
        i try to cloak myself
        in the normal weirdness that's me
        burning out my eyes

        think an thought so alien
        feel the emotions of a million
        the pain the pleasure
        too intense to bear

        cloak myself in shadows
        hide in isolation
        the feeling is so intense
        the fear, i can't budge an inch

        ------------------------------------------------------------
        Love Lies
        ---

        one thing shatters
        another crumbles
        life around me
        flatter and flatter

        first you cancel the wine
        then you cancel the room
        now you cancel the time
        i fear for my doom

        life seems so fake
        trust is the only thing we have
        it seems to be faltering
        so disguised so disgusted

        the truth seems like lies
        lies are the real truth
        nothing is true yet nothing is a lie
        love is so confusing, what a lie

        ------------------------------------------------------------
        Impeach the Workshop
        ---

        old anticipation
        a flood of excitement
        death of resignation
        nothing but an informant

        gathering the information
        supplying the definition
        rebuilding the lost
        trashing what's toast

        old emptiness
        everything is free
        too much under
        home of the teens

        nothing but take
        nothing is returned
        home of the intelligent?
        no title was earned

        leach leach
        death to the king
        the masses tear us down
        impeachment is the thing

        ------------------------------------------------------------
        Lies of the King
        ---

        deafness, silence
        nothing to be said
        nothing is heard
        blank, silence, nothing

        running away from the light
        the music make it all feel right
        nothing is as bright
        nothing but an unending night

        superstition
        demons filling your head
        the lies you tell yourself
        your better off dead

        listening to yourself alone
        defending your uneven throne
        you are the one powerful
        unready to take your fall

        ------------------------------------------------------------
        Videogame
        ---

        new technology new imagination
        the life it breathes into me
        the wholesome containment
        shatter

        the levels of depth
        the depth of color
        blindly fast
        no more cash

        the uneventful adventure
        the dieing breed
        nothing is left of life
        nothing to read

        lightening reflexes
        a killer mood
        nothing is left
        nothing is good
