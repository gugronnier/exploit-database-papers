                              LETTER TO A PRISONER
                        by THE GNN/DualCrew-Shining/uXu

   Written for the one and only dominator: Dirtybush / Dual Crew-Shining.


        "You don't have to change anything, just find a fall-guy..."




   Crime does not pay, some say. But it must pay well sometimes, since so
many people do steal. Some win and some lose, it is all a game in the end.
Unfortunately, you lost one of your bets, otherwise you would not end up in
the slammer. You are a free man now, however, and this is the letter I was
supposed to send you. But I never did - I do not know why, I guess I never
managed to finish it properly. It still feels incomplete, more ought to be
said. But I will save those words for another rainy day.

   Maybe you wonder why I never visited you in jail? The answer is simple,
but yet true: who would like to see you behind bars? If I want to see
something in a cage I go to a zoo. I have no need to see the result of
primitive human thinking from the inside.
   Prisons are pretty nice nowadays, I figure. You are not forced to drink
water and eat bread together with the rats. Still, that is no excuse. Prisons
are, and will be, a fine symbol of society's failure. This failure is not
a 'real' failure however. It is more a symbol of laziness. Society may be
good at building prisons, because that is easy work. You just use some hard,
grey concrete. Anyone could do that.
   Thinking, however, is not that easy. Society does not fancy theory. We
improve the prisons with TV and gently ask the rats to move to another place.
We never think about 'the need for prisons.' They are just there, ready to
swallow the criminal person. We have not really advanced when it comes to
rational thinking as we want to believe. When we were monkeys, I guess we
hit the monkey that stole from us. Now, we do the same thing, but with more
style. But the essence is still the same: We are just monkeys, hitting the
thief-monkey with the nearest branch.
   The common question to conclusions like the above one is, naturally,
'Hey, if you are so smart, perhaps you could tell us what we ought to do
instead? If we are not supposed to throw criminals into prison, what are
we going to do then?'
   Let me put it this way; I do not care. I am not a politician, I am a
realist. The construction of the future is not my thing. I develop my
personal dignity by understanding things. Those who ask a question like
the above are not even trying to understand. They just want things
to be like it has always been, because that is the easiest way. No one
is forced to think and understand if things remain status quo.

   Let us change the topic a little bit: I know (and you know for sure)
that you actually were guilty to some of the crimes in question, no arguments
about that. You did not spend your time in jail 'without reason,' as some
people do. However, the word 'were' is incorrect; According to the legal
system you ARE guilty. Or more precise; you are STILL guilty. There is no
such thing as 'paying your debt to society'. Once a thief, always a
thief. I know you have noticed that irritating phenomena.

   But if we look at the concept 'guilty' a bit closer, we will notice that
you were guilty 'according to the legal system', not according to some divine
moral system, or equal. That is an important detail.
  You were guilty because The Rule Book we play with in the global society
said so. When we play a game of chess, we know that the game is over when
the King is mate. We accept these rules when we play chess. This is because
we, roughly speaking, sign a contract to follow these rules every time we
play chess. But when did we sign the contract that said that we must follow
the rules of society? The day someone steps up to me and shows my signature
on a contract that bounds me the follow the legal system - then I will
accept the rules. But now, since there is no such contract with my
signature, I see no reason why I should just accept that other people might
put me in jail.
   I play a game, but I cannot recall that I have ever chosen to play this
particular game we call 'The Legal System'.
   People will oppose to this idea. If people had to sign a contract, this
world would turn into anarchy, they claim. Why? Not because NO ONE would
sign it, that would be most improbable. No, because SOME people would not
sign it. And what would we do with those that did not sign it? Well, I say,
who cares? What would we do if there were too many people on this planet?
Kill a couple of them, because they 'were not good for the society'? That
would be a violation of humanity, because individuals have a 'natural'
right to life. But why do we not have the 'natural' right to do whatever
we want to? There sure is nothing 'natural' in being forced to follow the
global Rule Book.
   Just because a phenomena is global, it does not by necessity have to
be good nor true. Several billions believe in 'god'. Does that mean that
'god' exists? Not necessarily. Several billions follow the global rule
book, the legal system. Does that mean that it is good? Perhaps. But
are we forced to follow it? Yes, some say. And I once again ask: where on
earth is that contract I signed when I accepted that?
   It's a shame that people do not try to answer that question. But it is
an even greater shame that people do not even ASK the question.

   I am worried about one thing: Now, when you are free, will you stop
thinking for yourself? Jail is a dangerous place, because it scares the
shit out of most people. No one wants to end up there, and no one wants
to go back after a little vacation behind bars. This feeling can turn
people into walking zombies who oppress their personal beliefs because
they do not dare to challenge the society.
   Their line of thinking is like this - 'I WANT to do this, but I will
not do it, because other people might throw me in Jail'. In equal, they
never do what they want. They do not say what they want to say, they do
not criticize things they find to be wrong - because other people might
find their opinions wrong and dangerous. That is not healthy.
   But, if I know you right, I should not worry. You will never play by
other peoples rules, you will not accept them without signing the contract.
   We have our own rules and we gladly follow them. If people dislike
that, never mind. Those people who turned you in will some day be aware of
how our rules work. They will be forced to play our game. When that happens,
THEY will ask for the contract with their signature - the contract that
bounds THEM to follow OUR rules. But there will be no such contract, as
there no contract that bounds us to their rules.
   There will be a conflict. In that conflict, certain people will notice
that our rules can hurt too.

   I leave you with a quote: "The construction of the future and the
completeness for all times is not our task. What we at present have to do
is the reckless critique of all the existing - reckless in the sense that
the critique is not afraid of its results and likewise not afraid of
conflicts with the existing powers."  (P.M. Bergman)
