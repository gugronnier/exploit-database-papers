                           Ripped off - big time.



  You probably have seen the "competitions" advertised by big software
  companies in newsgroups and newspapers. They want you to try to break or
  prove that their product's security is weak and breakable.
    I must admit that it's much better than hiring your own computer
  security staff to do this, but what's in it for you? In most cases, a
  pathetic price and a pat in the back for a job well done.

    You spend hours and hours trying to break their product's security
  because you know it's possible! For all that, you receive a lousy T-shirt
  in the mail. You get really mad because you know the company itself will
  make millions, perhaps even billions just because you helped them fix
  their product's problem.
    You promise yourself that this was the last time you ever helped these
  people out. There is a chance though, but only if they would give you an
  appropriate reward for your work.
    Next time, you will probably make more money breaking their security
  after it's been released and promised "secure".

    You really would like to find out how many copies of "The Wondiws TN
  Cracking Kit" or "PicoHard Network hack maschine" you could sell for a
  cheap buck.

    Or why not just post it on some newsgroups for free.

    If they want to commercialize The Net, they got it.

    Think about it.
