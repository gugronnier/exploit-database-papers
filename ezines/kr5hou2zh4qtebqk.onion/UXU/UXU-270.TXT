                   Pray for me



 The future was frightening   You brought back hope
 For the world and it's people

 Maybe there really is a light   Met many people
 But you discovered me

 So very different   Still so alike
 You filled up the hole in my soul

 Nothing is really clear   Though all I see is brightness
 Made me see myself from other angles

 Our lives have been different   We only grew stronger
 The lessons we learned made us come to the same conclusions

 Much I have told you   Even more remains to be said
 Things I know and things I have seen

 Done strange deeds in my days   Never cared nor thinking it through
 You became the most wonderful exception

 Waiting I have done many times before   This time it feels right
 I will be where you want me to

 Is it you or me   Who is going away
 I can not see the difference

 We will be apart   But still so very close
 In my mind there is no distance, there is no time

 I feel and know I will hold you again   Again and forever
 I know I will change but this feeling will last

 Some things I feel   Some things I am quite sure of
 This one thing I really know

 Pray for me   For my future
 For my time with you

 Pray for me   Pray for us
 I will always be with you
