                                 [Critics]

        Something  that  always amazes  me when I read  my  morning
        paper  is  the amount of critics that get to write  in  it.
        They  complain about  how  bad  some  movie  or  play  they
        have seen is.  And they go on  and  on  about  how  bad  it
        was. I wonder if they  have  a  template  where  they  just
        fill  in the name of the movie or the play and then  change
        some  of  the  words  so  that  no  one  will  notice   the
        difference.  Here  in  Europe it is almost  as  if  it  was
        forbidden  to  write a good review of a movie  produced  in
        the USA.
        Also, they review books "for us". The thought is perhaps to
        spare  us  from  the books that are badly written  or  just
        plain  garbage.  I wonder if it has  ever  occurred  to any
        of the critics that people have  different taste.  I wonder
        why  people  read  their  fucking articles at all!  How can
        they possibly  think  that  one person that they have never
        met is capable of judging what they  should  read,  what is
        shit and what is not?
        I believe that this is a major  symptom  of  the  bug  that
        our  society  has catched. Papers and TV-companies actually
        have people employed to think for us! Critics do  not  have
        any  function in our society.  When the critics write their
        articles,  they  are  not  doing it because they think that
        some  author  or some  movie director  could  perhaps  do a
        better job if they write some  constructive  criticism,  no
        they write their stuff because they want to   prove  to  us
        "dumb" people that  they   are intellectual, and capable of
        doing a much better job if they wanted to.
        For  example,  Ace Of Base (ok ok, perhaps you  don't  like
        them, just wait though) is being seriously targeted here in
        Sweden  by  our "music-critics". They write  all  sorts  of
        stuff  about  this band, how bad they play, how  ugly  they
        are, how bad their choreographic is.

        How come they sell so good?

        Some people like them!

        Not the critics though!

        Why?

        BECAUSE THEY ARE JUST PLAIN JEALOUS LOSERS!

        A  lot of people read their  articles and form some kind of
        opinion  about  this  band  after  they  have read it - but
        before they have actually heard the music.  Or people trust
        the critics  because they are so  smart and  successful  so
        they  get to  write  stuff in a magazine.  We all know that
        everything printed in a paper is always true, right?
        Perhaps Ace Of Base isn't one of my personal favorites, but
        they do  deserve to get a fair chance - like everyone else.
        Imagine what you might have  missed all these years because
        you have listened to  some  of  these  losers!  There might
        be  some  really good music or some really good  books  you
        have not read because a sucker wrote it down totally. Maybe
        he had a bad day when he wrote the review.  Maybe his  wife
        left him. Maybe his cat got pregnant - by the dog. Maybe he
        got a positive AIDS-test back.
        Maybe he is just a jealous loser.
