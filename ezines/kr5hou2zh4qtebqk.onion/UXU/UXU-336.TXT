*   The intro.   "He sat quiet for a moment and pretended to consult
                  his famous memory block with direct access..."

                                              - Arthur C. Clarke

*   Hello there! How are you? Spending your summer at the beach or in
*   front of the computer? In any case, we hope that you will find our
*   new release interesting and entertaining enough to read at either
*   place. That's right. We all have to sit down for a while sometimes,
*   to consult our memory blocks. If not to write introductions to uXu
*   releases, to recap our thoughts. And read uXu files! The thought
*   behind this release is pain. No, but seriously - we're a couple of
*   months "late", as usual, but then again, we have about two and a
*   half release to flood your mailboxes and systems with. Files from
*   all members and contributors but one this time. 

*   By the way, I tracked down The GNN and Phearless and soaked them
*   in gasoline and.. well.. heh heh. No no, they did a fine job with
*   the release last time, and I got a chance to explore Boston, MA and
*   New York City, NY. Loved East Village - loved Brownie's. I will be
*   back! Nothing can stop me, except those numerous forms one have to
*   fill out before crossing the US border. What do they expect? That
*   someone would answer "Yes" on those questions about if one has a
*   criminal record, if one is a drug addict, or a communist? Please...

*   "Dom s{ger att jag varit farlig, alltid har jag varit svag, dom s{ger
*    det {r n}t med mitt huvud, men ingenting har n}gonsin varit s} n{ra
*    ett svar...ingenting n}gonsin..." - Kent

    uXu, through Anonymous FTP?  uXu Mailing List?  FSP?  WWW?

*   You got it! All files (0-336) are available from the sites listed at the
    end of this file. These sites will get the new releases after the people
    on the Mailing-List have received their packages.

    If you have an Internet address, you can subscribe to uXu (and request
    back-issues) by emailing uxu-request@lysator.liu.se. When you request
    back-issues, please list the number(s) of the issue(s) instead of
    title(s). Example:

    Subject: uXu BACK-ISSUES

    Body: 001, 100, 123, 321

    To subscribe, just let the body of the letter contain the word
    "SUBSCRIBE", and every new release will be mailed to you as soon
    as it is ready. Simple and easy.

    If you do not want all the files mailed to you, but just a single
    message that tells you when a release is out: Send email to
*   uxu-info-request@lysator.liu.se with the subject "subscribe".

        Be a part of the uXu team!  Here's what you need to know...
   ---------------------------------------------------------------------

   If you're on any kind of net connected in any way to the Internet
   just email The Chief (chief@lysator.liu.se) asking for information
   on how to join (subject: "Join uXu"). If you're interested in making
   your BBS, site or whatever a distribution site: (subject: "uXu Dist").
   You will have the information you requested in your mailbox ASAP.

   If you're not on any kind of net connected in any way to the Internet
   it's a bit tricky. Then you have to call one of the boards listed at
*  the end of this file and leave private mail to uXu. The tricky bit
   includes a bit of waiting on your side for a reply.

March  June  March  June  March  June  March  June Releases 1996:

315: "The Terrorists of Dissatisfaction" by The GNN.   There are those
who consider life to be boring and frustrating. Then there are those
who are happy, who enjoy life to the limit. On what side are you? In
any case, as you are on one, or even both sides sometimes, this file
concerns you.

316: "Alien Invasion" by Joseph.   You might think that we are not alone
in this universe. You might have heard people talk, watched programs on
the TV, read books, reports and newspapers, about meeting aliens. In their
backyards, on a field, in their bed. Can this really be true?

317: "Daddy's Girl" by Knyttet.   Most accidents happen in your own home.
Most people's problems are domestic ones. Things that happen in your house
can really change your life, contrary to general belief. Here, Knyttet
tells you a bit about such problems.

318: "Bitte Denken!" by Joseph.   Are you one of those who think that
the government is experimenting with your brain when you watch the TV
or read the papers? Do you question everything that is said to you?
Then you do not need to read this short, but informational text.

319: "What Is This Thing Called The System?" by The GNN.   What do
you think The System is? Is it really Them working in the government,
the agencies, those who have the power? Well, then you just might
want to read this one, and think again.

320: "Time" by Knyttet.   You have probably thought of time several
times in your life, but have you really considered what time really
is? And why does it exist? For what purpose? If you threw away your
watch, would you be timeless? Here are some thoughts on the subject.

321: "Critics" by Joseph.   Critics can be found everywhere in our
society today. They review books, paintings, movies, music, plays,
magazines, festivals.. well, you name it, and there they are. And
they are getting more and more attention. They are on their way to
stardom! But why? Why do we listen to them even? And who decided that
their taste is the collective good one?

322: "Staying Sane" by Ralph 124C41+.   You hear a lot during a day,
don't you? People tell you things, you listen to the radio and you
watch the TV. But sometimes, they say things that you just can't
grasp - things that you know to be the truth, but they tell you
different. Things they say are true, but you can never check them
for yourself.

323: "Don't Date Me" by Joseph.   So you have been dumped by your
girlfriend. Again. What can you do about it? Just go with the flow
as usual. Cry a bit, then start over again with the next girl you
meet? How long will you cope with this? For this guy, it was enough.

324: "Games People Play" by The GNN.   There are important games and
then there are _important_ games. Do you consider any World Cup,
the Olymic Games or Stanley Cup to be _important_, you will probably
reconsider after reading this one.

325: "Three Ways Total Losers Get Even" by The Chief.   When total losers
are out to get even, you know what will happen. That's right, they will
just get themselves into more trouble. In this file, The Chief brings up
three of the most useless "get even" advice ever or never published.

326: "Doing Dunblane" by Joseph.   For those of you with your nose in
the newspaper, here is somewhat of a story taken from the news. Well,
almost anyway. If you have heard the name Dunblane, you know what it
is all about, though not quite. Oh well.. read it and weep.

327: "Struggle" by Knyttet.   How about a drug related short story?
Well, think about it at least. If you have been there, you might
recognize yourself. If not, it might make you think twice before
you say yes.

328: "A Man In Need" by Joseph.   If you want to read a strange story,
about some strange people, with a strange beginning and an even more
strange end, containing some strange arguments that you might understand,
though probably not, then this is a story made just for you.

329: "Under The Surface" by The GNN.   Like if you knew what freedom
means, imagine that someone, some day, comes up to you and completely
alters your view. Changes it to something so extreme, that you are
bound to agree, because it was really something you had never thought
of before!

330: "The Second uXu Quiz" by uXu.   Above all, what does really count?
Of course - yet another uXu Quiz with, frankly, too easy questions and
useful, carefully selected and expensive prizes to be won! You are right
Sir! So, read the file, send your answers to The GNN within fifteen days,
and you might just be one of our lucky winners!

331: "A Prayer For War" by Hedge.   Open up your eyes and take a look at
the wars going on right now, or the wars that have been. In general, we
detest war and love peace, right? So are those who start and fight these
wars completely crazy, or can a war actually be a good thing sometimes?

332: "Implants" by The Chief.   Think about the future. Think about the
fiction genre, books and movies. What is it that stands out from it all?
Implants. If it isn't perfect bodies, perfect appearences, it is computer
chip implants. Here is a view that might make you say "Plug in, drop out."

333: "One Step Forward, Two Back" by Joseph.   Questions questions
questions.. If you are interested in political questions, revolutions
or the ways the government controls everyone of us, this is probably
one text you do not want to miss.

334: "Bleed III" by The GNN.   Will the story never end!?, you might
ask yourself after learning that yet another part of the critically
acclaimed, often debated... computer game?! is out. But this is a
t-file group isn't it? Hmm, you better check this one out for
yourselves to make sure we're not doing something terrible!!

335: "Valentine's Day" by Knyttet.   Do you go around telling people
you care about, that you care about them? Do you tell the ones you love,
that you love them? Whenever you feel like it? Probably not. And that
is why you need to read this one.

336: "uXu Index #24" by The Chief.   Joda, here is the index again.
Still filled with information about the new release and still with
nifty information about the uXu sect and it's followers. What to do
to join, what to do to get out. Where you can find us, and where you
can not. What government agencies to contact in order to get rid of
us, and ... uh.. well. You know what to do!

            [#336 also includes an index for the uXu-S series]
