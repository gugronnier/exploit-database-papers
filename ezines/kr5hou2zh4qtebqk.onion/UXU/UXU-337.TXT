                                                  one: GUN STREET RAIN

   Now it's raining
   it is pouring;
   and it's just like yesterday;
   the cigarettes taste like iron,
   and the magician is a whore;
   dare devils do blue murder
   in the alley by the park
           don't wanna go any further
   but cannot face the sharks

   Now it's raining
   it is draining;
           and I never leave a trace;
   forget a face, no need to
   of the dare devils in the park;
           no, I've killed enough
      it is time, to let them breathe;
   but the face of the blue murderers
      lets me know just who I am

   She is singing
   my head is ringing
   section A is open again:
           for the sharks
   and the blue murderers
   in the alley by the park;
   reading, needing, finding
   what side to step on now;
   I will go with the blue murderers
      because they will tell me who I am

   Now it's raining
   it is pouring
   and it's just like yesterday;
   I killed with the blue murderers
   in the alley by the park,
   hauling ass and maiming time;
           kinda seen it all before;
   but now I'll love the singer
      because my mind is getting sore

   Doubts are spread
   in my mind
   facing them away
           I need to cramp the dare devils
      but the cracking was the core
   tracking down, the piece of heart
   I stashed in my brain;
   in favor for the gun street girl
      not waiting for the rain

                                                  two: RENEGADE CLUB

   down, down, down
   underground, tonight,
   playing with crooked
   cues, and a twisted car,
   hanging in the roof, see
   the sun pass the bar;
   in the renegade club, tonight

   in the colosseum, tonight
   green women and red water, down
   with the stream to the final
   exit; was that a sound?
   pass the card and the gun sight,
   stay away if you need to survive
   from the renegade club, tonight

   screaming men and quiet women
   guns dancing alone in the dark;
   in the colosseum, tonight;
   red rover, passing over, but
   need not to care: just diamonds,
   there are no exits, no doors
   to the renegade club, tonight

   the train paid us a visit
   leaving the usual tip, to
   the bartender, blowing his fuse;
   drinks taste like energy, indeed;
   the chimney opened the trap door, hey;
   the other floor; quick! to the unknown,
   away from the renegade club, tonight

                                                three: ON THE ROOF

    the man is killing his prey
   down on the burning streets;
        the dogs eat each other
    by the blue van down there,

                  and the cat burglar can see it all

   the lies are said with soiled fingers;
        the sweet sugar cube is listening
           but instead to something else;
         words are not heard by the prey,

                   yes, the cat burglar can hear it all

   whispering secrets to each other,
                 watched from above;
      the dogs must not hear a word,
   if they want to survive,

                   but the cat burglar knows it all

   the world is such a show to see,
             such a scream to hear,
          such a pain to encounter,
           but nothing to remember,

                   if you are not the burglar on the roof
                   if you are not the burglar above
                   everyone else

                                                  four: DEAD ZONE

   dark glasses and dark gun;
   no one has ever known him;
   no one knows his name;
   but he knows how to do it;
   do what everyone wants to do;

   explosion, flash and the end;
   drop dead, or drop down;
   rise, and scream, confusion;
   what happened on this street;
   who did what I want to do;

   no one stops by death;
   there is too much to see;
   better just pass by;
   and let bygones be bygones;
   death does what everyone wants;
   death does it all;

   what does it matter, a dream;
   we all know how it will end;
   people live and people die;
   but some just have it all;
   die like I want to die

                                                five: FINAL DISCOVERY

        rise!
                stand!
                        see!

   this is not what I wanted
   this is not what I expected
   everything to be

        learn!
                work!
                        life!

   is this what really I need
   is this how it really goes
   fuck you then

        slave!
                work!
                        die!

   show me the holy contract
   that I signed when
   I was born into this mess
   (just for trust)

                                                last: CRASH FORCE

   there is no answer to a trick question
   but man, if you fail you will taste
   the murder of truth and reality
   everything you know or everything
   you thought you knew will die below

   what shall I do and what should I say
   when the car of power stops by my side
   nothing to say nothing to do - damn
   when the wire is connected to my phone
   everything I know is that there will be

   beard of law, pale lips of knowledge
   elbow bent back and no one to cry
   walk this way, talk when I say
   wanna know why
        this floor is very slippery

                                                        next
