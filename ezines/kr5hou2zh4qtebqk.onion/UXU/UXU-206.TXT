                              "THE NIGHTFLY"
                      by THE GNN/DualCrew-Shining/uXu




  He  left  the secure ground at 2300 hours and headed for deep space.  His
space  ship  was  very  tight  due  to  the  fact  that  almost  the entire
two-passenger  cabin  was  as usual filled to the limit with his equipment.
The  planet  behind  him  became  smaller and smaller as he roared past the
moon.   A  pencil headed for the ceiling and he understood that he had left
the gravity zone.
  He checked the map and set the auto pilot for the neutral zone.  A police
robot  swept  past  him  and checked his passport.  No problems.  He leaned
back  in  the  seat  and watched the distant suns in front of him.  He knew
that  he  would  never  ever  make it so far, but that did not matter.  His
voice would soon be all over the universe and that was enough for him.
  The  engines suddenly stopped.  A few minutes later, the ship stood still
in  the  middle  of space.  He checked the map again and discovered that he
was  in the first sector of the neutral zone.  Excellent.  Time to rock and
roll.
  He  opened up his air compartments and heard the familiar sound of oxygen
being  pumped  into the cockpit.  He removed his helmet a couple of minutes
later  and  took  a deep breath.  He hummed on a little tune as his fingers
danced around on several buttons.  When he was almost done he hesitated for
a  while  before he pushed the final button.  A buzzing sound was heard and
the  gigantic  antenna on the roof was extended.  Everything had worked out
fine.   He  pulled  down  the  microphone  from  the roof and turned on his
computer terminal.  A few commands and his cabin drowned in soft music.
  The Nightfly was on the air.
  "The  time  is  2400  hours  central  european Earth time and this is the
Nightfly  speaking  to you from the solar system's neutral zone!  I will be
here  for  six  hours to entertain you, so do not leave!  But first, let us
listen to the latest hit from the Alpha Centauri Camp."


  kill, maim, destroy
  we love to do it
  we do it all the time
  it is fun
  real fun
  kill, kill, kill                                                (I)


  The  music  was  really  hardcore  -  the only thing that could be heard,
except for the violent song, was magnificent heavy drums that could kill an
elephant  together with some strange bleeping sounds.  The Nightfly did not
actually  like  the music, but he had to play it anyway to amuse some other
parts  of  the  universe.  The Alpha Centauri Camp had complained about him
never  playing  the kind of music they listened too.  He seldom cared about
what  other  creatures  on  other planets liked to hear since there existed
enough styles of music to keep him busy for several decades.
  When  the  tune  was  finished,  he  leaned  forward  and  spoke into the
microphone.
  "Time  for  Nightfly Facts!  There are three steps in human understanding
of  his own life!  The first step; The Mob Step.  Life is work.  The second
step;   The   agony  step.   Life  must  be  more  than  just  work.   This
understanding  leaves  the  human in pain, since she cannot understand what
the  meaning  of  life  is.   The third (and final) step; The understanding
step.   Life  is  work for most people, but one just have to play the game,
eat  the  cake  and  suck  out the fun of life before it is too late!  (*).
Cool  ey?  And now; the peoples corner is open!  Call and let your voice be
heard all over the universe!  The number is..."
  Then he turned on some new music.  This time he played some Marsian dance
music that was actually quite enjoyable.


  whatever you do
  and whatever you are
  you can always go
  to Mars and dance
  gravitation is cool
  the men are proud
  and the women are hot
  so come to Mars and dance                                        (II)


  "We  have  a  caller!  It is Mike from the Sun of Freedom Republic!  What
have  got  to say Mike to the people and the creatures and the souls of our
universe?"
  Mike  was a creature that did not speak with sounds.  Therefor, he used a
phone  that  translated  his  leg movements into sounds, which ended up his
voice rather metallic.
  "I like music.  I like the Nightfly.  I like to listen to the Nightfly."
  "Thanks  Mike!  Say, what do you think about the new racist movement that
have emerged from nowhere on your planet?"
  "Stupid.  Uneducated."
  "You  are right about that, Mike.  Now we have Michelle from Earth on the
line!"
  A young female voice came to life.
  "Hi, Nighty!  I love you!  I want you!  I want to make lo..."
  Click.
  "Thanks Michelle!  Now for some more music."
  He  played  some funky Phobos music and thought about how many calls from
weirdos he had received during the two years he had been transmitting.


  yeah yeah yeah yeah
  yeah yeah yeah yeah
  Phobos says yeah
  yeah yeah yeah


  While  the music played the Nightfly lighted a cigarette.  He watched the
grey  smoke  and  sighed.   Even tough he really enjoyed his hobby he still
could  not  relax properly when on the air.  No one knew who he was, no one
had  ever seen him.  He was the only Nightfly, the criminal dude who once a
week  gave  the  universe  what  they wanted to listen to.  What he did was
illegal, but since he was in a neutral zone no one could really arrest him.
Yet.   It  was  just  a  question of time before the governments united and
decided to invent some new law that would lead to his arrest, he thought.
  A  sudden  anger  made him lower the volume in the middle of the tune and
scream:  "Free radio!  We need more stations like mine!  Revolution!"
  The tune continued and he felt free.  He knew that he was privileged.


  Phobos says yeah
  yeah yeah yeah...                                                (III)


  "...  and Nightfly says yeah too!"
  Very  few  people  had  the  money and the knowledge about how to open up
their personal radio station.  The Nightfly had used parts of a inheritance
to  buy  the  necessary  equipment for his station.  He loved it, and would
keep on playing music and talking bullshit for long as he lived.
  "Want to hear the latest gossip folks?  Heh heh...  you know the infamous
police  man  Stephen Crownbranch who dedicated his life to nail all hackers
and  virus  makers around the universe?  You know, just after he had busted
three  members  of the Galactic Hackers Association he suddenly disappeared
from  the  law  force.   No one know where he is.  But I know!  The guys in
G.H.A told him that they were going to get him and sure they did.  But they
struck back in a completely unexpected way.  They did not hack his computer
not  did they send him some killing computer virus.  They did not empty his
bank  account  nor  did  they  spread  any  filthy rumors about him via the
networks.   Poor  old  Stephen had fifty computer experts who helped him to
feel  secure.   So I guess he felt rather surprised when the guys in G.H.A,
the  little  nerds  with glasses and bad breathes, showed up with a handgun
and  blew  his  brain away with two rounds of hot steel.  Yep, murdered him
for  real,  not electronically.  Way to go, G.H.A.  Hackers are heroes.  No
doubts about that, I can assure you!  So!  It is time to rock this universe
with  a  political  discussion!   Tonight's  topic  will be; why do the mad
dictator  Clex Mankler keep on living?  Should someone zap him to dust with
a  laser  cannon  or  is  economical  aid  to  the rebels be enough?  Music
maestro!  The Killing Game by Force Crew;"


  he was a dare devil
  he was a mercenary
  never had a good life
  only knew how to shoot
  I tell you this
  do not mess with the
  mercenary man
  from the stars                                                   (IV)


  "Speak Yggrasil!"
  "First of all, I would like to thank the Nightfly for his great work!"
  "Thanks..."
  "About Clex Mankler...  Yes!  I think someone ought to blow away a couple
of  his  heads!   That  piece of selfish shit have ruined the lives of many
poor  inhabitants  on Planet Q!  I cannot understand why no one shoots him!
Personally, I would use a Magma Three and stick it up his..."
  "Er...   what do you think about the fact that he will be able to vote in
the next Galactic Meeting on Phobos?"
  "It sucks!  It is outrageous!  He is a madman!"
  The Nightfly disconnected his caller.
  "Thanks  Yggrasil!   I am sure that you are not the only one to have that
kind  of  feelings!  Speaking about madmen, last week a young man in a city
called Phalun on planet Earth savagely killed seven people with a automatic
weapon (**).  I guess no one missed that.  Apparently his mind snapped when
his  girl friend told him to fuck off or something..  well, I do not really
know  the details behind his great rage.  The man was a officer in the army
and  could  easily  lay  his  hands on several weapons that he used for his
personal  retaliation.  I could say something about how awful it is that no
one stopped him in time or I could demand the army to keep their weapons in
a  safer  place in the future.  But I will not do that.  I mean, why should
I?   The  young  man  who killed seven people ought to be treated as a hero
down on Earth.  Because he showed the world that they have a good army with
people  who  knows  how to do the work.  Why do they keep on saying that he
killed  seven 'innocent people'?  He was employed by the army.  His work is
to learn people to kill, main and 'protect' the country from 'enemies'.
  I  never  forget  the  face of one guy who claimed that he felt bad about
what had happened.  He was dressed in army clothes and had his family close
to  him  when  the  media  interviewed  him.   He  wanted to go home.  This
pathetic guy really pissed me off.  He also worked for the army, as the man
who  murdered  seven people did.  So why did he feel bad?  Why?  The killer
just  showed  the  world  that their weapons works perfect, that their fine
automatic  weapons  can  kill  and maim people.  That is what they are for.
So,  this  guy  who  'felt  bad and wanted to home' I just want to know the
following  facts;  when  your department of justice decides that it is time
for  war  you must kill and maim people anyway.  You will have to kill more
than  seven  people  to  survive,  I  tell  you  that.   So use this golden
opportunity  to  learn how that will feel.  You will not have the slightest
chance  to 'feel bad' and 'go home' then.  You must kill, you must use your
weapon to blow other peoples body parts away.  Get used to it.
  "Now, a short break for the one o'clock news."


  Welcome to Galactic News.  My name is Jon Andersson.
  Today, the president of the United States on planet Earth decided to wipe
out  the  Freedom  Colony  on the first moon.  Many people are disappointed
with  the  president  and  says  that  he  should  not  have  used military
force...blah  blah.   Alpha  Centauri  suffers  from  one of the worst fire
storms  in  history.   The  reason  seems  to  be the increasing numbers of
smokers...blah   blah.   Promixia  Delta  has  been  sucked  into  a  black
hole...blah  blah.   Another war...blah blah.  Yet another war...blah blah.
The results from the Space Race...blah blah The weather...blah blah
  Good night or good morning, depending on where you are...


  "I am the Nightfly, and you are listening to me!  Now..."
  A  loud  crash  could  be  heard.   He  froze.   Something  had happened.
Quickly,  he  brought  up the status screen and discovered that an asteroid
had broken one of his wheels.  He cursed himself for forgetting to pull the
wheels  up  when he had left the planet.  But the damage was not especially
serious.  He just had to land very carefully when he got back.
  "Sorry  about  this little break.  I just discovered that a bunch of kids
tried  to  steal my purse.  Ha ha ha...  You know what?  This world must be
destroyed.   We have lost all our feelings for the human race, the creature
race  and the soul manager race.  All cultures that I know do only want one
thing.   Money  and material.  What happened to the old days, the so-called
'dark  ages', when God was divine and humble people believed that they were
only  a  small  part  of a complex but rational order?  It vanished and was
replaced  with  a  thirst  for  personal benefit.  No one cares about other
people,  the  only  thing  that  matters is the success and the short cuts.
Start  the  body count.  Sure, I am a cynic.  This world must be destroyed.
Now for the number one hit!  Kiss My Oxygen Tank with the Plausible Heroes!
Hit 'em boys!"


  kiss my steel tank and feel the air
  sweep through your lungs
  you know I care
  baby, I do not want you to suffocate
  I love you more than the sun
  so come on
  kiss my steel tank                                                 (V)


  His  phone  rang and he picked it up from the other seat.  A female voice
spoke to him with a soft voice.
  "Hi  Nightfly.   I  would  like to talk about that Clex Mankler dude.  It
that okay?  My name is Cath by the way."
  "Of course!" he answered.  "Hold on a while."
  He turned off the music and grabbed the microphone.
  "Now  we got Cath from...  uh...  somewhere!  Let us hear what you got to
say to the public Cath!"
  "About  this  Clex fella...  uh...  I think he really is an idiot.  And..
uh..  uh..."
  He had to help her.
  "Is there something special you dislike with him?"
  "Yes!   Uh...   he  is SO GOD DAMN UGLY!  HE LOOKS LIKE A GOD DAMN PRICK!
FUCK HIM!  IF I HAD THE CHANCE I WOULD FOR SURE..."
  "Thanks  Cath.   But  do  remember that we have the freedom of speech, so
just watch what you say."
  Click.
  "You  are still listening to the Nightfly.  People, when I sit here in my
ship  I  feel rather lonely, let me tell you that.  I can see the twinkling
stars  and  the planets, but they are so far away from me that it is almost
hard  to  believe.   And  when I look at the planets from a closer distance
with  the  zoom-scope I feel the same feeling.  Because I cannot see people
unless I land on a planet, and the lack of people makes a man feel alone.
  But  when  I  look  at the planets I notice something else.  They look so
peaceful  and  comfortable  from  a  long range distance.  I cannot see any
people, I cannot see any wars.  I cannot hear political discussions nor can
I  see  violence  and misery.  I can only see the huge terrestial body that
floats  around  in  space.   I cannot see people.  The ones responsible for
everything  bad  are  people.   People  never  do  anything good, they just
destroy  what  is  in their way.  I am a part of those people, I know that.
So, sometimes I love this feeling of being alone in space.
  I like to sir here alone and watch the planets and the stars.  Everything
looks so beautiful from here."
  He paused for a while before he continued.
  "Now  I think it is time to talk about personal relations!  Call Nightfly
if  you  got  any  problems  with  life, love or whatever!  I will be right
back!"

  "That was Raven Family from planet Earth with the tune 'Does not somebody
want  to  be  wanted'.   Not very intelligent tune, but good if you want to
dance!   Something  that  bugs  me is that it is told by many that space is
endless.  Because if it were not endless, there must be a wall or something
at  the  end  of  the  universe.  And what would be behind that wall?  More
space.  Hence, space must be endless.
  Personally,  I  do  not  think that space is endless.  Because if it were
endless,  where  would  it end?  Where should we place the last gas station
before  we  put  up  the sign 'Here begins the endless space.  Have you got
enough gasoline?'
  Now I would like to welcome Ralph from Bay City on Planet XI.  What would
you like to talk about Ralph?"
  "Well,  you see...  I have a girl friend from another planet.  Planet XII
to  be  precise.   And with this new law that forbids youngsters from other
planets to make love to people from here...  well..."
  "I see!  So you are not able to meet each other any more?"
  "No.  I cannot even travel to that planet any more."
  "Let  me tell you this Ralph; shout for revolution, get guns and blow the
suckers away who invented this law!"
  "Right!  You got it!  Thanks and good bye, Nighty!"
  Click.
  "Oh,  did  it  not  feel  nice  to  be  the  spark  that  lighted another
revolutionary  fire?   I  tell  you  this  people; actions talks - bullshit
rules.   We  have to work for what we want.  But work does not only have to
be physical action, it can be everything from words on paper to brief chats
in  the  middle  of the night.  Of course, oppressed people have little use
for  big  mouths that cannot reveal anything particular about the problems,
but  those who got the talent to speak...  speak!  Now for the next caller!
We got Hegel from Earth!  Speak!"
  "Hello, it is nice to..."
  The  voice  suddenly  disappeared.   Buzz.   Nightfly  knocked  the phone
against  the  dashboard in a try to get Hegel back.  A voice came back, but
it was not the one who called himself Hegel.  Someone had connected himself
to his phone line.  Someone special.
  "Listen  Nightfly!  This is commander Lick, chief commander on the Queens
primary destroyer, who speaks!  We are close to you and do you know what we
will do?"
  The Nightfly sighed and lighted another cigarette.
  "Say hello?  Buy me some candy?  How should I know?"
  "We are going to blow you into nothing you criminal!  We..."
  "Sorry, but you cannot do that.  I am in a neutral zone and..."
  "Not  any  more!  The government on planet Earth decided to move the zone
six  blocks away!  So if you do not find a way to move to that area in less
than three minutes, you are history!  Pirate radio station!  (Belch) We are
going to get you!"
  Smart  move,  really  smart  move.   Nightfly  hung  up and turned on his
engines  immediately.   He did not know if the guy was lying or not, but he
did  not  want  to  find  out.   Quickly  he  accelerated  into space.  The
cigarette  between his lips jumped out of his mouth due to the sudden speed
and  landed  on the floor.  Nightfly desperately reached for it and did not
see  that  he  actually headed for a well-known black hole.  When he raised
his head he discovered the hole, but it was way too late and he was


  sucked in
  into the black hole
  do be do be do be do                                              (VII)


  'The Nightfly is gone' by Section Z.
  However,  sometimes  young  and  old  people  still  lean back into their
chairs,  gathers giggling around radios, happily turn on receivers in their
cars  or  space  crafts,  and  enjoys a night of truths and galactic music.
Because some people still claim that if you aim your antenna at the Seventh
Heaven  black hole and tune your radio to a certain frequency you will hear
the familiar and beloved voice again.
  "I am the Nightfly and you are listening to me!"
