                             THE CAN AND THE FUTURE
                        by THE GNN/DualCrew-Shining/uXu


The stocky little salesman smiled and watched me closely as I made my way
around in his tiny shop. I looked for something that I had searched for a
long time now.
   "Good morning, Sir," he said and revealed a strange accent. "How are you
doing today?"
   "Oh, just fine, thank you" I lied with a merry voice.
   My eyes fell on a metal can behind the counter. The salesman immediately
noticed my interest.
   "Are you interested in buying... The Can?" he asked.
   "What does it contain?" I asked.
   "Whatever you want it to contain."
   Excellent. I had found what I had been looking for.
   "How much does it cost?"
   "Whatever you want it to cost."
   I realized that I was in a hurry. If I did not buy The Can at once,
someone else would steal it from me. And I had no intention to let that
happen.
   I told the salesman what I wanted to pay. I must admit that it was a
terrible losing price. But he did not stop smiling.
   "And... its content?" he asked.
   "The future."
   "A good choice."
   I brought up my wallet and paid the man. Then I rushed home. I held The
Can in a firm grip, afraid that someone would snatch the precious object from
me.
   As soon as I had closed the door to my home behind me, I began working
with The Can. Slowly, I opened it while I wondered what I was going to look
for. The thoughts danced around in my head. Where to find the winning ticket
to next week's lottery? Tomorrow's news? A sneak preview of my future
partners?
   But I quickly forgot those humble dreams. All my plans went down the
misery drain; The Can was empty.
