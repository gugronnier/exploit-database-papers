  Let's say hello to life!
  Let in life in your soul.
  Let's find a purpose with our life
  Let's fill every day with a "mission".

  If you, every single day in your life, get out of bed thinking that today
  I'm going to make someone happy. And if you and you and everyone was
  thinking like this. Wow. This world would be a better place to live in.
  I can see that you are thinking "what can I do". Sure that's what
  everyone is thinking. But someone will have to start, and why not you?

  On our way from birth to death, we meet a lot of people. Some of them
  we dislike, some of them we love. Take care of all the nice moments,
  all the meetings that are filled with love and joy. Bring them into
  your heart and keep them there, so they can warm you up in frozen
  moments.

  Don't be afraid of people, they are not as dangerous as they look. And
  all of us do have a lot in common, we are human, we live here and now.
  We can't stay forever in the arms of our mothers. If you don't want to
  see and understand, and grow by yourself, there will come a time when
  life will force you. Spiritual growth happens anywhere, where there is
  consciousness.

  There are a lot of quiet people out there in the world. Maybe they are
  quiet just because there is no one out there listening to them. Why
  can't we all try to be the one who listens? Why can't we be the ones
  who give feedback?  There already are enough quiet people, because
  of the reason I mentioned. Try to help each other in making this world a
  better place to live in. Make it a world where we can raise our children
  without fear about all the things that parents of today are worried
  about. And let's start today.

  If you think like everyone else, nothing's going to happen, that's for
  sure. I don't think this is a "cure" for everything bad in this world,
  even though I do have blue eyes. I just think that this is a way to do
  good things, to let good thoughts out and spread them around. Because a
  little more love in this world wouldn't do any harm, would it?
