Even though all technology needed is available, modern science has yet not
been able to reduce 'emotions' to physical states in the brain with the
clarity and precision needed for proving their objective existence. Due to
this, we have no clear definition of the phenomenon 'emotions' and ought
therefore (in accordance with the scientific method) conclude that they do
not exist. This conclusion, however, does not entail a demand for apathy.
Thanks to the latest research by the pioneer of medical chemistry at the
uXu lab, we are proud to present to you the final solution:


                               < P I L L S >

                           invented and abused by
                                The GNN, M.D.

   <The Aware Pill>  Put this wonderful piece of chemistry into your
   body and you will soon fully grasp the Cartesian meaning of cogito
   ergo sum. Yes, forget the hard work of filling your tabula rasa
   with meaningless experiences just for the sake of understanding the
   notion of 'I'. This pill will get you down to business of seeing
   yourself as a separate part of the world.


   <The Love Pill>  For economical and social purposes it is often
   necessary to engage in certain interpersonal relations of the
   monogamous form. With the help of this wonderful drug, you need
   not waste expensive time tracking down that particular person your
   selfish genes finds acceptable as a reproduction partner. Consume
   the Love Pill with a friend, and all your problems on this matter
   will be solved.


   <The Sex Pill>  What can be more revolting than using the sewer
   system of your body for gruesome physical activity with your
   equally filthy partner? (Rhetorical question, no answer expected.)
   Nothing. But with together with this pill, you will actually
   experience this dirty activity as 'wonderful' - believe it or not!


   <The Anti-Love Pill>  For economical and social purposes it is often
   necessary to stall certain interpersonal relations of the monogamous
   form. Forget anxiety, depression and the seemingly endless fights
   through the night. With this pill, you and the devil reincarnated
   you have married can break up without actually speaking to each
   other.


   <The Work Pill>  The industrial revolution left mankind with quite
   a bunch of tiresome, barbarous, pointless and generally quite boring
   occupations. But now! Forget self-deception! Forget alienation! Just
   eat this little product, and work will never be the same again. In
   no time, empty sentences like 'I love my job', 'I have great
   workmates' and 'I really feel that I am doing something important'
   will flood out of your mouth whenever someone dares to question your
   socially accepted waste of life.


   <The Creativity Pill>  This magic portion will give you all the
   inspiration you need to create works of art. Forget sleepless nights
   trying to come up with a good short story, screenplay, novel, tune,
   symphony, painting, poem, whatever. Just consume this little
   medication and experience how knowledge, wit and inspiration crashes
   into your empty mind. This is probably the most popular pill of them
   all, believe me. I am on it right now.


   <The Fun Pill>  Sometimes, we all need to let loose of our primitive
   feelings down at some bar or discotheque. Unfortunately, this is
   virtually impossible due to our inability to clearly define what
   this thing called 'fun' is. But with this you-know-what, it is not
   impossible anymore! (Please note: this pill was formerly known as
   d-lysergic acid N,N-diethyl amide; United States Patent Office,
   no. 2,736,728; patented February 1956; patent owned by The Albert
   Hoffman Foundation.)


   <The Final Pill>  For economical, social and genetical purposes it
   is sooner or later necessary to put an end to all of your problems.
   Get ready for the final ride! Throw this little thing down your
   throat, wait a couple of minutes, and suddenly - like magic - it is
   all over!
