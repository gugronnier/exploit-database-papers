                               Loved anyhow


  Sometimes I wonder why people around me have such trouble realizing that
  they can be loved even though someone sometimes screams at them?
  I wonder if they never argue with the ones they love and care for?
  I really wonder how they are raising their children?

  Why can't people come to the conclusion that it's possible to be loved
  even though they are not perfect? Cause who is perfect? God?
  Why are we so afraid of not being loved?
  Why do we always try to please everyone?

  Is it something we learned from our parents?
  "Don't do this and don't do that because if you do, mummy, daddy, grandma
  etc. will be sad" - and in the brain of the kid, that becomes the same as
  - stop loving you.
  Is that something we carry with us, deep inside in our subconsciousness?
  If you think hard, if you think logically, does everyone have to love you?
  Do you love everyone?
  Are you unhappy if you don't?

  Why can't people just see the facts - we don't have to be loved by
  everyone?
  Maybe it is our "enemies" that make us grow?
  Maybe that anger that we sometimes feel when someone is unfair to us is
  good for us?
  Maybe it helps us to think?
  Maybe that is what the bible means by "Love your enemies as yourself"?
  Cause there is something good about them, if we are smart enough to use
  our anger in a creative way.

  Try to have this in mind the next time you start, or someone else starts
  to argue.
  I think it will help.
  And try to teach your children, so they don't grow up and live their whole
  life trying to please everyone they meet. Just as we did.
