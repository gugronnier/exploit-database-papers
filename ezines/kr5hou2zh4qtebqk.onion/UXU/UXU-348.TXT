  Working part-time as a teacher in the academy. Crawling the cracks.
Practices performative hermeneutics, scratch-derrida, shuffles an electronic
card system, a 3d concept matrix, a looped tape, a non-representational movie
with strange atemporal rhythm projected onto the back wall, weird anamorphic
distortions from the overspill on the side walls and ceiling.


  sits down to write. bitten by an insect with a grooved metal tongue, slaps
it away, lapses into unconsciousness, dreaming jade green tangle of vegetable
matter, irresistible gravitation towards tangible biomass, immediately
implicated in the placeness of this strange space. aberration in the field
of vision, dissolving into eddies of infinite regress at the edges,
disorientation, epileptic seizure, coma, death.

                                        *****

  It is a grey room, ordered arrays of tools. A tray of knives: a post-mortem
knife, a cartilage knife, a seven inch brain knife. Another tray with sets
of both blunt and sharp pointed surgical scissors. A trolley, scalpel and
dissection forceps, grooved director and a probe, some bone forceps, and a
small butcher's saw. On a stainless steel bench a chisel and mallet, scales
and weights, a set of measuring cylinders, bacteriological requisites for
taking smears and cultures, fixing solution (used for perceiving specimens),
needles, thread, sponges and tow, sawdust, a single white kneecap.

  The body white on the slab. It had still been warm when it was brought in,
but its muscles were slowly stiffening, starting with the jaw, spreading
outwards to the limbs. A man is standing on the right side of the body. He
reaches down with his left hand and extends the chin, entering the knife
just above the prominence of the thyroid cartilage. He makes an incision
down to the pubes. In the neck, he divides the skin and subcutaneous
tissue. Over the sternum, the incision goes down to the bone. The abdomen
is cautiously opened, and he gags at the foul smelling gas that escapes
from the peritoneal cavity into the lower pressure of the room. Pausing,
then retracting the edges of the wound, scraping back the skin with a
scalpel, securing the excess to the slab with steel pins. All the while
making notes to a terminal, an electric eye in the ceiling records the
dissection.
