You have all probably heard Bob Dylan sing "The answer my friend, is blowing
in the wind", but have you ever given the song a second thought?
Almost everywhere, there is a wind blowing. Outside, the wind is blowing in
the trees. Inside, the wind is coming from the air conditioning. Still,
everywhere, there is a wind blowing. Even if it's not blowing, it's there,
surrounding you.
You can't escape it.

It's not only Dylan that has been writing songs about answers in the wind,
I can come up with a lot of others that in some way is mentioning the wind as
the one with answers.
So that might be it. The wind sneaks into your head, through your ears,
nose, eyes and mouth, seeks out what it wants to find and takes your thoughts
when it leaves.

How often doesn't it happen that you start thinking of a person you haven't
seen in years and, whoops, just around the corner you meet that person.
Could it be possible for the wind to both take and sometimes leave
information in our heads?
Could it be the wind that send you a premonition of who you were going to
meet around the corner?
Could it be possible that it's the same wind that's been blowing on the
earth since God created it? That it's the same wind from millions and
millions of years ago, that blows around the earth.
Could that be one of the explanations about people that believe they had
a life before the life they are living now?
Could it be possible that the ever blowing wind dropped quite a lot of
information in just that person's head about something that happened a long
time ago or about another place?
Could that be why people sometimes feels like they've been in new places
before?

I don't believe that the wind has a consciousness about this claimed ability.
I don't think it leaves, or loses information on purpose.
I just think this is something that happens, by coincidence, and that some
people are more prone to notice.
I'm not trying to prove anything, I don't want to convince you. I just want
to give this theory some thoughts, so the wind gets something the next time
it sneaks into your head.
