   Perhaps  you think you know something about beer. Well,  you
don't but that is nothing to worry about because in this file I
will tell you everything about good beer. You see, in the US of
A  there  is as far as I know only one beer that really deserve
to  be  called beer, that is Anchor Steam Beer that is made  in
San  Francisco.  Yes, I have tried Michelob,  Slitz  and  quite
frankly they are nothing more than dirty water. I've also tried
the American Budweiser (it's more like Budwasser really) and it
was so bad I had to put in some Young's Oatmeal Stout to get it
down. It's amazing how much better the original Czechoslovakian
Budvar is.


HISTORY

   Now, let's start at the beginning. Perhaps you think beer is
something that is quite new. Wrong! That is just something  the
wine  snobs want you to think. In fact beer is probably one  of
the  oldest  beverages known to man.  We know for a  fact  that
beer has been known for over 7000 years. People like the sumers
and  Babylonians knew about beer, the pharaohs also knew  about
beer.  For  more  than  2000  years  ago  the  centre  of  beer
production  moved from the Eufrat/Tigris-area (in modern  Iraq)
to  the  Nile and northern Europe. In those days the  beer  was
quite dark, often sweet and spiced with herbs and honey.

   In  the 15th century a beer revolution started! It began  in
Germany, Bavaria to be exact. Then they started flavouring  the
beer with hops and developed a new fermentation method, the  so
called bottom fermentation. They had discovered that in  a  low
temperature  another type of yeast was encouraged that  gave  a
different  beer. This new beer with strong taste of hops  could
be stored and then it got more carbonated and greater aroma. In
Germany it got the name "lager", a name which lives even today.

   The method with bottom fermenting became more widely popular
in  the  19th century when artificial cooling techniques became
available.  The bottom fermented beer was lighter  and  clearer
than the top fermented which often had yeast sediment.


QUALITY

   A beer don't get better with more alcohol. The quality is  a
result  of  the  balance between malt and hops, the  foam  that
comes  from  long storage, the fresh smell and the colour.  The
ingredients  are  also  of  vital importance  as  well  as  the
procedure  of  making. A beer should only be  made  with  malt,
hops,  yeast and fresh water  preferably spring water), nothing
else  (unless  it's some kind of special beer like  oatmeal  or
cherry beer). Some breweries cheat and add all sorts of cheaper
ingredients  like maize, sugar, ascorbic acid and  so  on.  But
this  of course gives a "beer" with a much lower class, in some
countries it's not even allowed to call it beer or to  sell  it
as such.


THE MAKING OF BEER

   As  mentioned above the ingredients of beer are  malt  (from
barley), water, yeast and hops.

  In the making of beer you use barley that have a high rate of
starch.   A  good  water  for beer  should  be  soft.  The  old
breweries were built close to springs of brooks that were known
to  have soft, clear water. The yeast is also important.  Yeast
is  a  fungus that are everywhere in nature.  To be comfortable
and  start  working it needs  warmth and sugar.  The  two  main
types of beer is top fermented and bottom fermented. The choice
of yeast type is important. The yeast not only convert sugar to
alcohol  - it also gives the beer it's flavour. Every  type  of
yeast gives a different type of beer.

   Hops is an up to six meter high wine. The female plants have
spikes  that  looks  like cones. They  contains   cridous  (not
acid),  aromatic oils and tanning agents. The hops are used  in
beer to with it's bitter taste give balance to the sweetness of
the  malt. It also gives better tenability and a clearer  beer.
Hop  cones  are dried before they are used to make beer.  There
are  several  different hops and every one gives  it's  special
aroma and bitterness to the beer.

   Now, let's get to the actual making of the beer! Before  the
barley  can  be  used it must be malted. This  happens  in  the
maltery.  The  barley are being wet with  water  and  are  then
allowed  to  lie in a warm place to sprout. It is then  roasted
usually  with hot air (about 70 centigrades), how  hard  it  is
roasted determines the darkness of the beer. The roasted barley
is  called  malt. The malt is then crushed and mixed  with  hot
water  (50-80 centigrades) to produce mash which contains  malt
sugar.  The  mash is filtered and you get the sweet wort  which
basically  is  sugar and water. The sweet wort is  boiled  with
hops to make the final wort with the typical bitter taste.  The
wort  is  then fermented for about two weeks and is  turned  to
beer.  To mature the beer is stored at a low temperature for  a
couple  of  weeks. After that it may be filtered  and  is  then
ready to be enjoyed.


HOW TO DRINK BEER

   Of course you can just grab a beer and drink it as it is but
if you want to get maximum enjoyment from it you should be more
careful.
   A beer should be served cool, 6-8 centigrades for light beer
and  higher  the  darker it is. When you pour  the  beer  first
directly into the glass and then fill up slowly, a little  each
time  and  let  it settle between the times to produce  a  good
head. Grab the beer, study it. What it the colour? Does it have
yeast  sediment?  Smell it! Spin the glass gently  and  put  it
under your nose. The smell of a beer can say more about a  beer
than  the flavour. Take a sip. Let the beer roll on the tongue.
And  then  swallow  in a couple of gulps. First  you  feel  the
sweetness  on the top of the tongue, then there is a  fireworks
of  different  flavours.  Aromatic,  fruity...  When  you  have
swallowed  comes the aftertaste. It can be light  or  "maltey",
rich  or not, more or less bitter. A good aftertaste must  make
you want to have another go.


AFTERWORDS

   I  hoped this has served as an introduction to what beer  is
all  about. This is only to be seen as a very simple first step
for  greater understanding of the noble art of beer and I  hope
it has inspired you to go on and continue to study the subject.

Cheers!
