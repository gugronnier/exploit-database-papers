                                  "REEL"
                      by THE GNN/DualCrew-Shining/uXu




  The light fades, hard white light, and finally the film begins.
  He  walks  towards the old white house that is surrounded by a green lawn
and  a  frame  of red roses.  Blue sky, hot sun and not a single cloud.  He
hesitates  by the dark wooden door.  Then he reaches for the bell and rocks
the small rope beneath it.
  The  door  opens  and a beautiful young girl appears.  Her name is Julia.
She  examines  the well-dressed boy in front of her, who carries a red rose
in his hand.  She is just about  to  ask  why he is here,  when he suddenly
turns around  and runs away.  He drops the rose on the lawn right before he
jumps over the hedge and disappears down the hot street.
  End of reel.
  The man in the red sofa sighed.
  "Not good, not good at all..." he mumbled.  "Worthless, actually."
  This  part  of  the  film  had to be edited.  Back to the tight dark room
right next to the movie theater.
  He placed the reel into the machine and played it again - frame by frame.
  towards-the-old-white-house...
  So far, so good.  He knew when he should cut.
  suddenly-turned-around-and-ran-away...
  Cut!
  Stupid part.  He removed the sequence from the film and threw it into the
thrashcan  beneath  the  table.   While leaning back into the uncomfortable
chair,  he  thought  for  a  while  while sucking on his pipe.  After a few
minutes he knew what he wanted.
  The light fades, hard white light, and the films begins.
  "Hi sweetie,  I  am  John.   You  might  remember  me.  We go to the same
school."
  The girl next to the dark wooden door looked at him with cheerful eyes.
  "Yes," she said with a happy voice.  "I do remember you!"
  Short moment of comfortable silence.  "What are you doing here, John?"
  He  did not answer her question.  With a steady hand, he gave her the red
rose.  "For you."
  "For me?"
  He smiled and nodded.  She took it and looked confused, but still happy.
  "Oh, sorry!" she said.  "Please, come in."
  End of reel.
  Excellent!   Perfect!   He slapped the hand on his knee and did thumbs up
to the screen that now only presented hard white light.
  Back to the dark room.  This time he grabbed reel nineteen eighty-six.
  The film begins.
  Holding hands, Julia and John  walking  down a rainy  street.  People who
cover their heads run past them and into taxis and shelter.  But the two of
them just walk there. The rain does not bother them. Their love is stronger
than  ever,  something  that  may  have  to do with the fact that they just
injected a dose of heroine into their veins.  Someone...
  Cut!  For christ sake, cut!
  The words echoed in the small movie theater.  White light.
  He replaced the rain with a sun.  No drugs, just love.  The final version
showed  two  young happy people who walked on a happy street, hand in hand,
on their way to the beach.
  The  beach?  No.  Did not work.  Not in the middle of a city.  He thought
again.
  on-their-way-to-the-ice-cream-man...
  Much better.
  "What  now?"  he said to himself and let his eyes wander through the huge
collection of reels.
  "1972.  Birth and childhood."
  "1989.  Education at West High."
  Finally he saw what he wanted.
  "1999.  Marriage."
  He  placed the reel into the projector, turned it on and quickly ran down
the stairs to his red sofa.
  The film begins.
  Completely  drunk, John manages to say 'yes' to his bride.  Then he turns
to  the  priest.   He looks like he is about to say something, but the only
thing that occurs is that John vomits all over...
  Cut!  Shit!  Cut!  Cut!
  When  he  was  finished  the white wedding  was lovely.  He began to feel
satisfied with his work.  But something was missing.
  "2030.  Death."
  He trembled as the film began.
  John  plays  football  with his son in the garden.  A storm is closing in
from the west.
  "Maybe  we  should  go  inside",  John says but his son insists that they
should play for five more minutes.
  John  watches the dark clouds in the sky and ponders about their content.
The  answer is delivered to him at once.  A flash of lightning emerges from
the sky and strikes him.  He dies.  His son slowly walks towards him.
  Cut.
  "What a boring way to die...", the man in the red sofa muttered.  "I have
to change this."
  A  few minutes later he discovered that the part could not be edited.  It
was  against the rules.  Death is absolute and cannot be changed.  He tried
over and over again but nothing happened.
  he dies-click
  he dies-click
  He  was not able to edit this part.  With a deep sigh, he played the film
forward.   He saw his son walk towards his dead body, scream and run inside
to get Julia.  She did not know what to do, so she called the police and an
ambulance.  But nothing could be done.  He was dead and gone.
  "Gone to this place..." he said with a low voice.
  Then  he  played the film forward again.  He saw his funeral.  Depressing
part, mostly because all of his friends were there at once and he could not
speak to them.
  Forward.
  Julia dies and leaves their son alone in the world.
  Forward.
  Their son works in a bank.
  "What?"  he  screamed and looked at the small screen on the edit-machine.
In  a  bank?   Ridiculous!   His  son really deserved something better.  He
wanted  to change the film into a version were his son works as a well-paid
author,  writing  success-stories  for a hungry mass.  Impossible.  Nothing
after own death could be altered.
  He  left  the reel in the machine and pushed the fast forward button.  He
watched for hours and wondered why he had not done this before.  He saw the
world  change,  people  being  born and people who died.  He saw continents
move  on the seven seas, bump into each other and form new countries.  War,
destruction, people being born, people dying, earth spinning.  Stars in the
sky disappear, appear, disappear.
  "This  must  surely  be  against  the  rules" he thought.  But he kept on
watching while increasing the speed on the fast forward.
  Earth died and so did the entire universe.
  End of reel.  There was nothing more to see.
