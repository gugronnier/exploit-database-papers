                       The invasion



A very long time ago, all life on a special planet, somewhere in the
universe, were simple. Where there were life, it existed without being
aware of itself. The survival of the individual and the own race were
the only things cared for.

  Then one day they got visitors. Visitors from very far away, all
depending on how you look at it. These visitors had one thing that the
life on this planet did not have: awareness. Awareness of everything.
They knew everything and they had seen everything there was to be seen.

  Still, the life on the planet had one thing the visitors did not have:
physical bodies. With them, the visitors could do something they normally
could not do. Reproduce.

  The visitors were made of pure energy and they had decided to make
this visit permanent. They decided which of all life forms they would
merge with, and chose this very much erected mammal.

  As time went on, all the visitors on this planet had taken control
over one animal each as they reproduced. As two animals of which one or
both had been merged with a visitor and together got themselves a baby,
a new visitor had also been born and merged with it.

  Since the energy of the visitors were quite unlike the energy of the
animals, just like radio transmissions on different frequencies, the
merging of the visitors and the mammals were not complete. The visitors
could manipulate the animals, but they could not actually and totally merge
with them.

  Many thousand years passed, and the visitors got more and more
adapted to their new way of living - as did the creatures. The animals
evolved and transformed over the years into something new and different.
The visitors gave the animals more powerful influences that caused their
brains to grow totally out of proportion over the years.

  To this day, the visitors are still far from completely merged with
their hosts. They still have the ability to leave the animal they control.
The visitors have become very dependent of all the impressions the animal
can give them. They are, because of this, more or less forced to return
to the host.




  The planet? Earth.

  The visitors? Your soul.
