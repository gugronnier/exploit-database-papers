                         LEARN TO LOVE BIG BROTHER

                     Thanks to Blanc for all his help.



            "You  are right my friend!", the corrupted system told
          me  and  licked  its pale lips.  "Your text is about how
          everybody ought to think!"
            Thanks.  I have learned to love Big Brother!




  Why  fear  a  future society ruled by something that is an incarnation of
George  Orwell's  Nineteen Eighty Four Big Brother?  Big Brother is nothing
more than a machine, an advanced computer that is used by the ruling people
to  control  the  masses.   This machine will not be anything like the ones
presented  in  various  science fiction books and movies, where the machine
thinks and makes its own decisions.  The  ones that  can  be feared are the
ones who control them.  But why fear them?
  But  anyway,  somehow we feel that this society is possible to crush.  If
we start now, we will never be slaves of Big Brother.
  Listen carefully to uncle GNN and he will reveal for you the fact that it
is  not so easy to win this game anyway.  No matter who you are or what you
think, history is your enemy.

  Consider the following facts:

  1. In a future society, everything might be controlled by
     those who have access to the Big Brother system.

  2. To know how to use Big Brother, they have to know how
     to use computers.

  3. At the present time, a large amount of people actually
     know how to use a computer.

  I  guess  some  of you already know what I mean.  Who are the people that
will rule the future society?  We are!  The youths!  In the future, we will
be the ones who must make decisions and keep our power in control.  We will
be the ones who create the Big Brother because we are the frontiers when it
comes to computer technology.
  Right,  the former generation did actually create the technology from the
beginning,  but  that  does not mean that they are the ones who really know
how  it is done.  The knowledge of computers is more spread through our own
generation  and  in  the  future  there will be an intellectual war between
smart  people  who  wants to operate Big Brother. It will not be as easy to
hide Big Brother from the masses as it is now. Because the masses will have
a greater understanding about the power of computers.
  We  are  the  masses  of  the  future and some of us will be the ones who
operates Big Brother itself.
  Scary?
  Perhaps.   Since  no one can hide behind the curtain of knowledge, no one
can  really operate Big Brother without everybody else knowing about it.  I
am  not saying that it is impossible to do it, but it will never be as easy
as it is now.
  But  now  we have a problem.  At  this very moment, many people fight for
"free information", "decentralization", "liberate hackers" etc etc...  This
is  a  good  sign of common electronic non-political anarchy.  The fighters
wish  for  a future society with no Big Brother at all, no more secrets and
to  a  certain  extent; a non-corrupt society and system. It may sound good
but  will  this  movement last forever? Remember back in the 60's when many
people fought for almost the same thing but in a slightly different way.
  What happened?  What happened to their fine ideas of "world peace" and "a
new world order"?
  Well,  look around!  Nothing at all!  And where are the people who fought
for  this?  Did they just crumble like a cookie and disappear? No. They are
still here.
  So what happened?
  Let  me  tell  you what happened.  They saw the power and they wanted it.
Suddenly,  they realized that the only thing that means anything for a weak
human  mind is power and control.  They got tired of fighting for something
as  overwhelming  as world peace and went back to the silent cave where you
can  lie  to  yourself  and  believe  that you will get your damn power and
control if you just work.
  What  will  happen  in  the  future?   Those  who  claim  to  be computer
anarchists,  shockwave  riders  or  free  hackers  will  probably not last.
Suddenly,  they  will forget about their fine ideas and go for the cash and
the  ruling  position.   They  want to sit on the right side of the camera.
They want to be and operate Big Brother.
  It  is easy to be young.  One can observe the old generation and discover
all  their  mistakes.  But when the youths turn old they will be watched by
the younger generation.   And the old generation will never accept that the
young generation tells them how wrong they are.
  Look  around.   In  all governments the old generation rules.  The youths
wants  to  do  some  kind of revolution because they know what is going on.
But  when  the youths grow old, they will still believe that they know what
is  going on and desperately protect themselves from the younger generation
who  tells the older generation that they now are the ones who know what is
actually going on...
  Over and over again.  Again and again.
  So  why  fear  Big  Brother?   Why  even  fight  for his destruction when
everything  will go to hell anyway?  So come people...  think.  Do not work
for  free information, do not work for your own freedom.  Start working for
Big  Brother instead.  See him as a friend.  Love him.  Do not believe that
you  can  do anything, because you can not!  You can never beat the corrupt
society,  you  can  never  stop  the greedy kings.  So you better join them
before they crush you.
  Do not stay at the bottom and shout for revolution.
  Go for the top; go for the right side of Big Brother's global camera!
