Th'

Sitting in his room
Quiet and alone
He roams th'
electronic lands.

Standing on the edge
Wading in the pool
chrimson eyes
and darklit skies.

Running the route
With the parcel
Playing the fool
for the devil.

Running in circles
he will do
Around and around
over and over.

Flying in the sky
whispering a darklit lullaby
singing to the devils
whilst laying in the gravel.

Opening the doors
reality unfolds
the new self stands
on the ashes of the old.

The new one walks
upright with the human
devouring the waves
and deceiving at th' raves.

Fall

I have lied for her
I have cried for her
I had pride for her
I died for her

I am in
I am there
I am shun
I dissapear

I find another
I rise up
I fall down under
I fall up another

I find stuff
I look I look
stuff dissapears
stuff reappears

I think
I feel
I fall
I rise

All is as it seems
All is false
everything is true
or kill me

Honor

honor is important
truith is honor
yourself is the point
others are stuff

honor amongst thieves
stolen trust
untrust and distrust
unrest

lie to yourself
lie to me
lie to everyone
honor among thieves

be true to yourself
everything will work
be true to yourself
bork bork bork

Water proof

underwater
under the seas
dumb waiter
that's where she's

don't be a cump
don't feel the lump
don't make it worse
you need a nurse

run around the walls
run down the halls
breaking down the walls
making late night calls

i could die tomorrow
i could fly tomorrow
i could fry in sorrow
i am underwater

being pulled by the current
being dragged down
down, going under
drown

Waiting

waiting here
by my keyboard
waiting here
being bored

sitting here
waiting for a call
sitting here
ready to take a fall

mind spins
brain cringe
nothing
sitting on pins

listening to the tunes
typing stuff
getting the blues
this is tough

monochrome glare
half asleep
blank stare
the black sheep

it will all be over
when the call
it will all be worth
rise again from the fall

Bonding

bonding
wraping
pave the way
heeding the trail

cement
quick dry
holds the stance
stand fast

cracks
thoughts disturb
thoughts fold upon themselves
attacking

fear arives
fear changes thought into fear
imagined future
the future is fake

do it
be there
stand fast
have a blast

Die robot die

the robot stands there
scanning the horison
searching for more emotion
the murderer of emotions

the human searches
searches the land
searches for emotion
emoton to fill the void

the robot came across a villiage
a villiage of great
a villiage of fate
it was the bait

the human spots his fate
a long lost date
the time is here
the robot draws near

they clash their steel
steel bends and folds
the tales are untold
the human grows old
