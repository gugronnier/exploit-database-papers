                              Taking a Bus Ride
                                 by Knyttet

I'm sitting in a bus, looking out through the window.
I don't see anything out there, cause I'm not concentrating, I'm just staring
out to have something to lay my eyes on.
I'm listening to the people around me.

In front of me there are two middle-aged women, chatting.
I can't concentrate on what they are saying.  It's so uninteresting.
I'm thinking to myself "I hope I'll never be like that."
Of course I sometimes gossip with my friends (I'm a woman) but not like this!
It's like their putting their foot in it with every word they are saying.
I know that, usually, this kind of talk is nothing to take seriously, it's
just "bullshit", but why are they talking so much shit about other people,
not here to defend themselves?
What's the purpose?
What is it giving them?

Behind me, a teenage boy and girl, kissing loudly.
I start to dream back to when I was fifteen, kissing in a bus.
Life was then.
No responsibility, no duties.
Easy.
But I say to myself "I don't want to be there again."
Cause even though things were easy, you knew that life wasn't real, because
no one in the "grownup world" took you seriously.

To my right, a boy listening to music from a portable CD-player.
It looks like he is enjoying himself cause he is banging his head, and I
guess it's because of the music.

In front of him, there is an elderly couple.
They have probably taken the bus just because they have become too old to
drive. I'm glad there are some that have the sense to realize when they are
too old to be out on the roads.
The woman is nagging on the man.
Why is it always like this?
Once again I say to myself "don't be like that when you grow old."
My grandparents are just like that. I can't understand why. Because they know
that they love each other, so why can't they just be nice to each other the
last couple of years.

Normally, I don't take the bus, but today I couldn't afford the petrol to my
car, so I had to. Sitting here listening to all these people around me that I
don't really want to hear but I can't shut their voices out.

I begin to feel sorry for all people out there who are forced to go by bus
every day. I guess you get used to it and I start to think about that day,
the day that might come when we all will be forced to use public
transportation because of environmental pollution.
Until that day I will go in my car, it isn't worth the money to take the bus.
