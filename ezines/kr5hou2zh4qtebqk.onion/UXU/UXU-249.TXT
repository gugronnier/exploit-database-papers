*   The intro.      "luXury? We knew that!"

*   Well, we're here again, in case someone didn't notice. As mentioned
*   before (and better to be mentioned again), we don't have any dead-
*   lines, release schedules or plans for the future or past, and that
*   is something that will not change, as someone probably also noticed.
*   The almost four month gap between the last and this release has
*   brought both wanted and unwanted attention to this series. We've
*   been called 'defunct', we've been asked if we're still alive, and
*   we've been mentioned in several non-electronic magazines as well
*   as electronic ones. We have our own WWW homepage (check at the end
*   of this index) and a new ftp distribution site, as well as a couple
*   of new Bulletin Board System distribution sites. A big thanks and
*   welcome to the crew to all of them!

*   The last release included a competition where You could be one of
*   ten lucky winners of cool designer uXu t-shirts. Compared to the
*   response to the suggestion we made a couple of years ago about a
*   "text file awards", this was a smash hit! Two days after the release
*   had been distributed, we had ten winners. With regard to anonymousness
*   on the net, we won't print their names. Those of you who won, know
*   who you are, and if you want to come out of the closet and tell the
*   world. :) Anyway, the winners were from:

*                5 from the U.S. (and the quickest ones to reply)
*                3 from Sweden
*                1 from Holland
*                1 from Germany

                                                       The Chief / uXu


*   uXu, through Anonymous ftp?  uXu Mailing List?  Fsp?  WWW?

*   True! All files (0-249) are available from the sites listed at the end
    of this file. These sites will get the new releases after the people
    on the Mailing-List have received their packages.

    If you have an Internet address, you can subscribe to uXu (and request
    back-issues) by E-Mailing uxu-info-request@lysator.liu.se. When you
    request back-issues, please list the number(s) of the issue(s) instead
    of title(s). Example:

    Subject: uXu BACK-ISSUES

    Body: 220,019,235,091,233

    To subscribe, just let the body of the letter contain the word
    "SUBSCRIBE", and every new release will be mailed to you as soon
    as it is ready. Simple and easy.


    uXu Copyright Notice?

    We're sorry to have to add this notice to our files, but it was
    necessary. Please read through the small but informative notice
    at the end of this textfile and believe us when we tell you that
    it had to be done. There's absolutely no respect these days.


    Easy way to find what's new.

    At the far left-side of the index files, there are asterisks "*",
    which let you know what's new since last time. You don't have to
    read through the whole index for the latest info, just scan the
    file for the asterisks.

   Member -->  We're happy if you write a minimum of two files/release.
               You do have to write something for each release to be
               listed as Member.

   Contributor -->  We don't expect you to write for each release. You
                    write when you have something to write about. We do
                    want you to write something for every 3 releases
                    to be listed as Contributor.

   Distribution Site -->  To become a distribution site, we have to check
                          your BBS first, so include name/number/speed/
                          sysop handle and nup (if there is one) when
                          applying.

                          As a support board, you'll have one file-area
                          for and with all currently available uXu files
                          and one where submissions/contributions to uXu
                          may be uploaded by your users. Password protected
                          files in normal upload areas are okay too.

                          The first BBS that applies (and gets an 'OK') in
                          each country becomes that country's uXu "head-
                          quarters", with whatever sneaky advantages that
                          may bring.

                          It's a + if you have access to the internet.

November  March  November  March  November  March Releases 1995:

236: "Enforced" by The GNN.   Chemistry made it possible from the start.
Alcohol. What can we say about it? That it is nice to have a few beers
among friends a friday night? That it creates problems for others? That
it is classified as a drug. That it kills? In more ways that you'd
imagine.

237: "HoHoCon '94 Review" by Dr. No.   Futuristic fiction? Another
planet? Space aliens roaming about? No no. This is a report from
HoHoCon 1994. Read all about it! Who was there? Who wasn't there
What happened behind the scenes? Who got the Traci Lords video tapes?
Just read it and dream you were there.

238: "The Internet Hysteria" by The GNN.   Our society is changing. The
internet has been brought down to "ground-level" and with it, a vast
number of magazines, articles, TV shows and whatnot. New users on the
internet today have a massive guide in these, a guide that tells the
truth? A guide that they will follow? A guide that might destroy the
whole internet?

239: "Master Mind" by Classified Knowledge.   Here, for our mind
expanding series, we find yet another file. This time from an anonymous
contributor on the topic of controlling someone else's mind from a
distance. He, or she, describes the simple technique which you can
try out yourself after reading these instructions.

240: "Survive IRC" by The GNN.   Hell, a survive guide for IRC from uXu?
Well, why not? One of these days, even _you_ could end up on IRC, if
you haven't already (then you know of these things). For new users of
this chat-land, what could be better than a guide like this?

241: "Ellen Keys" by The Chief.   Does it take much to get arrested
these days? Who knows how it's like in _your_ country today, but we're
all heading for a society where information is the criminal, the author
the responsible, and the victim the reader, if we don't do something
about it pretty soon.

242: "No More Secrets" by The GNN.   A file that could be linked to the
others in our view of the government versus hackers. We have several
files on this topic, but the more the better we feel, so here's another
one that takes another step to try to get the true information out in
the open.

243: "Meaning of?" by Polish Polish.   Just imagine yourself at the
very very top of the cream. You could do whatever you wanted, (and still
be arrested somehow of course, but that's not the point!) What would you
do? What would you say?

244: "The New World Order" by The GNN.   To create a new world order
would take a whole lot of work and money, don't you think? To have
the masses behind you, with the same judgement and values as you,
with guns or not. A pretty hard task for most of us. Or is it?

245: "Party Time" by Pivic.   Some unfinished business can be your
worst nightmare when you least expect it. What happens during an
evening can change your whole life. Be aware of it before it happens.

246: "A Slight Miscalculation" by The GNN.   How would time traveling
look like, do you think? Would it be an easy task creating time machines
that would work? Work like they were made to work? How about testing?
Who would do the testing and what would that create? Now, that's
humour for you.

247: "The 'Land" by Hollywood.   Personal view from a new contributor
on things that might well be a future problem. Who knows what new
technology and little used brains might create? Read this and get
hooked into a line of thought.

248: "What Is This Thing Called Progress?" by The GNN.   Who wants
to know? You? Me? All of us? Well then. The GNN presents some thoughts
on the subject. Maybe it will create a thought in your head?

249: "uXu Index #20" by The Chief.   Thank you! Yes, it's here. After
Christmas. But what did you expect? I know. Nothing. But, here it comes.
The index file for this release. What you don't know about it already,
I don't know, but for old time's sake, here are some of the contents:
Updates, a small introduction, new information, long and short descriptions
plus statistics. Okay then. That should be enough for you to grab this
unmissable file. Here are some more good words to make you want it:

          - An introduction about current events by The Chief.
          - Updated Writer and Support Board Lists.
          - An updated uXu Hall of Thanks and Honorary Member List.
          - An updated list of all uXu files in Short format.
          - In-depth descriptions of the new files.
          - An updated list of places where to contact and find uXu.

      [#249 also includes an Index for the uXu-S and DSR series]
