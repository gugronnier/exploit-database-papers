  First time I saw him, he was standing by my desk. Apparently he had placed
  all my computer stuff on the floor, leaving the desk completely empty.
  He had a light brown costume and the same old haircut.
    A quick look at my scanner told me that someone had been using it as
  background protection when spray painting things black. I could still see
  the contours of the objects painted; a pencil box, a calculator and two
  small loudspeakers.
    I thought perhaps the scanner was still intact. When I lifted up the
  cover, the lens was all black striped. I told him he would have to pay for
  this. No response.
    On the wall there was a sign, saying with big letters that if you win you
  could stay at a luxury hotel, or at a cheaper one with the possibility to
  leave it within three hours, at any time.
    He went into the kitchen. When I entered it myself, he was dressed in
  all black, SWAT-style including a black cap. He was wearing dark glasses and
  currently smearing his chin and his cheeks with charcoal, to make it look
  like he hadn't shaved for a couple of days.

    We were off to the city.
