*   The intro.      "Government typically acts slowly, ineffectively,
*                    wastefully, like a lumbering hippopotamus. Without
*                    this impediment people would be free to make their
*                    own provisions for their protection as they saw
*                    fit. There would be no Big Brother, no stifling
*                    bureaucracy, no unresponsive government agencies."
*
*                                                 - John Hospers (%)
*
*   Well, five, almost six months ago, the last batch of files were
*   released. Both you and I know there's nothing funny about that.
*   We're all a part of this thing called life, and it constantly
*   surprises us by changing from one day to the other. Summer's been
*   here and gone. Autumn is all around us, and most of us are back at
*   school or work, and funny enough, that's when we found time to
*   write the files included in this release. You'll find over twenty
*   files, which I guess is a 'first' for a release from uXu. Though
*   it should not be regarded as a compensation for the lack of files
*   released lately. It just seems like autumn makes the mind work
*   somehow. Hope you all will enjoy the files.
*
*   A note to the distribution sites that applied between the last
*   release and this one; please re-apply if you're still out there.
*   Because of the long time between releases, we decided not to add
*   any distribution sites at all this time to make sure we wouldn't
*   create any confusion. Thanks for your understanding.
*
*   On a side-note: two files in this release cover the latest (and
*   in our eyes) dumbest discussion about uXu - that we're a cover
*   for the hacking group S.H.A. Let me tell you right now - we're
*   not. If you don't take my word for it, please read the files.
*
*   Here's a small note from MARIO@mksinfo.qc.ca by the way:
*
*   "Residents of Montreal interested in starting 2600 meetings once a
*    month e-mail me immediately."
*
*   % - quote taken from "An Introduction To Philosophical Analysis",
*       Routledge, third edition, 1992.
*
*                             It won't be five months 'til the next one.
                                                      / The Chief

    uXu, through Anonymous ftp?  uXu Mailing List?  Fsp?  WWW?

*   True! All files (0-268) are available from the sites listed at the end
    of this file. These sites will get the new releases after the people
    on the Mailing-List have received their packages.

    If you have an Internet address, you can subscribe to uXu (and request
    back-issues) by E-Mailing uxu-info-request@lysator.liu.se. When you
    request back-issues, please list the number(s) of the issue(s) instead
    of title(s). Example:

    Subject: uXu BACK-ISSUES

    Body: 258,019,235,263,233

    To subscribe, just let the body of the letter contain the word
    "SUBSCRIBE", and every new release will be mailed to you as soon
    as it is ready. Simple and easy.


    uXu Copyright Notice?

    We're sorry to have to add this notice to our files, but it was
    necessary. Please read through the small but informative notice
    at the end of this textfile and believe us when we tell you that
    it had to be done. There's absolutely no respect these days.


    Easy way to find what's new.

    At the far left-side of the index files, there are asterisks "*",
    which let you know what's new since last time. You don't have to
    read through the whole index for the latest info, just scan the
    file for the asterisks.

   Member -->  We're happy if you write a minimum of two files/release.
               You do have to write something for each release to be
               listed as Member.

   Contributor -->  We don't expect you to write for each release. You
                    write when you have something to write about. We do
                    want you to write something for every 3 releases
                    to be listed as Contributor.

   Distribution Site -->  To become a distribution site, we have to check
                          your BBS first, so include name/number/speed/
                          sysop handle and nup (if there is one) when
                          applying.

                          As a support board, you'll have one file-area
                          for and with all currently available uXu files
                          and one where submissions/contributions to uXu
                          may be uploaded by your users. Password protected
                          files in normal upload areas are okay too.

                          The first BBS that applies (and gets an 'OK') in
                          each country becomes that country's uXu "head-
                          quarters", with whatever sneaky advantages that
                          may bring.

                          It's a + if you have access to the Internet.

March  September  March  September  March  September Releases 1995:

250: "Swift Justice" by The GNN.   Chemistry has nothing to
do with it I'm afraid. What does have to do with this story
then?, you ask. Power. Work. Guilt. Execution. Intelligence.
That should be enough to make you interested.

251: "Your Own Life" by Phearless.   Futuristic? No. A true
story? Well, not really a story. It could have been though,
but unfortunately it isn't. Best described, thoughts about
the truths of the system.

252: "Letter To a Prisoner" by The GNN.   Our own power-
penetrating philosopher looks through the blinds of society
and questions the authorities' way of handling the criminal
system of today.

253: "Guide To a College-Year Abroad" by McCoy.   Here are
some answers to questions foreigners might have about
going to college in the U.S. Just take it seriously if
you want. Or just don't.

254: "Is This Art?" by The GNN.   Hell does exist on earth!
What? It does? Where is it? Where can I find it? Here's
one who found it, or should I say, thought she found it.
And she's not alone.

255: "More Time!" by Phearless.   A futuristic story with a
twist to it, that'll hopefully make you think a bit about
what the future might look like. Read it and act before it
is too late!

256: "Angel" by The GNN.   Are there angels, one might ask?
I can't answer that questions, as I am not sure myself, but
I think you might find somewhat of an answer in this, nice
yet intriguing story.

257: "Suicidal" by The Chief.   Just imagine everyone telling
you to do it. To go through with it, or you're a damn coward.
Laughing in your face. Pushing you in the corridors. Until
you can't take it anymore. Would you do it?

258: "uXu And S.H.A., Facts And Fiction" by The GNN.   We
were forced to write this one. To make certain that no-one
had any doubts about what uXu really is all about, and that
we're _not_, I repeat, _not_, a hacker group.

259: "Love, Sex And Marriage" by Leon Felkins.   As the title
suggests, this file is about love, sex and marriage. More
accurately, it is about why we react the way we do with regard
to love, sex and marriage. This one will create discussions.

260: "On 'Love, Sex And Marriage'" by The GNN.   A direct
and genuine discussion about the previous file (259) from the
GNN, able to penetrate the subject, from a philosopher's
point of view.

261: "A Guide To Paranoia" by Phearless.   Personally, I feel
that this is the third part of Phearless series about chaos,
panic and paranoia, and who's going to tell me it is not?
If you're not paranoid yet, you better check this one out.

262: "To Kill a Bouncer" by The GNN.   Who hasn't met these
at the doors to a club, at a bar or at the front of a concert?
And who can say that most of them are nice and friendly? Even
without these questions, I know you will like this one.

263: "The Evil Demon" by The Chief.   And god created man?
Well, who can be sure of that these days when science is our
newly born 'god' that we can depend upon. But can we be sure
of _that_ 'god' then? Are you sure?

264: "David Letterman" by Phearless.   Yes, the story has got the
same name as the late show host, but does that mean that it
contains guests, music and a top ten list? Read it and find
out for yourself.

265: "DMV & 2D Bar Codes" by Mario.   What could be more
suitable than a technical file in this release? Without one
we wouldn't be complete. Here it is. About (what we sort of
already have in Sweden) the future U.S. ID cards.

266: "Year of Fun" by Phearless.   Look at this story, covering a
whole year. Doesn't it seem familiar? Perhaps too familiar?
Isn't this a description of what _your_ life looked like last
year? I bet it is!

267: "Respublica" by The GNN.   Now this one is really up-to-date
these days with all the elections going on, at least here in
Europe. Makes you think about why _your_ vote should be _your_
vote, and nothing else.

268: "uXu Index #21" by The Chief.   That's it! Writing about these
indexes are becoming pretty tiresome, because I know as well as you
know you're (to a 99% accurate assumption) reading the index when you
read this! Yes, well, what are you waiting for? Info about the index
when you just (almost) read it? Yes? Okay, here it is: The index
includes not just updates, an introduction, new (and old) information,
long and short descriptions + statistics, but more specifically:

          - An introduction about current events by The Chief.
          - Updated Writer and Support Board Lists.
          - An updated uXu Hall of Thanks and Honorary Member List.
          - An updated list of all uXu files in Short format.
          - In-depth descriptions of the new files.
          - An updated list of places where to contact and find uXu.

      [#268 also includes an Index for the uXu-S and DSR series]
