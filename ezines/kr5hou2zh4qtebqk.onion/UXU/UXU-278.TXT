                           GUARDIANS OF THE MASSES
                       by THE GNN/DualCrew-Shining/uXu



On the streets, in public places, perhaps even in your own house, you will
notice a peculiar phenomenon: the lack of space. Wherever you look they are
always there, carrying their small minds, small problems and small
personalities as if it was a trophy. They have conquered the world and now
they try to conquer the minds of their guardians. They want to shape their
guardians into statues of themselves, they aim at the global conformity.
Everyone ought to be like them, they say, because they are the rulers of
the world. Their interests, their problems and their personalities must
overtake the world. They are the masses, the 'common people'. Their
guardians are the few people who own the precious ability to think. This is
the hard and brutal truth of today, exposed and presented without mercy.
   The mass-man of today is ignorant, but he does not understand that. On
the contrary; the mass-man thinks of himself as a very aware and open-minded
individual. He truly believes that his problems must be solved, since the
future well-being of the world rests upon them. As a child cries and thinks
the world has fallen apart when a toy is broken, the mass-man sees his agony
as justified. The mass-man thinks he is unique, because the masses keep
telling each other so. In fact, he is not unique: he is a mass-man, a part
of the masses, a part of the cancer that has swallowed society.
   Do not flatter yourself with the belief that you have come to the
conclusion that the masses are the workers, the uneducated or the poor. If
you believe so, you are terribly wrong. Education, wealth or social status
is no criteria on who is a mass-man or who is not. The mass-men does not
even have to share the same ideas or ideologies. On the surface, they might
look like completely different persons, but when you find the fundamental
grounds you will see that they are all the same. They just dress themselves
and their thoughts differently.
   The real individuals, the real owners of the real problems, the real
owners of real knowledge are the guardians. The guardians may look like
mass-men, but in their minds you will not, as in the mass-man, find
simplicity but complexity. Do not mix this form of 'complexity' with the
concept of 'confusion.' The guardian is a very aware person. He sees right
through the simple questions and the simple answers. He knows that the world
is complex, but he strives to understand this complexity. He does not, as
the mass-man does, worship simple dogmas in any form. He loves knowledge and
he constantly tries to reach the utopia of full understanding. The guardian
need not to be a scientist, because scientists are often the worst mass-men
of all. The guardian trusts his sight and his mind. The mass-man can never
understand how the guardians think. But the guardians know very well the
anatomy of the masses, and the mass-man.
   The guardians are not popular among the masses. In fact, the worst enemy
to be found for a mass-man is a guardian. Looking at the guardian, the
mass-man will not see himself. He will see a stranger. The mass-man gains no
support for his simple views of the world from the guardian. Instead, he
will be silenced. The guardian will explain why the mass-man is wrong, and
not only that - he will also reveal that the mass-man is a part of the
masses. This is too much for the mass-man. He will refuse to listen. He will
accuse the guardian of blasphemy, he will claim that the guardian plays
with words, he will use violence to keep the guardian away from him and the
masses. The guardian, however, will not be shocked. He knows the mass-man,
and he knows why they react the way they do. Still, he will keep on guarding
them. The guardians guard the masses.
   Knowledge is sought by the guardians. They want to build a better world,
not because they love the masses, but because they care. They pity the
mass-man, but they will not turn their backs on them. The guardians are
no cynics. Those who throw cynical thoughts around them are mass-men who
believe that they are intellectual, that they have 'seen through it all.'
The mass-man has no moral. He just wants to satisfy his primitive drives,
nothing else. He need not to learn anything, because he knows everything
there is to know in his little world. Violence is his only way of
communication. Totalitarianism and laws, upholded by other mass-men, makes
him feel secure. Their enemies are freedom, knowledge and everything else
that might throw them out of their 'safe' world. Hence, the worst enemy
of them all is the guardian, because he refuses to enter their sphere. The
guardian has stepped out of the mass-men's sphere, to find the truth and
to protect the masses meanwhile.
   The masses must be protected. If they were not, the world would soon fall
apart. The guardians keep the mass-man alive. They do it because they are
benevolent and caring people. They will never be appreciated, because the
masses are not aware of the guardians' function. This does not matter: the
guardians are proud people, fully aware of their noble mission, they need no
extra encouragement. The very knowledge that the guardians are trying to
wipe out stupidity in favor for a clear and open mind, is enough for them.
   Last, if it by some reason should not be perfectly obvious from whom
the masses need to be protected, I will reveal the simple, but yet true,
answer: from themselves.



---
Of course, no one will admit that he is a mass-man.
This is, by definition of 'mass-man', impossible.
Instead, all people will place themselves in the
sphere of the guardians. I suppose you, who read
this file, have already done that. But if you did
not know that you were a part of the guardians
before you read this file, then I must unfortunately
inform you that you are not, and never will be.
