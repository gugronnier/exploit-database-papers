-=( How to avoid getting hangover )=----------------------------------------

This text is written from both selfexperienced and recommended methods from
various types of people. It's not guaranteed that it will work for you, but
it has work for me and for those people I've heard it from.


-=( While at it )=----------=(1)=-

- The best thing is ofcourse not to drink any alcohol at all. =^)
  But if you do there is some things to think of while doing it to
  increase the day-after effect.

        - Do NOT mix (drink) beer, wine and liquire at the same evening.
           Just hold on to one kind. If you mix, you'll definitly get a
           hangover the next day! Or at least you'll throw up all over the
           toilet. Wine and liquire can be 'acceptable', but not beer and
           wine or liquire! That's for sure!

        - Avoid liquier with alcohol halt over 40%!
           (Everything over 50% should definitly be classified as drugs.
            ONE drink during dinner is okay, but that's all!)


-=( Before sleeping )=-------=(2)=-

- It's recommended to prepare your sleeping location BEFORE starting
  drinking so you just can 'drop dead' when comming back.

        -  Open a window. Fresh air is the best anti-hangover medicine ever.
           Remember to keep your body warm though, alcohol reduces the
           capacity of keep warm by itself.

        - Make yourself a bottle of lemonwater. Drink it when you wake
           up. It refills all the loss you've made the evening before.

        - Another thing to do is to eat some toasted bread with salt on it
           (before sleeping ofcourse). I know, it doesn't sound very appetizing,
           but it does miracle to your upcomminghangover. Drink nothing but
           water to this.

FACT: Hangover is actually nothing but lack of water and salt in your body.
      When drinking a lot of alcohol your body gets rinsed out. If you
      haven't noticed it yet but you are running to the toilet a lot when
      drinking.


-=( Food'n'booze )=----------=(3)=-

- There is several alcoholabsorbent food to eat to feel better.

        - Eat at lest 1 (one) hour before drinking. This makes your stomach
           more capable to handle you later consuming. Alcohol is NOT good
           for you stomach walls. It corrodes into the flesh and can cause
           serious wounds. If you eat before you'll have something else
           hitting the alcohol instead of just the stomach wall.

        - All food that contains fat does bind up alcohol. The best thing
           to eat (if you don't want to feel drunk) is chocolatemouse! Ouch!
           It formaly grabs the alcohol and won't let it away. But this does
           NOT makes you more alcohol resistant, you'll feel the effect
           after a little while longer instead.

        - Other food types is:
                Milk
                Cream
                and for all swedish guys: FilmjM-wlk

-=( Hangover )=--------------=(4)=-

- If you wake up and find out that you have a hangover it's not much to do
  about it. Well, take some aspirin (I've heard that some persons get a
  headache...strange! =^), drink water, try to eat and if needed - PUKE!
  Do some of the above mentioned things...

-=( Epilogue )=--------------=(5)=-

- I wouldn't recommend anybody to drink, but it's up to him/her if they
  want to do it. Just take it easy and beware of all stupid thing you
  can/will do when drunk!

- I have (now) choosed to live a life without boozing (at least for a long
  time). I'm NOT an alcoholic, but I realised it's not worth boozing around
  and wake up the day after totaly nuked!
