*   The intro.      "Surely, as we all know, knowledge is something
*                    intrinsically ... good"
*                                               - The GNN
*
*   First, let me say how happy we all are about the enormous response
*   we received for our contest in the last release! We have never received
*   so many answers, and most of them correct answers, to a competition,
*   which means that we'll definitely hold more competitions in the future!
*
*   And the winners are:
*   --------------------
*   Tremolo, from Germany - 1st Prize: Black Philes II CD-ROM
*   Biff Sandal, from the US - 2nd Prize: X-Philes (underground) CD-ROM
*   Topeka, also from the US - 3rd Prize: X-Philes (non-underground) CD-ROM
*
*   You have all received your prizes when you read this! Congratulations!
*
*   Second, this is my last release as Editor of the uXu series. I have
*   been the Editor for five years now, and I feel it is time for me to
*   enjoy the good life as an ordinary Member now. 23 Indexes and 23
*   releases as Editor during these five years is a pretty good record
*   I think, and now I'll concentrate on writing good files for the future
*   releases instead. The new Editor is Bravemoore. You reach him through
*   any of our "request" addresses (see below). I know he will do a good
*   job, as he has shown that earlier with another publication.
*
*   Well, this is The Chief, signing off as Editor, but still Member!
*   Oh, I forgot to mention that this is the biggest release in uXu history
*   so far by the way. 28 new files, making up for all the months that have
*   passed since the last release. It is a lot to read, and who knows? Maybe
*   this is our Christmas present to you? Just in case, let's say that it
*   is an early one!
                                                        / The Chief



    uXu, through Anonymous FTP?  uXu Mailing List?  FSP?  WWW?

*   You got it! All files (0-363) are available from the sites listed at the
    end of this file. These sites will get the new releases after the people
    on the Mailing-List have received their packages.

    If you have an Internet address, you can subscribe to uXu (and request
    back-issues) by emailing uxu-request@lysator.liu.se. When you request
    back-issues, please list the number(s) of the issue(s) instead of
    title(s). Example:

    Subject: uXu BACK-ISSUES

    Body: 21, 101, 220, 361

    To subscribe, just let the body of the letter contain the word
    "SUBSCRIBE", and every new release will be mailed to you as soon
    as it is ready. Simple and easy.

    If you do not want all the files mailed to you, but just a single
    message that tells you when a release is out: Send email to
    uxu-info-request@lysator.liu.se with the subject "subscribe".


   ---------------------------------------------------------------------
        Be a part of the uXu team!  Here's what you need to know...
   ---------------------------------------------------------------------

   If you're on any kind of net connected in any way to the Internet
*  just email Bravemoore. (uxu-request@lysator.liu.se) asking for information
   on how to join (subject: "uXu Join"). If you're interested in making
   your BBS, site or whatever a distribution site: (subject: "uXu Dist").
   You will have the information you requested in your mailbox ASAP.

   If you're not on any kind of net connected in any way to the Internet
   it's a bit tricky. Then you have to call one of the boards listed at
   the end of this file and leave private mail to uXu. The tricky bit
   includes a bit of waiting on your side for a reply.

June  November  June  November  June  November Releases 1996:

337: "6 Four A - Six Short Poems" by The GNN.   These poems were
written under extreme pressure and with a lot of sensitivity. Dark
and frightening but still true in a sense. Try them. Maybe you will
like them?

338: "Taking a Bus Ride" by Knyttet.   You know how it is like when
you are going by bus. You usually have enough time to think about
this and that, what to eat tonight and the world crisis at hand, at
the same time. Here are some thoughts from a bus ride.

339: "Screenplay: The Last Bullet" by The GNN.   This is a screenplay
adapted from the short story "Angel" (uXu file #256). If you want to
take a look at the screen shots to it as well, please check any of our
homepages listed at the end of this file. You can also see a quick
collection of some screen shots in uXu file #360.

340: "Swedish Moose Surprise" by Knyttet.   Are we really alone in
this country thinking that it is pretty worthwhile to know as much
as possible about another country when you go to that country? No,
probably not. But here is a couple who never thought about it.

341: "The Infinite Wisdom Chip" by The GNN.   What would happen if
we did have access to all the information, every piece of the big
information cake? Isn't that exactly what we are all looking for,
and heading towards these days?

342: "Mind Expectations" by Knyttet.   You go around mumbling to
yourself all day? You yell at your next-door neighbor? You hate
that guy or girl (you know who I'm talking about)? Well, why not?
But what's the point? Why not try to make an effort, to be nice
for a change?

343: "Medieval Dreams" by Mercuri.   Critics reading this series
will love this one, because they will have a field day with it.
The discussion about what's good and what's not, when it comes to
war and peace continues. Here with thoughts from Mercuri.

344: "Screenplay: In The Colosseum" by The GNN.   This is a screenplay
adapted from the short story "Interrogation" (uXu file #166). If you want
to take a look at the screen shots to it as well, please check any of
our homepages listed at the end of this file. You can also see a
quick collection of some screen shots in uXu file #360.

345: "Magic" by Knyttet.   So, you say that we are all gloomy, dark
and depressing, huh? Well, then you should take a closer look at this
piece, and see if you're not smiling after you have read it. We all
need a little cheering up now and then. This is now.

346: "Mailing Lists - Part 1" by The Chief.   There are several thousand
mailing lists on the Internet. Each day, a new one is born. Each day
a mailing list dies. If you're seriously planning on starting your own
mailing list, you need to take a look at this basic introduction, which
will give you an idea to what you're getting yourself involved with.

347: "Head Full of Chewing Gum" by Knyttet.   When you want to say that
really really important thing to that extremely good looking girl/guy,
and all that comes out of your mouth is "duh..", then you know what
we're talking about.

348: "Poesis/The Slab1.0" by aleph-6.   For those of you with a more
advanced bizarre taste in poetry and stories, this is a two-part
extravaganza thingy. Pretty generous don't you think? Nothing for
those of you with a fragile mind.

349: "More Than One Truth" by Knyttet.   How many truths do you think
are out there? Do you believe there's only one single and simple truth?
Do you believe everything they say on the news? Yes? No? In any case,
you should read this file. It might give you some ideas.

350: "The Decline of The Swedish Underground" by Dare Devil Show.   If
you did understand Swedish, and read a couple of issues of the electronic
publication mentioned in this file, you'll understand what Dare Devil
Show is talking about. But, if you're interested in learning more about
the Swedish underground anyway, this file is for you.

351: "To Make Choices In Life" by Knyttet.   Like everyone else in this
world, you have to make choices. Now, tomorrow, yesterday. You make
choices at all times. Some more important, some not that important, but
still choices. Here are some thoughts about this.

352: "Screenplay: Burn Time" by The GNN.   This is a screenplay adapted
from the short story "Gas Station" (uXu file #190). If you want to take
a look at the screen shots to it as well, please check any of our homepages
listed at the end of this file. You can also see a quick collection
of some screen shots in uXu file #360.

353: "Why I Prefer To Be a Woman" by Knyttet.   Open your eyes and
read through this one guys. Here are the facts. Why it is better
to be a woman than a man. You can clearly see that everything written
in this file must be true, right?

354: "The Internet Word Reference Book - Chapter I" by The Chief.
Think about it! Do you know where the words and terms used on the
Internet today comes from? From the very beginning? Some people have
tried to explain this, but failed. Finally, there is a correct
reference! And here is the first chapter.

355: "The Creator" by Knyttet.   Questions about why we are here,
who put us here, and what we are supposed to do with all our spare
time, are pretty common. Knyttet does not try to give you answers
to these questions, but does have a pretty nifty theory.

356: "Bukowski's Birthday" by Joseph.   Will Bukowski get another
tie on his birthday? No, probably not. Something one might wonder
about, if one were interested in such things. Well, if you are
wondering if Bukowski gets another tie, go ahead and read this one.

357: "Move" by Knyttet.   Do you know a love story when you see one?
Well, you're going to see this one miles away. Even though the title
doesn't really reveal that much, you ought to know that this is one,
with roses and every emotion involved. When you're moving.

358: "The Point" by The GNN.   One thing that has been clear to us
over the years, is that people want to know the point. The point
of this and the point of that. Whatever we have done, there has
always been someone asking what the point was. So, here you go,
here is the answer.

359: "A Teacher's View" by Knyttet.   When you teach children, you
definitely know that you can make a change in their lives. The things
you teach them today, may eventually decide what they will become
in the future.

360: "Screenplay Screen Shots" by uXu.   In this file you'll find an
uuencoded JPG picture with selected screen shots for the three screenplays
included in this release. All complete screen shots can be found on
any of our homepages (see below for addresses).

361: "Her Volvo" by Knyttet.   Ahh.. to love a car. Isn't that one
of the most beautiful things one can do these days? No? Oh well,
you're probably right. Anyway, here's a short story about a girl
and her car. A Volvo.

362: "Three Poems" by Scott Poole.   About three.., actually exactly
three beautiful poems by Scott. You will laugh, you will cry. Just
read them, okay?

363: "uXu Index #25" by The Chief.   The last and 23rd Index from
me, and the start of a new era of Indexes from the new Ed Bravemoore.
Well, you know what to expect from the Indexes by now, complete info
about where, who, why, what and when. Sort of like a FAQ. That's it,
the uXu FAQ. Go get it if you're not reading it now!

            [#363 also includes an index for the uXu-S series]
