                                 Another day
                                  by Joseph


Recently I had a discussion with one of my friends about what kind of
government or constitution we ought to have. Or, to be honest, he talked
a lot and tried to convince me that a communist state was to be preferred.
During that discussion, a few questions came to my mind. Questions that 
must be answered prior to any kind of 'political' discussion.
   The first question I asked myself was: is there really something wrong
with the kind of society we have today? The answer seemed obvious at first.
But the more I thought about, the less secure I felt. Maybe the kind of
society we have now is more or less perfect; only problem being that the
people in it has not matured enough to understand and agree with its basic
principles. I quickly dropped that idea. Because a good society should pay
attention to the people, and since the one we have today obviously does
not - it is not a good form of society.
   The second question I asked myself was: if it really is the people
that is the 'problem', should they be governed by themselves or by someone
who knows better, someone who can lead them to a better and more (excuse the
term) enlightened way of thinking? A kind of thinking that is beneficial to
the people themselves. Or, and this is perhaps one of the most important
questions I asked myself during that evening: can we trust each other? Can I 
trust you to make the right decisions for me? This is a fundamental problem. 
Can we at all really trust each other, or do we need a 'state' to protect 
us - from ourselves? I found no answer to that question. All day long I meet 
people whom I would never trust with my money, child or liquor. But on the 
other hand, can I trust the state? I do not know.
   The third question I asked myself was: is a society which is run by the 
people living in it the best (so-called direct democracy)? This is where I 
could no longer discuss with myself. Since I do not know whether I can trust 
either the state or the people in it - I have no clue.
   After a while I kinda came to my senses (I started to sober up a bit).
I tried to clear things up in my head. Are there not some things that we all
can agree on and be sure of? But what would that be? Perhaps that we are all
alike. We should treat each other in a nice way, with no regard to color of
the skin or wealth. No, that does not work either. Somehow, almost everyone
tries to label people in some way; black, white, poor, rich, sexy, drunk.
And since we all do it - more or less - we end up treating each other 
differently. But what if that is one of the things we should start working 
on. If, or when, we can treat each other good (nearly said 'like people'), 
then we have something in common: respect for each other, and perhaps more 
understanding. Because, if you think hard, what is it that unites us now?
   Humtedum, tudeliduuu... See! It is not much! Of course, there is no way
in hell a society could work out if we do not trust each other, or if we do 
not have anything in common.
   When I had cured my soberness I thought: Or is it just me? Am I the only
one with such a 'pessimistic' (in lack of a better word) view of the human
race? Perhaps all you people out there really trust each other. Maybe you
even fancy each other. My head fell down to my chest and I thought really
hard (and snored a little too). A couple of minutes later I looked up to my
somewhat bothered friend and thought: No! It cannot be! If you (or should I 
rather say 'we') all really liked each other, you would share your wealth
with people less fortunate. Then there would actually be solidarity around. 
Or maybe, is it the mere presence of a state that prevents you from doing 
something for your neighbour? Have your own awareness been replaced by
the thought that the state should take care of everything?
   Again my head fell down, this time I felt quite puzzled. How can we know
if people would take responsibility for each other when the only way to find
out is to take it back from the state and give it to the people. A giant 
risk, indeed.
   My friend poked me in the belly and informed me that we ought to leave
the establishment before they threw us out. Or more specifically - me.
   I could not agree more.
