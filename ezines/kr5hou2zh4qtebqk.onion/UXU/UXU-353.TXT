                        Why I Prefer To Be a Woman
                                by Knyttet

The number one reason: Women are smarter than men.
   Sometimes we pretend to be dumb, but that's part of the plan. One of the
easiest ways to keep a man happy is to make him believe he is smarter than
you. So, all you men out there, watch out when you meet someone acting like a
bimbo. Especially if she is blonde. This colour of hair is just to make the
man even more secure that this is a dumb, blonde, bimbo.

The second reason: We are the "strong" sex.
   Have you ever talked to a man who is having a cold? I just wonder how they
survive the winters. Women can have double pneumonia and still be up, running
a home.

The third reason: We give birth to children.
   Sure, it hurts but you men are really missing out on something...

The fourth reason: A woman can do everything a man can
   A women can dress up in men's clothes, and people can say that she is
"chic." I really would like to see the man that goes to a important business
meeting in a dress. Sure, men can wear skirts - if they are Scottish. If I
were a man, I would be really jealous seeing the women in the summer. Suits
are very hot to wear in the sun.

The fifth reason: A woman don't have to think about how she acts.
   A woman is allowed to act how stupid as she like, just because she is a
woman. Women can talk about feelings without being teased for it from people
of the same sex.

I can go on forever and, because I'm a woman, I understand that you don't
want to read more.

But you have to admit that you are jealous sometimes. How many men you know
are having multiple orgasms?
