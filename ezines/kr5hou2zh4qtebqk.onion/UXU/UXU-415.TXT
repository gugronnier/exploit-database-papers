                                                        VISION FACTORY

Charles Chen flipped through the television channels.
   "Garbage, garbage, garbage..."
   He eventually found a channel that appealed to him: "Dear viewers!
Welcome to the win-whatever-you-want channel!"
   Chen put his feet on a magazine that was on the table, and leaned back in
his couch.
   "Today's question, what you see is what you get, what is this?" said the
host and held up a picture. Chen threw himself over the telephone. He
dialled the number to the channel. A machine answered, "Answer?"
   "That must be elephant, torn to pieces", Chen answered.
   "Correct."
   Chen went live directly.
   "We have a winner! Who?"
   "Chen. Charles Chen!"
   "What do you want to win, Mr. Chen?"
   "A new life."
   "Consider a gun."
   Chen went back to his couch and considered.

                                                        WORLD CLASSIFIED

Charles Chen flipped through the magazine, looking for nothing special. The
magazine never offered anything special, the reason why he always bought it.
   "Garbage, garbage, garbage..."
   A huge advertisement appeared on one of the pages.

                                THIS IS WHAT YOU SEE
                                      WHAT YOU GET IS
                             WHAT YOU WIN
                                  IS WHAT YOU WANT
                             WHAT IS THIS

   Boiling with anger, Mr. Chen called up the company who had put out the
provocative ad.
   "What do you mean? Are you insane?"
   "Consider it a bad joke related to your life."
   "Wow", Chen said, in spite of a better reply.
   Mr Chen hung up. He returned to his magazine. He noticed that there was
a show on television he would watch later that night, The Win Whatever You
Want Show.

                                               THE WORLD ACCORDING TO CHEN

Chen bought a gun and a bullet. He was determined to kill himself. Nothing
happened in his life. The salesman said: "Be careful with that piece, it can
tear an elephant to pieces!"
   Chen nodded and left the shop. Did he ever do it? According to himself,
yes. But some people said he just chewed and ate the bullet, and never
returned to his couch again.
