                     THE TERRORISTS OF DISSATISFACTION
                      by THE GNN/DualCrew-Shining/uXu


             This short file is dedicated to my beloved neighbors.


In his file 'The Anatomy of Boredom' (UXU-129), Ralph claims that the
strongest force around is boredom. Ralph writes: 'It is boredom that
make us get up and do something with our lives!'
   To a certain extent, he is right. Boredom is a strong motivational force.
   Unfortunately, boredom and frustration makes too many people do things
that ought to be considered unhealthy and dangerous to the well-being of
their fellow people. Boredom is something that makes us do something with
our lives, yes, but unfortunately it makes us not do anything _good_ with
our lives. On the contrary, boredom will prevent us, and other people, from
having a good life, if we accept the idea that we must, by necessity, be
bored and frustrated. Some people have accepted this, and these are the
terrorists of dissatisfaction. Let me explain this simple idea.

   Two of the crucial factors that constitutes a good life are happiness and
pleasure. Boredom and frustration are opposite feelings. There are people
around who actually experience a good life, but they are in minority. It
is not considered 'serious' to be happy. In fact, people who are bored and
frustrated are taking their lives more 'seriously' it is claimed - not
openly, of course, but it is what could be called an 'unwritten law'.
   It would be nothing wrong with such a law, for others, if those who obeyed
it kept it to themselves. But since they live unsatisfying lives, no one
else around them are allowed to be happy. Therefore, the terrorists of
dissatisfaction are constantly trying to terminate the happy people around
them, with various means. There is no such thing as 'mutual respect' in such
cases. The happy people must respect the demands of the dissatisfied, but
the dissatisfied need not to respect the happy people.
   A brief example: If forty-nine people, out of fifty, in a building throws
a party, one day per year, dancing and singing all night, we would say that
they are having a good time (which is not the same thing as a Good Life, but
that is not important here - the argument could be used, almost mutatis
mutandis, for the good life too.)
   However, this does not matter at all if the one who is left decides to
complain. Then this general happiness does not count at all. The poor
individual who is bored, and 'disturbed' by the loud music, is suddenly
right on all accounts. Everybody else in the house must respect and obey the
unwritten law that says that silence and boredom is the ultimate virtue.
Otherwise, the slaves (the police) of the global Institution of Boredom (the
state) will arrive and use their deadly force to end the happiness.

   So, why is frustration and boredom considered 'higher' than happiness and
pleasure? How come that a person who always complains how much stress he
experiences at work is considered more 'serious' in his life style than
someone who says that he is having a work that he fully enjoys?
   This has nothing to do with the childish claim that 'life is actually
boring.' Life is not boring. It is only boring if you make it boring. To
blame the state, the system, or some other concept that you are not really
familiar with is only a bad excuse for your own lack of imagination. This
is the core of the problem; most people are not able to think, they are not
able to do something good with their lives.
   Indeed, this is a hard thing for the dissatisfied to accept. In fact,
they will do everything they can to deny its truth. The modus operandi of
the terrorists of dissatisfaction against happiness, is, naturally, to deny
the fact that they are frustrated. Instead, they will turn the tables, and
say that they, de facto, are the ones who are having a good time, while
those who are happy are 'wasting their lives.' To regard life as a fabric
where only education, work and death are seen as the only 'serious' things to
do, while happiness is only allowed as long as it fits into this fabric, is
truly insane. It is a disease that has swallowed our society, with the help
from  the abstract thing we call 'the state' or 'the system.'
   Since I do not believe that those two concepts are completely separated
from the individual himself (my belief is that the thing we call 'the
system' is nothing more than a collective madness - and everyone is
guilty, more or less, to its existence) the ones who are responsible for the
disease are the people themselves. Life is not especially fun when everyone
is bored, but at least life is then something that is praised by those who
are not able to think for themselves: easy.

   A life that is easy requires no imagination. Everything just passes by,
like a calm river, and the only thing you have to do is to go with the
stream. Those who begin to swim will create a lot of waves, and must be
stopped so the easiness will not disappear.
   In equal, those who are happy are a threat against those who want life
to be easy. Hence, the dissatisfied people will do everything they can to
prevent people from being happy. They will spread, and indirectly accept,
the idea that it is 'serious' to be bored, dissatisfied and frustrated.
Of course, that is not the truth and it is nothing strange with the quote
'when you take life seriously, you do not take it seriously'. When you
play the game of the frustrated masses, you will end up in something that
is not, and never will be, the good life.
   'Early to rise, and early to bed, makes a man wealthy, healthy and dead.'
   But, then, how do you argue with someone who indirectly claims that life
ought to be as boring as possible? Shortly: you do not. It will just be a
waste of time without any meaning at all. If you begin to argue with some
stupid sucker, you will play the game of that person. You will become tired
and bored of talking to a human wall, and if you do it long enough you might
suddenly conform to the idea that everything ought to be boring.
   You better stay away from trying to heal the ones who want to remain ill.
Let them twist and turn in their agony, while you stick to the highest
available virtue; the good life. Never mind the bored terrorists of
dissatisfaction, they are beyond any kind of help. They will never, ever,
understand the following truism;

   "The one who wants peace and silence
   above anything else, longs for death."
