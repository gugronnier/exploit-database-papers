  Eight  months  ago, a man hung himself to death in his own apartment.  He
had  used  his  favorite  leather-tie  to end his own life that cold winter
morning.   His  choice  of  suicide was classic - death by asphyxia, he was
found  dead  in  the bathroom.  However, he was not found dead at once.  It
took  several  weeks  before  the police drilled his door open and entered,
followed by a dozen of his friends and relatives.  They practically bursted
into  the  flat,  despise the police men who desperately tried to keep them
away from the stiff corpse.
  The  scene was chaotic.  People screamed, cried and acted like maniacs in
the  small bathroom of the dead bachelor.  Obviously, the man had been very
depressed  the last months before his tragic death so friends and relatives
claimed  that  they  were  not  at  all  surprised.   He had severe alcohol
problems, they said.  We knew he was capable of doing this, they continued.
He  was  fired  from  work two days before his death, someone said.  We did
everything  we could to prevent him from doing this!  a woman yelled before
she was led away by her husband.
  It  was all true.  The man had been depressed, he had been fired from his
work.   But there was no sign of alcohol problems in the flat.  It was nice
and tidy, not dirty and covered with bottles as one might expect.
  The  dead man was twenty-five years old.  His name was John Smith.  Until
the day he was fired from work, he had been a successful mathematician at a
local computer company.  The people at the company told me that they had no
clue  about  his  drinking  problems.   However,  the boss said, we did not
notice  anything  until  his  own  mother called me up and sobbed something
about Mr Smith being a deep alcoholic.  Because of company policy, I had no
other  choice  than suspending him until he had taken care of his problems.
He had not been fired, the boss emphasized.
  His  mother  confirmed  the fact.  She had  called  the  company  her son
worked  at and explained that he was in desperate need for help to get over
his  alcohol  problems.  She had been aware of his problems for a long time
she said. She started to sob as she recalled an incident that occurred when
he  was  young.   One late night, she explained, John had stumbled into the
house  drunk,  his  belly  filled  to  the  limit  with cheap beer from the
drugstore.  He was only fourteen years old at the time.  They had talked to
him and he showed remorse.  But, she continued, it was probably only a fake
mask  she  saw  of  him  at  the  time.  She  never saw him drunk again and
they never  spoke  about the embarrassing incident until he was twenty-four
and that friend of him called her up.

  John  Smith  went  to  Gren  University  to study mathematics when he was
nineteen.  The parents was naturally very satisfied of his mature choice of
education.   He  had  to  move  very  far  away  from his home town though,
something  he  often  said  was the best thing he had ever done.  Like many
young men, John Smith early felt the urge of packing his bags and move west
to  seek  new frontiers.  The university, he said, was only his first stop.
He  would  never  return to  his home town again.  It was simply too sleepy
for him.
  He  lived at the campus of the university for four years.  He soon made a
name around the place, and everyone knew about him.  Especially, John Smith
was  known of being the hardest drinker around.  No one could ever beat him
when it came to alcohol.  Rumors said he could gulp down ten beers in a row
without  the slightest  sign  of nausea.  He was the head party-lion of the
entire campus, and perhaps even of the whole city.
  Despise  this,  Mr Smith made it all through his education with excellent
grades.   He  even claimed that he enjoyed drinking, that it was not so bad
at  all.   He  enjoyed  sitting  in a pub with his friends, chatting, while
having  a  few  beers  in  the evening.  The only thing he found boring, he
said,  was  that too many of his friends seemed to have problems.  Problems
with  girls,  their  education and sometimes even their whole life.  He did
everything  he  could to cheer them up.  But some of them was too depressed
for  salvation.   He did not like to see his friends drop out of school and
turn  into  nobodies,  just  because they suffered from a temporary lack of
reason.  But he could not do anything.  He had to get on with his own life.
  The  last  year  in  school, John lost many of his closest friends.  They
moved  away,  left  school and started new lives.  Some of them turned into
real alcoholics because of their personal problems.  When John tried to get
them  out  of their habit, they confronted him about his own drinking.  The
only  answer  John  had  was  that he enjoyed it, and had complete control,
while  they  seemed  to  just drink to forget.  No one accepted the answer.
Many  of  them tried to get John to quit drinking, but he refused.  He said
that he had no problems with alcohol.  He claimed that his friends ought to
take care of their own problems instead of creating them for him.
  Things  got  worse.  Suddenly,  John  was not allowed to drink one single
beer at the local pub because of his friends.  They constantly claimed that
it  was the best for him.  John did not mind at first, but after a while he
lost  control.   His  friends only talked to him about what they saw as his
problems,  but  he refused to listen.  When they brought up the subject the
first  time, he simply said that he was not drinking anything and there was
no  need  to  talk  about  it.  They insisted that he should talk about his
problems, but he only said that he had not got any.  You ought to take care
of your problems instead, he said and tried to remain calm.
  His friends did not give up.  They checked up on him all the time, making
sure that he was not swallowing a single drop.  John turned aggressive.  He
shouted that his friends were playing some sinister game with him.  He kept
on  saying  that  he  had  no  problems.  He kept on saying that it was his
friends that had severe problems with their lives and now they used him for
personal therapy.  His friends notified A.A. and begged them to take on the
case  of John Smith.  They did everything they could, but it only made John
more angry.
  You need help, a woman from A.A.  said with a sweet voice.
  I do not need help, John replied - clearly annoyed.
  That is what all alcoholics replies, she said.
  Listen, those who need help are my friends!  John shouted at her.
  That is what all alcoholics shout, she said.
  Leave me alone!  he cried and hung up.
  That is what all alcoholics do, she explained to John's friends.

  After he had left school, he moved to City of Glass on the east coast and
began working as a mathematician at a local computer company. When a friend
of  him  came  to  visit (to check out that he was okay),  he found John in
a  bar - drinking beer.  The  friend shouted at him to stop, but Smith just
looked  confused.   I  have  no problems, he yelled.  I am here for a quick
beer  before  I  go  home to sleep, that is all.  But his friend refused to
listen.
  The  next morning the  friend  called  John's  mother  and told her about
the  situation.  She collapsed and had to be taken to the nearest hospital.
While  she recovered, the father called John up and explained that he ought
to  quit  drinking.  It did not matter what John said, no one listened.  He
had  problems,  they  said.   Gigantic  problems.  He was an alcoholic that
wasted his life and almost had killed his own mother.
  A  few  days  later,  John's mother got home.  She immediately called the
boss at his work and told him about the tragic situation.
  Two  days  later  John  Smith  was dead and gone, hanging in his favorite
leather-tie in his tidy bathroom.  He could not stand it any more.
  The alcohol had slain him, his friends said and buried him.
