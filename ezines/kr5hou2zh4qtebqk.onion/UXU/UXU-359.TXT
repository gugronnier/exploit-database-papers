                            A Teacher's View
                               by Knyttet

To be a teacher is not the easiest thing to be in the world.
Very often, your students don't give a damn about what you are saying or what
you want them to do. You have to walk around the classroom like a guard or
cop or something like that, just to make them do some of the things they are
supposed to.

It's very difficult to motivate the pupils to study. Who needs to know about
old kings? Who needs to know how to write and speak a foreign language?
All they want is to become car mechanics, hairdressers or work at McDonald's.

I try (I am trying hard, really) to give them thousands and thousands of
reasons, why knowledge is good to have. I'm really trying to explain that
knowledge isn't a heavy burden.

But they are not interested. They can't see any further than their own nose.
They can't see any lights in their future and the worst part is - they are
totally satisfied. They are not looking for something. They are part of the
big masses which surround us all.

I'm not trying to change them because I believe that everyone has a right
to choose what they want in life. I'm just trying to give them some insight.
Help them to see beyond the things their parents show them. I just want to
give them a chance to see for themselves that it is possible to change their
life and how they actually can control their own life, their own future.

It's hard. I remember myself, at their age. Every dream in my life, every
thought in my head, was about the day I finished school and could have a job
and move to my own apartment.

I didn't care about the "higher education" everyone else planned for me
to go on with. Oh no, just get a job and get away from my parents.
I guess it's the same with these kids (or youngsters), at least in some
cases.

So what do you tell them?
