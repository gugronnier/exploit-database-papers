Hello there. I am going to write a few words about that annoying part of our
life; sleep. No matter how hard you try, you always end up having too much or
too little of it. So I started thinking, "why sleep at all?"

I counted on being extremely tired the first couple of days, but after that I
figured my body would get used to not getting any sleep. Sitting down a few
times a day, relaxing my legs would surely be a good enough substitute to
sleep - and take up less of my time as well.

The first twenty-four-hour period of being awake was easy. As soon as I felt
sleepy, I took two deep breaths and shook my head a little. No big deal.

...

I'm back. Forty-eight hours has passed now, and I'm still fit as a fiddle.
I've changed my "two deep breaths and a head shake" to "jump up and down,
wave arms and clap hands." So far, so good.

...

Seventy-two hours, here I am. Three days of no sleeping went by as any other
three days, except I have eight hours more a day to do something else. Today
I spent a total of two of those trying to keep me awake. Now I'm putting my
head in a bucket of ice cold water every time my eyelids try to convince me
to go to bed. Clapping and jumping doesn't work anymore.  It just gets me
even more tired. I'm winning though, and I think my body is more and more
accepting a life without any sleep.

...

Made it. I'm just about to cross the 96-hour line here, and I have a glass of
juice and the bucket here to celebrate. Strange, I thought my body was
tougher than this. Anyway, I changed my diet to also include some easily-
digested fruit. I hope that by decreasing my stomach activity, I will have
more energy left for keeping me awake.

...

As I'm writing this, I have been awake for five days (120 hours) straight. I
find it somewhat hard to find the words when I type. Hell,m it's even hard to
hit the right keys.I would say my typing rate has gone down about 90%But
apart from this, I feelfineMy apperens has chaged also, i might addd. I have,
should I say, clearly visible dark circles rund my eys now. I managed to
cutdown my food expenses,sinc im almost never hungry anumor.I}m thristy thou,
Ill just go down the basment and getmyself something to drensh my thirst.
