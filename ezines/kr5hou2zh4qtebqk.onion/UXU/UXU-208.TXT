                      by THE GNN/DualCrew-Shining/uXu


              "This is what you say, and this is what I hear"




  You do not know what to say? Let me teach you.

  Read on.


----------------------------------------------------------------

  *  "Has anyone ever told you that you..."


  "Yes, you mother informed me about that when I reamed her ass."

  "Yes, and he was also mentally disturbed."

  "I kill for pleasure. Just wanted you to know that."

  "Heh heh heh..."

  "I can give you the best fuck you have ever had, so be nice to me."


----------------------------------------------------------------

  *  "How could you say such a thing to him?"


  "Talent."

  "I moved my lips. Like you do now, but in a more suitable manner."

  "I just used the words that were written on his forehead."

  "He begged me to do it."

  "I just wanted him to forget his brain cancer for a few seconds."


----------------------------------------------------------------

  *  "This is the police! Open up the door!"


  "Later. I am busy flushing down things."

  "Give me your gun through the mailbox as proof!"

  "Idiot! I am the police! YOU open up the door!"

  "Darling, we are going to have pig for dinner!"

  "Onuita yrson hans aber umnasta?"


---------------------------------------------------------------

  *  "Youngster, your behavior is filthy and indecent!"


  "So is your breath granny."

  "May I have that gold that is in your mouth when you die?"

  "Your children never phone you nowadays I guess?"

  "Your children never comes home for christmas I guess?"

  "I think you have stepped into something. Oh, it was only your grave."


----------------------------------------------------------------

  *  "Turn down the music!"


  "Naturally. Tomorrow morning."

  "How come that you never complain when my wife grunts loudly in bed?"

  "You call this MUSIC? Your taste really sucks!"

  "Sorry, it is my japanese dog that barks. I call him SONY."

  "What?"


----------------------------------------------------------------

  *  "The world would look much better if it was ruled by women!"


  "Margret Thatcher."

  "Do you think they got the BALLS for that kind of work?"

  "Sorry, I am not into masochism."

  "Just try. Har har har!"

  "What are you doing here? Get back to the kitchen!"


----------------------------------------------------------------

  *  "... and that was what I had to say!"


  "I bet you are a BIG Lee Marvin-fan, aren't you?"

  "MY GOD, YOU ARE UGLY!"

  "Are you stoned or something?"

  "Stop pretending! Be yourself!"

  "I am the third reincarnation of Jesus and I can prove it."


----------------------------------------------------------------

  *  "May I come in?"


  "Sure! We need one more person for our weekly group-sex orgy!"

  "Only if you help me in the search for my mad snake."

  "Not now. I am busy masturbating."

  "Hold on while I go to my bedroom and ask your wife."

  "No."

----------------------------------------------------------------

  *  "Are you looking for trouble?"


  "Me? No! I do not want to soil my boot knife!"

  "No, but you are looking at it."

  "Actually I do. I must prove for the mafia that I can kill."

  "No, I am just good-looking."

  "Watch it. This floor is very slippery. You might fall."


----------------------------------------------------------------

  *  "What the fuck is uXu?"


  "Nothing you have to worry about. You must learn to read first."

  "Three letters. U, U and X."

  "You know about uXu? Sorry, but the government demands that I kill you."

  "The re-union of the Beatles."

  "Just say no to drugs! JUST SAY NO! IMBECILE! FOOL! DANCE! SING!"


----------------------------------------------------------------


  That is all! I hope you feel much wiser now.
