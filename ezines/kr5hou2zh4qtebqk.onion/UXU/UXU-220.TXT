*   The intro.           "You'll pay for it. With your life."

*   Due to the fact that our own personal favorite editor The Chief has
*   been too busy during the past months, this impressively delayed release
*   had to be constructed and engineered by the faithul Phearless.
*   This time, we present to you three new stars on the uXu heaven;
*   Leon Felkins, Dee Philipp Binggeli and McCoy. Naturally, we also dare
*   to give you files from the standard crew; Ralph, The GNN and Phearless.
*   We certainly hope that this release will be found pleasant and satisfy
*   your most primitive needs for knowledge and karma. But do remember;
*   not everything that we want to tell you will be found in the words and
*   letters alone.
*
*                                                   The summer's gone!
*                                               The GNN & Phearless / uXu


    uXu, through Anonymous ftp?  uXu Mailing List?  Fsp?

    True! All files (0-220) are available from the sites listed at the end
    of this file. These sites will get the new releases after the people
    on the Mailing-List have received their packages.

    If you have an Internet address, you can subscribe to uXu (and request
    back-issues) by E-Mailing uxu-info-request@lysator.liu.se. When you
    request back-issues, please list the number(s) of the issue(s) instead
    of title(s). Example:

    Subject: uXu BACK-ISSUES

    Body: 220,001,215,091,032

    To subscribe, just let the body of the letter contain the word
    "SUBSCRIBE", and every new release will be mailed to you as soon
    as it is ready. Simple and easy.


    uXu Copyright Notice?

    We're sorry to have to add this notice to our files, but it was
    necessary. Please read through the small but informative notice
    at the end of this textfile and believe us when we tell you that
    it had to be done. There's absolutely no respect these days.


    Easy way to find what's new.

    At the far left-side of the index files, there are asterisks "*",
    which let you know what's new since last time. You don't have to
    read through the whole index for the latest info, just scan the
    file for the asterisks.

        Be a part of the uXu team!  Here's what you need to know...
   ---------------------------------------------------------------------

   private mail to The Chief for further information (if needed) or to
   let us know you'd like to join. Don't hesitate! Call today! Slaves of
   The Net -> E-Mail The Chief (address at the end of the file).


   Member -->  We're happy if you write a minimum of two files/release.
               You do have to write something for each release to be
               listed as Member.

   Contributor -->  We don't expect you to write for each release. You
                    write when you have something to write about. We do
                    want you to write something for every 3 releases
                    to be listed as Contributor.

*  Distribution Site -->  To become a distribution site, we have to check
*                         your BBS first, so include name/number/speed/
*                         sysop handle and nup (if there is one) when
*                         applying.

*                         As a support board, you'll have one file-area
*                         for and with all currently available uXu files
*                         and one where submissions/contributions to uXu
*                         may be uploaded by your users. Password protected
*                         files are okay too.

*                         The first BBS that applies (and gets an 'OK') in
*                         each country becomes that country's uXu "head-
*                         quarters", with whatever sneaky advantages that
*                         may bring.

*                         It's a + if you have access to the internet.

April  August  April  August  April  August  April  August Releases 1994:

205: "Big Bang Phil" by The GNN. Chemistry class was always fun. The fear
in the teacher's eyes combined with the smell of something burning, how
we laughed. This Phil guy is one who prefer practical experiments to
theoretical.

206: "The Nightfly" by The GNN. Futuristic view on censorship in the
extreme. This little night talker has other things to worry about than
losing his air license. Feed your mind with these brand new bytes of art.

207: "Review: 'Bolero' by Jordan Lee" by Dee Philipp Binggeli. Our new
writer, the multimedia enthusiast Dee P Binggeli, manage to catch jazz
guitarist for a chat. This file contains a fresh interview with Jordan
Dee himself and a review of his latest album 'Bolero'. A must for fans
and music addicts.

208: "What To Say" by The GNN. Here it is. For people that never seem to
end a conversation the right way. Here's how to end one, quick and with
the usual smile guarantee. Prepare yourself for the next battle, as it
will come to you eventually.

209: "Speech For The Defence" by The GNN. Hell, one day you might be there
yourself. You never know, suddenly you _will_ realize that things are not
what they appear to be. Of course you only need to prove it. To yourself,
and to everyone else.

210: "How To Avoid Getting Hangover" by McCoy. Does the room spin when
you wake up and do you experience the sensation of being more thirsty
than the big bad wolf? Do you spend more than one hour trying to get out
of bed, just to step into your own vomit? Then do not worry! Crawl to
your computer, turn it on, and carefully read this file and you will
probably survive the day. Probably.

211: "Three Rendez-vous With The Men Of Power" by The GNN. Psychological
hardcore thriller by the most flexible writer we have in our staff. Easy
to read - hard to understand - very tough to believe. As always, it is
up to the reader what is to be taken seriously or not.

212: "Population X" by The GNN. Just because you can't see things doesn't
prove they are non-existant. Just because you can't believe in something
doesn't prove it isn't true. If something exists, does that prove that
it's real?

213: "Poetry Collection 1" by Bob Slack. Bob Slack returns after a while
of silence with this collection of poetry that mixes humble views at
the present situation with powerful explosions of anger.

214: "Poetry Collection 2" by Bob Slack. Some people say that poetry is
boring and a waste of time. Well, read these nine poems from our poetry-
meister and I can assure that you will change your mind.

215: "Poetry Collection 3" by Bob Slack. Love is always a good source
for inspiration. Luckily for us, Bob Slack recently stumbled over Karen,
who obviously is a real cutie pie, since he spoils us with yet another
bunch of poetry! Enjoy.

216: "Fuck You, Stefan Kronqvist" by The GNN. Personal opinions, or the
opinions of an entire generation? Do you know who Your "Stefan Kronqvist"
is? He will get to you, in one way or the other - and leave with or without
your mind, knowledge and perhaps even your life.

217: "Psycho(logical)scope" by Phearless. Who are you? What will you
become? From the basic facts you know about yourself, this file will
rape your mind and blow your top until it leaves you with the rational
understanding about yourself. Yes, the truth hurts.

218: "Everything You Need To Know About Techno" by Ralph 124C41+. The
fact remains: being a techno-fan is not easy at all. You must educate
yourself unless you want to make a fool of yourself in public. This file
will help you. Should be read while listening to anything that goes at
200 bpm or more.

219: "The Voter's Paradox" by Leon Falkins. How many of your decisions
in your life were made upon what You know and what You feel? Are you sure?
Think again. This is definitely recommended reading for the hungry.

220: "uXu Index #18" by Phearless & The GNN. The Chief: We didn't plan it
this way! Most people like organized and formatted collections. I know that,
because I'm a collector myself. Therefore, we made the index files as a part
of each release, with statistics, updates and descriptions. For those who
want this sort of stuff. For the collector, and for the reader. Nice to see
some of you actually reading this right now. Well, I can tell you it's about
time to get this show on the road, so I'll leave you with some more stuff
you already know about:

          - An introduction about current events by The Chief.
          - Updated Writer and Support Board Lists.
          - An updated uXu Hall of Thanks and Honorary Member List.
          - An updated list of all uXu files in Short format.
          - In-depth descriptions of the new files.
          - An updated list of places where to contact uXu.

      [#220 also includes an Index for the uXu-S and DSR series]
