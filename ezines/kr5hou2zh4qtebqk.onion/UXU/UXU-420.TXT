Life is,    by Bravemoore




Life is ...

... like a log of shit. You are happily floating around with your friends in
    your pool, when suddenly and without warning you are flushed away.

... like a nail. You stand up, proud to be what you are when suddenly your
    head is at feet level.

... like sex. One moment you're having it, the next - you're not.

... like limited warranty. When you need it and want it the most,
    you can't have it because it's too late.

... like an old car. When you really get to know it, you like it. But when
    you really are getting to like it, it falls to pieces.

... like writing a text file. It looks good until you write it down, and
    examine it closer. You then agree with yourself that you can do better.

... really great.
