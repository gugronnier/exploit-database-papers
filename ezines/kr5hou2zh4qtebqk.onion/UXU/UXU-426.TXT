                         Neighbor trouble II

It's been a week now, and I am still annoyed by my... well, let's just
call them my neighbors. Every day when I come home, the dogs bark like
mad and the heap of kids cry and shout until I go to sleep. In fact,
I'm so exhausted by it all that by the time I manage to drag my body
to the bed, sleep is all I can do.

Since the day I really noticed them, my room - no, the whole house, has
been painted with the smell of their cooking. It really stinks! Most of
the time I can't even recognize the smells of what's being cooked. And
when I do recognize it, my stomach turns.

But that's not all. These people dress funny. They wear old clothes in
the most disgusting colors. The funny part is, however, that they are the
ones staring at me when I pass them now and then. Staring and pointing
at me, as if I was the one with the strange clothes!

I remember they only had the one dog once. And I almost only noticed it
when I saw it running around playing in the back yard. Now they have at
least five, and they are never quiet. Constant barking and howling.
It was the same story with the kids. Just one at first, and then
suddenly, there were five of them too.

I tried to call some of my friends to ask them for help. But they laughed
and told me to get used to my situation. They said they couldn't do
anything about it, and that it was completely up to me. I could only
blame myself for the situation I was in, and the only sound advice they
could give was for me to move.

That was an option I hadn't considered. Because I kind of liked the house,
my room with the big oak tree just outside the window. And I thought
everything would calm down and that they all would be nicer to have around
after a while. And after all, moving to a new place can be quite
an ordeal. Something I wasn't quite ready to do. Not yet.

I tried to call the landlord, but the line was always busy. Day and night.
I didn't have to worry though. He lived down on the first floor, so the next
time I met him in the stairs I tried to talk to him. But he just shook his
head and said he didn't understand a word of what I was saying. Took me
for a punk. A troublemaker. "Bad smell? Hell you're lucky people still have
enough money to buy food!" So I gave up on him.

I managed to control myself for another six months, but then came the day
I realized that they would probably never move. And they would probably
never calm down. In fact, it had even been getting worse. That's when I went
down the stairs to pay them a visit. After a while I heard voices from their
bedroom, so I gently opened the door and said; "- Mom, Dad, I'm moving out."
