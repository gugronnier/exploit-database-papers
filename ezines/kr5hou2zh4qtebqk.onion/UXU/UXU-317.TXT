Daddy's Girl

Why did he always push things so hard?
Why did he always hurt her so bad?
She knew that the easiest way out was to avoid situations like this, and she
had tried that, but it wasn't always possible.
This time, it had been one of those impossible ones.
And like it always ended, it ended this time too.
At least she didn't cry very much, but long enough to let him see that
he still possessed the ability to make her, this way, with only a few
words.
She hated it.
She didn't hate him, but she hated this feeling for sure.
And she hated the fact that there was nothing she could do about it.

She remembered the time they had been fighting over the phone, when she
didn't want to go to her grandma's 70th birthday, his mum's birthday.
She had known it would be a fight, but she didn't think it would be
that big.
She was only about 16 when this happened, and he was past his 40's.
They were arguing on the phone for quite a while until he got so mad
that he threw down the receiver.
She remembered thinking, how low can he get, I don't even hang up on my
boyfriends when they pissed me off.
Then he rang again, asked her younger sister to put her on the
phone.
He just said one sentence: "-You are so selfish" and then he hung up
again.
After this she was really sad and frustrated, she had always been
daddy's little girl, but after this?
She wrote him a letter. She had always had the ability to write though
the spoken word wasn't really hers, and placed it at his place on the
kitchen table.
She expected him to come up to her room as soon as he came home.

He didn't.
She could hear the family downstairs, packing.
She was sure he would come up, sooner or later.
He didn't.
Instead he sent her mother, crying and saying something about her
going to be the reason for a divorce (why, she didn't understand, and
still don't understand).

It all ended up in that they all went to her grandma's (or his MUM's
birthday), a very quiet family in a big car.
After this everything was ruined, except his ability to make her cry.
That he still possessed.
