  your friends tells you not to do some of the things you do;  because
  they are dangerous and deadly games;  drugs;  fights;  crimes;  things
  that will either kill you or send you to jail;  but that is the whole
  point;  your friends fail to see that;  they fail to live their lives
  in the fast lane;  that is the name of the game;  because if you do
  not experience the ultimate life;  you experience no life at all;  how
  can you say that you have a good life;  if you do not know what life
  is;  how can you die in peace;  if you have never seen the face of death
  before;  how do you manage to stay alive;  if you do not constantly risk
  to lose it;  you see;  quantity can never outrun quality;  and therefor
  you ought to do the things you do;  more or less;  (which is perhaps the
  same reason why you read this text;)  the never ending search for the
  ultimate experiences;  which always takes different forms;  but yet must
  be lethal to keep you alive;  kicks
