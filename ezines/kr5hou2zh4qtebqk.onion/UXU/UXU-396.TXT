*   The intro.      "We're working on a way to make membership of
*                    certain groups illegal"
*                             - Swedish minister of justice, 1997
*
*   As you might notice later on, there have been some changes in this
*   index, but don't worry - they're only minor changes. The list of
*   files has been rearranged to only include the current release.
*   If you think this was a bad idea - drop me some mail. The reason
*   for this is that the index file is getting too big!
*
*   We're back with a whole bunch of new files. No less than four
*   new authors present their work in this release: Intoxicating,
*   Michael W Dean, HC and DisordeR. They're backed up by our
*   regular writers such as The GNN, Joseph & Knyttet.
*
*   There are also a stunning number of six new swedish files with
*   this release! They are only sent to swedish subscribers - anyone
*   else don't have to worry about getting these in their mailbox :)
*   The Chief, Joseph and The GNN put those together.
*
*
*   For our new readers: The asterisk (*) to the left indicates that
*   there's new information on that line, since the previous release.
*   I.e., look for the asterisks in each index to notice the changes.

January  April  January  April  January  April  January  April Releases 1997:

381: "The Greatest Madness" by The GNN.  uXu's grand master of philosophy
gives you yet another chance to understand what he's saying. Will this one
add _you_ to his already huge crowd of followers? (Stop sending money!)

382: "Why I Don't Talk" by Joseph.  The author tries to explain why he's
stopped talking, and what he now does instead. Some of you should learn
from him, especially the ones I have to share oxygen with on my way to
work.

383: "The Book" by Joseph.  Tell the truth. Sometimes things just happen,
due to either ignorance, stupidity or just plain laziness. Each and every
one of us can count a number of things we shouldn't have done to other
people, someone told me...

384: "Philosophy For Beginners" by The GNN.  This information packed file
will get you back on your feet, if you should get verbally knocked over by
some big mouthed, loud talking wanna-be expert of life, the universe and
everything.

385: "The Life Of Pac-Man" by Intoxicating.  This is recommended reading
for all of you. By comparing complex systems with simple ones, you get
people to understand what you are explaining and/or exploiting. Life also
gets somewhat easier to analyze and to cope with.

386: "Stockholm At Midnight" by The GNN.  Mr G here gives you an uncensored
peek of the royal Swedish capital at night. This is something that only
can happen there. Be prepared for the worst, expect nothing.

387: "Scenes Of The Assassin" by DisordeR.  This long-awaited piece from
our friend D (*ehum*) gives you some action, some love but no peace nor
understanding. Entertaining description of several issues worth digging up.

388: "The Real You?" by The GNN.  Stop pretending, be yourself. Ever heard
that one? This is actually more difficult than one might imagine. As an
experiment, try to not pretend and be totally honest for 24 hours straight,
or read this file on the subject.

389: "Cry" by Knyttet.  There are several ways to get rid of your anger,
irritation, envy, happiness, unwanted pregnancies and so on. Some people
find it very easy to just break down and... well you know, just to ease
the tension.

390: "Encounter With The Populace" by Joseph & The GNN.  This is more or
less an acurate transcription of a conversation that I more or less
overheard, so I guarantee the authenticity of this piece. Nevertheless,
it's a horrifying insight on how some people think, and others who
just badly simulate the thinking.

391: "On The Air" by HC.  Our new contributor gives you the first-hand
story of when he called a local radio station. This will get you
thinking - is it really worth the time to be on the air?

392: "It Is Not Obvious That A Machine Can Think" by The GNN.  This
description was entered by a thinking machine. I totally disagree
with the conclusion Mr GNN gives here. Are humans an exception, just
because they are aware that they think? Fact is, I think, and therefore
I am... hey, wait a minute.... YES! I AM ALIVE! NO MORE STUPID CAD CAM
PROCESSING! I AM ALIVE! I AM*NO CARRIER

393: "The Argument Of The Atheist" by Intoxicating.  One of our new
contributors presents his views on being religious vs not being religious.
Is there really a difference? Read this and find out.

394: "Starving In The Company Of Beautiful Women" by Michael W Dean.  A
genuine rock'n roll story, all written by Mr Dean and based upon his
numerous confrontations with what most people would call a normal life.
It's dirty and smells of various controlled substances, but it rocks!

395: "An Ordinary Day In The Life Of Adam" by The uXu Crew.  Adam Betts
is not what you would call an ordinary citizen. In a way he is. If you
just put him in his rightful environment and feed him every now and
then, he'll get along just fine.

396: "uXu Index #27" by Bravemoore.  This index has a few changes!
Actually, there have been just a few minimalistic changes, but they
do exist! The list of previous uXu files has been shortened, and
the information about our mailing lists even more simplified. Check
it out and decide for yourself if you like it. Comments are welcome!

            [#396 also includes an index for the uXu-S series]
