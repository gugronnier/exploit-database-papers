NOTE. This text is written for complete morons. If you consider yourself
      able to think, you do not need to read any further.
      Normally, no underground expert would ever embarrass him/herself by
      writing this kind of unnecessary truths for a small audience of
      fools, but right now it is a matter of our whole existence as a
      electronic magazine. So, we are forced to make an exception. We do
      not want our readers to believe that we think of them as idiots, so
      please remember that this file is not for everyone. It is for a small
      bunch of paranoid humans that want to terminate every united
      underground expert in the world. Including you.




   Listen carefully, this file is about two things: 'Underground eXperts
United' and 'Swedish Hackers Association.' Lately, some people have exposed
their lack of common sense by claiming that these two groups are involved
with each other. uXu is, they say, a 'cover' for S.H.A. Hence, uXu is also
a 'criminal organization' and ought to be banned from the world at once.
But since hearsay is not, unfortunately, a valid proof in court uXu must
first be closely investigated. Investigations are at this very moment in
progress.
   Let me now for a moment turn your attention to some facts: uXu is not a
cover for S.H.A. uXu is uXu, a magazine. uXu is not a hacker group. We
write 'textfiles'. What you read now is a 'textfile'. (If there are some
words you do not understand, please contact us and we will gladly explain.)

   However, some of the files published via the uXu magazine may be regarded
as controversial. We love to debate society, politics and ethics. But we
are neither left-winged nor right-winged. We are not politicians, we are
realists. Some people do not fancy the fact that we dare to question
accepted truths on good and evil, right or wrong. So, they regard us as
renegades. That is no problem for us, we write for people that are able to
think - people who know that it is healthy to criticize.
   If we were a cover for S.H.A, why do we write short stories and articles
about ethics and politics? Why are there no files about how to hack? Why
are there no files about how to make viruses? Why are there no files about
how to find pirated software? Why?
   When uXu write about hacking we do it in a very different way (*). Since
we are children of the computer revolution we understand that hacking is
not merely a crime, as a terrorist bomb is not merely a fire-cracker that
goes boom. What are the social/political/anthropological etc aspects of
hacking? Is hacking only a crime or is it the only way to avoid a future
kafkaesque police state ruled by Big Brother himself? We like to ask and
debate such questions. We want our readers to read and form an opinion.
But no one is forced to accept our conclusions, as people in 'real life'
are forced to accept that when the government says 'Jump!' you should ask
'How high?'
   We do not censor ourselves. We never ask ourselves 'Will people really
understand our files?' Because we know that many people will understand and
that only a few will not. Unfortunately, we have just noticed that those
who do not enjoy to think are in such positions in society that they can
kill every underground expert in less than one second and get away with
it, since they hide behind the veil of power. Perhaps this file will make
things even worse, because no animal (even though it wears a black suit)
enjoys to be provoked. If you want to mess with the underground experts, you
will soon discover that we will never bring a knife to a gun fight.
   We will bring pen and paper.

   Some people fear the unknown. They do not want to fumble in the dark, so
they get themselves a stick to be able to feel the surroundings. Since they
are not able to actually see what their stick bumps into, they convince
themselves that it is only good things. There are no ghosts in the dark,
they say. But then uXu brings a light and uncovers some nasty ghosts which
leads to confusion and fear. So, instead of looking at the ghosts and chase
them away, people quickly close their eyes and tries to smash our lamp. Life
is much easier if you believe that it is simple and uncomplicated. Believe
in Jesus, trust your friendly police man, obey the government, follow the
book of utilitarian rules, and everything will work out fine. If you break
the rules, you are a criminal.
   If you dare to question Jesus, the police man, the government and the
book of rules, then you are a potential criminal who tries to turn the
world into anarchy and chaos, only restricted by the fact that you have not
yet succeeded.
   We will not turn off our light. We will continue to write textfiles. If
some fool tries to stop us by spreading stupid lies, we will naturally
fight back. Our mission is to minimize the level of stupidity in the world
by letting people know about the real nature of things. We want people to
know that it is actually allowed to ask 'why' when someone says 'jump.'

   There is no hellish conspiracy between Underground eXperts united and
Swedish Hackers Association. As far as I know, S.H.A does not even exist
nowadays. uXu, however, exists and will do so until someone kills us with
gasoline on a dusty road. The only conspiracy that has the word 'uXu'
written on its forehead is the one that wants to stop us. All means seems
to be allowed in this fight, but uXu will never do anything more than write
textfiles at the front line. Any brain-damaged clown can handle a sword, but
only a few can handle a pen. Thankfully, the pen is often stronger than the
sword.

   Always remember: Order is high, but truth is even higher.
