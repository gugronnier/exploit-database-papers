   And  there I walked around like a swine.  I wore a filthy coat, a filthy
head and a stomach that demanded rum.  Not to mention cola.  It seemed like
everyone  had  left,  leaving  me  alone  walking  the  street.  But when I
suddenly  turned  my  head  around  it  appeared  that  I had made some new
friends.   We  all  know  how it feels when something is Perfect; that girl
looks  at you in a 'special way', that car that really is Yours, and so on.
This place was my lady who watched me with beautiful eyes while relaxing in
the shiny car that did not pollute the environment.  I turned to the Divine
wind and walked towards the door.
   Before  I  stepped inside I heard that there was a lot of people talking
there (and that usually means that no one actually cares if someone enters,
since  the  place  is  pretty  crowded from start).  Therefor, I decided to
perform a gracious entry.
   Fiasco.  Just when I was about to swing the door open, I dropped my left
glove on the ground.  I bent down to pick it up while mumbling some naughty
curses.
   It was then my forehead violently banged into someones face.
   The  only thing I saw of the poor individual was that he resembled me of
that  singer in Cameo (you know, the one with massive mutton-chop whiskers,
who  wears a jockstrap on the outside of his pants).  He buried his face in
his  hands  and  bent forward in pain, while his friends watched me as if I
was huge and dangerous.
   Something  had  to be done.  And it had to be done fast.  I bent down to
check  this  guy  out,  to  see  if  he needed help (people are usually not
allowed  to do that, since the victim might be afraid that he will get more
coming  to him.  Or worse - he might be very pissed off).  He was obviously
not  aware  of my friendly move, because suddenly he moved his head upward.
Blood  squirted  out  of my nose as his head crashed into it.  My upper lip
was  pushed  into my teeth and left me with the taste of blood in mouth and
throat.  I can stand the sight of blood, but not the smell of it.
   His friends hesitated with the attack, the guy stared at me.
   I understood that I was in deep shit.
   They  all  wore  some  kind  of white rubber and I began wondering where
exactly in the city I were.  My opponents rubber had red spots all over it,
obviously  mine  and  his mutual blood.  At the time, I imagined that I had
spilled  quite  much  over  him.   But  as  we  all know, things get pretty
exaggerated in situations like this.
   We  stared  at  each other, bleeding.  Then he just made his way past me
and  walked  away.   His  friends looked at me as if I were some alien from
outer space before they joined him.
   He  took  it  quite  well, I thought, and began wiping the blood off me.
With my coat.

  I  finally  found another place (a disco for people who were fifteen) and
entered. By some idiotic reason I believed that there might be some alcohol
available  there.   Not  that they would sell anything - but some kid might
have some.  I walked around to different people and asked them, and after a
short  while a guy offered me beer.  I did not know what to say (I was busy
wondering  what  this  generation meant).  The guy looked at me as if I was
too stupid to say a simple 'yes' or 'no'.  I finally turned his offer down,
destroying  his  chance  to  make  a few bucks, and walked away looking for
nothing.   I sat down to organize my thoughts, but it was impossible due to
the fucking music.  I wanted to leave.
   Then  a  marvellous  opportunity  showed  up.   Like  in a dream, a lady
emerged  from  the  dance floor, her eyes looked like water (I just love to
bath  and  swim).   She  wore a two-part dress (that looked like shit), and
looked like shit, I believe, but she...  well...  you know.  She approached
me and she 'was mine'.
   She was also rather angry.
   "Who the fuck are you?  And what the fuck are you doing here?"
   I immediately got a grip of the situation.  She obviously thought that I
was  a  pederast, or yet another dealer who tried to push drugs to the kids
there.   I wanted to kiss her.  I have never ever wanted to kiss someone so
much in my life, but I knew that if I...
   "I needed-ne-eed, er, water or something.  I must...  ouch, dahrn."
   My  mouth  felt  as  if  it was in several pieces.  I could only feel an
intense pain when I spoke.
   "I need to talk to you," I continued.  "I need help"
   I  glanced towards the nearest toilet and rushed to it.  She followed me
with her eyes, but did not come after me.  I ran inside and met three girls
who sat there for a smoke.  They screamed at me, waving their little hands,
demanding me to leave.  I asked them to shut up if they did not want to see
my aggressor.  I grabbed some water out of the sink and coughed up a little
marble of blood.  The marble had a long string attached to it that hung far
down  my  throat.   It  tickled  too  much for me.  I cannot stand that.  I
barfed straight into the sink and ran out.
   Outside the toilet, I crashed into The Perfection who fell to the floor.
Suddenly I understood that she was not right.  Ten years from now she would
be wrong.  I headed for the door, feeling beer cans and other various items
being  thrown at my back.  I felt pain and left for the other place (stupid
idea, since it was there my pain begun).  I ran to the place.  I was afraid
of fifteen-year old people.  Or perhaps I was afraid of the lack of alcohol
in a very traumatic situation?
   When I was there I opened the door. I was badly shocked. I even fainted,
and everything (naturally) turned black.

   Then  I suddenly felt that I was sleeping in my own bed, at home.  But I
was  wrong.  I was on the floor at the place.  There was alcohol by my side
together  with  a rather cute lady.  Smiling faces stared at me.  Everybody
were  dressed  as  if  there had been some renaissance of the eighties.  By
that I mean strange clothes.  But I did not care.
   My clothes were sweaty, I felt blood in my mouth and my nose was blocked
up.  I tried to say something, but my lips refused the order.
   "Don't  try  to say something," a girl with pink glasses said, "You have
blood in your throat.  Try to rinse it away."
   She gave me a beer and it actually tasted quite good.  I normally detest
beer, but this one was actually good.
   "Omph."
   "What's he talking about?" a girl asked.
   I  noticed  that  the place was completely silent.  No one said a single
word.  Everybody was studying me.  I almost started to cry.
   Then  I heard voices from outside.  "I will...  If I see him I will slay
him  at once.  That's the deal.  No, shut up, I do not give a fuck what you
say!  When I see him, he is dead!"

   I  knew it was Cameo.  I fainted again.  The last thing I saw was a face
that had fought to keep me awake, but failed.
