                                   Year of fun


    March does offer cold and hot. Choosing yourself you may not. Cops and
          robbers down the street. One face victory, one defeat.

    April gives the city thrills. Hide and seek up in the hills. Junkie
          chasing his next fix. Never saw this in the flicks.

    May is running from the cold. Dollars made you very bold. Never freezing,
        always burning. Stomach is already turning.

    June would never be like this. Give away your final kiss. Pile of guns
         on your backyard. Nice to have this plastic card.

    July could be more of joy. Seldom leave your pretty toy. Wish of hope,
         hope for life. Hiding with your butcher knife.

    August snow is falling down. Cooling off the big old town. Hunters
           seek but they all fail. Never will you leave a trail.

    September your favorite eves. Pain arrives and then it leaves. All is
              constant in this place. Memories carved into your face.

    October seem to never change. However odd, it is never strange. Help
            those who have less. Desire growing to confess.

    November coming on strong. Brother keeps on doing wrong. Awake when you
             sleep, sleeping when at work. Tell me Miss was that a flirt?

    December puts it under snow. Who is friend, who is foe? Realize when it
             is too late. Both knew you were to be her fate.

    January gives you chocolate. Mind to become fuzzy and all wet. Life is
            getting all too clear. Is there anything to fear?

    February ends vacation. Arriving at the big hard station. Ignores
             advice of what is fair. Never cared for this steel chair.
