 Running, running. A quick look over my shoulder confirms that they are
 still catching in on me. Oh God how did I get myself into this? It feels
 like I've been running forever. My lungs are about to explode, my heart
 sounds more and more like the wings of a hummingbird. My ears hurt, my
 feet burn but my numb legs just keep on running, running. A soft breeze
 cools off my skin, but only for a second. The moist air and the hot sun
 make my sweat boil again. Every breath tear up my throat and my tongue
 feels like a dried out fish. My vision blurs each time my feet hit the
 hard concrete and I am desperately searching for a reason to just stop.
 I'm too deep in pain to start thinking now. The invisible hand in my back
 just keeps on pushing me. Right now I don't think I'll ever stop, though
 what's left of my common sense tells me "just wait and see, friend."

   I love to run, but I think it's becoming more than just a part of my
 lifestyle. It is becoming me. I'm not sure how many more marathons I
 will compete in, just that it'll be one more after this one. Running
 makes me feel invincible and powerful. When I'm not, I feel vulnerable
 and powerless.

   Sometimes I get really depressed and cry when I realize that my running
 is only doing myself any good, not anyone else. I feel useless.
   After some time I forget my crying and pick up running again, but the
 thoughts are more or less always present. I've however become an expert
 when it comes to rejecting them.

 Running, running.
