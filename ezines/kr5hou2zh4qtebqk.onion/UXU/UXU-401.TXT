Die Old and Avoid Accidents?    by Bravemoore


This is the document you've been waiting for. There is still
hope for all your dreams of a long, happy life. There are, however,
some small "sacrifices" you'll have to implement in your way of living.

  No. No fancy diet, no exercise or anything like it.

  Look around yourself. You see people of all ages dying everywhere.
Why did they die? Why didn't someone else die you ask yourself.
Perhaps somebody close to you died, and you got real angry and wished
that someone "less important" died instead?

  There is, of course, a way of avoiding dying young: consciousness.
It might seem easy, but it's more difficult than you think. I will
describe how you can avoid accidents. How not to get injured in one,
nor getting killed.

  The one thing you have to remember at all times is: AS LONG AS YOU
ARE CONSCIOUS OF WHAT YOU ARE DOING AND WHERE YOU ARE, YOU'RE NEVER
GOING TO GET HURT.

  Now how is this possible? One way of explaining this is by showing
how the human mind copes with traumatic events; memories from just
before a shock are conveniently blocked out. This is because
they didn't pay attention to what was happening, prior their
accident. It doesn't matter if they saw it coming or not, the bottom
line is: be aware and you'll be fine.

  Accidents happen when one or more people act on routine and by
instinct, i.e. the human auto pilot. Merely walking around thinking
"I am aware of what I'm doing right now" is not enough though.

  A good start is if you start using all your senses. At all times,
be aware of the information that your senses gather. Don't just
hear, smell, feel, see and taste - try to actually pay attention
to what they register.

  A gust of wind, in which direction? A distant noise, where from and
what was it? A movement in your neighbor's window, what was it?
Try to look past the unimportant impressions - you will do this
unconsciously after some practising.

  After some time, you will notice when accidents are about to occur,
and with this knowledge, you can easily avoid getting hurt yourself.

  This way of being semi-conscious of almost all events taking place
around you, will not fully protect you from some kinds of "accidents",
such as stick-ups, assaults and such. Why? Because they are not the
result of people acting on routine.

  You will, however, not put yourself in situations where you are
not in control and your fate is in somebody else's hands.

  To see how good your abilities have become, try this simple test.

  1) find ten things in the room where you are right now, that you
     haven't noticed before (e.g. furniture scratch marks, patterns
     in the ceiling)
  2) try to identify ten sounds you hear right now (e.g. clocks,
     ambience, people)
  3) try to identify ten scents (this could be tough if you've been
     in the same room for more than a couple of minutes. Walk in to
     another room and try this instead.)

  The quicker and easier you finish this test, the better. If you
become really good, try this test where ever you are. When you
think this test has become too easy, you are fully trained to face
the world with a new weapon: your aware mind.

Stay out of trouble.
