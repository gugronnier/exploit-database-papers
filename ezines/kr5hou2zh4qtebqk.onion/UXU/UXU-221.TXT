                          "lonely eyes, lonely face
                          I thought that I
                          was all there was to be"
                                      (Waits, Tom)



  What  we cannot accomplish in our real lives, we live out in fake worlds.
Worlds, created by others or by our selves.  Movies, music, books, alcohol,
drugs.   They  may all help us to escape from our boring selves and turn us
into  something  extra.   Fantasy and imagination, for those who are gifted
with  that  special  feature.   No  man would stand reality as it really is
forever.   We  call  it  entertainment,  but  in  the end it is a result of
frustration.   It  is  the  escape  macabre for creatures who are painfully
aware of their situation.  It is a human disease.
  We  want so much we can never have, and that hurts.  Since we only have a
brief  moment in this world, we know that it would be a waste to do nothing
at all.  But there is no point in just doing anything, we must do something
special.   What is this thing called 'special'?  Is it necessary the search
for  affection  from other people, the hunt for power and profit?  Perhaps.
However, it  seems as if  they  are  only  instruments  for  the real goal;
satisfaction.   The  feeling  that  one  have  actually  done  this special
something in the short  moment  of  consciousness.  The search becomes more
complicated  as  we realize that there are no clear rules of what is extra,
something  special.  Time flies, we have not got the time to find that out.
We lean back on what we regard as other people's desires. We try to analyse
what  others believe is good and evil, right or wrong.  Then we try to live
by their rules.
  We  live  in  a  paradox, because we ought to be more aware of what we as
individuals want to do than what other people wants us to do.  We have more
contact  with  our  own sensations than others.  But we do not dare to take
the  risk  to trust ourselves.  Maybe we have desires that no one else has.
If we live by our own intuitions there might be a chance that they will not
be  accepted  by the majority.  If our life style is not accepted - instead
rejected  -  by  the population,  we  will never receive any affection, nor
satisfaction.   Hence,  we  play  by the rules of other people and keep our
dreams to the fake worlds.
  It  is  the  escape macabre, because almost everybody live like this.  We
watch the goals of other people and make them our own.  Even if we hate the
goals, the idea of life being mere work, we do not dare to stand out of the
crowd.   We do not fancy people who are not like ourselves and we know that
other people think  the same.  Therefor, we conform and join the crowd, the
majority, the population.
  In  front  of  a  movie,  a  word  processor or a bottle of whiskey it is
different.  There we can live in worlds that  do  not exist, but appeals to
us.   There,  we  will  escape the hard reality for a moment and spend some
time  in  a better world.  In the real world we may not create much, but as
soon as we rush away to dream land we will become kings and queens.
  "You  shall  not try to be someone else," people say.  "You should always
strive to be yourself."
  Be  yourself  -  how  is  that  possible?   How  come that people who are
regarded  as  'people  who  are themselves' are admired?  When we try to be
'ourselves',  we  hate it.  We hate the little fool that is the real person
inside  us.   It  is  much  better  to  conform again, try to find out what
other  people  think is a great person and live by their rules.  That fails
too, we feel like clowns who participate in a show. We cannot play the role
as we want to, and in the end we believe that we look like complete idiots.
We go home and wonder how to play the role better.  We watch movies to find
out, we  write  stories  to  create perfect persons and we drink alcohol to
relax  and  forget.   We  admire the one who we believe is him- or herself,
simply because they have something we believe that we have not.
  We  are  victims of the majority, we are a part of the majority, hence we
are  victims  of  ourselves.   Sooner  or later we die, and perhaps we have
succeeded  in  the  task  of  soften  our  own  pain.  We live and die like
dreamers.   Those  who  we  regard  as successful people do not fancy their
situation more than we do.  No one ever reach  the  complete  satisfaction.
  We  need  the  escape  macabre.   It  does not matter if we are young and
foolish  or grown  and mature.  If it was not available we would fade away,
like shadows in the evening.  The escape macabre is our own personal dawn.
