                            Swedish Moose Surprise
                                   by Knyttet

  They were just like typical tourists in Sweden. They came from Germany by
car. They hadn't really bothered to learn anything about swedish traffic
regulations. And why should they, they were GERMANS. When all the swedes
drove about in 110 km/hour, just like all law obeying swedes do, the German
car passed them with a speed of about 250 km/hour. But the swedes weren't
really bothered, at least this one didn't have a caravan behind it. That
was quite common too, by the way, that a car with German plates passed with
that speed AND with a caravan attached to it. Of course there were some old
men with caps out there who became upset about the speeding car, but who
listens to old people nowadays, and especially if they wear caps.

  So with this speed the germans passed through the landscape of Sweden. They
were eager to see as much as possible, and this was the same thing as going
as far as possible. I can't understand what you can see at 250 km/hour, but
I guess the germans do.

  The day passed by and the night came. What the germans didn't know, and what
all swedes know, is that at this time of the year, is when all the moose start
to move around. I guess it wouldn't really matter if they had known what hit
them. Now death came immediately, so I guess they didn't care what the
grey/brown big mass that crashed into their car was.
