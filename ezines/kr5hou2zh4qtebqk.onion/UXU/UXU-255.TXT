 It was quiet. The two men were sitting on each end of an old wooden table.
 Brown and black circles and stains from all the cups of coffee that had been
 served there for ages, almost covered it's surface.

 They hadn't seen each other for more than seventy years, but none of them had
 any problems recognizing each other. Both men knew very well what was going
 to happen, and why. They were here last time doing the same thing, but this
 would be their final reunion.

 The man in the black shirt took a peek at his watch. "Five minutes left, old
 friend" he said in a low voice and sighed gently. The other man looked at
 his friend's time teller and responded with a nod.

 It didn't seem like there were sixty seconds in a minute anymore. Time
 seemed to go faster and faster. Two minutes. They both left their half-
 emptied cups on the table and went outside. "It's too cloudy!" one said.
 "We'll never make it this time!" cried the other.

 Now they were standing shoulder to shoulder, staring at the cloudy and pitch
 black sky. Their knees were slightly shaking of excitement. No visible stars
 anywhere. "It should be here any second now!" one of them yelled.
   As the almost invisible spot on the sky moved from one end of the horizon
 to the other, they followed it with their eyes, with their mouths open. Then
 it was gone. "That big chunk of ice just gets better and better." "Yes, last
 time it wasn't quite as bright as today. I'm satisfied." "So am I." The two
 last members of the Halley Club went back into the house and finished their
 coffee.
