              "Winning isn't everything - it's the only thing."



  Dear readers! In this file you will find five *easy* questions related
  to the files of the Underground eXperts United magazine. Answer all of
  them, and you may be one of the lucky *three* who will receive a cool'n
  hip *CD-ROM DISC* filled to the limit with excellent t-files!

  More precisely, this is what you can win...

     1st Place - "The Black Philes II" CD-ROM! The second and latest CD
                 in the Underground "Philes" series, containing over 14.500
                 new files. Released 1996 by Synchron Data. Color: Black.

                 one was released 1995 by Synchron Data. Color: Blue.

     3rd Place - "The X-Philes" CD-ROM! No, it's not the same as the
                 2nd place - this one is not in the underground series,
                 even though it does contain a bit of such files anyway.
                 Over 21.000 files on this one too. Released 1995 by
                 Synchron Data. Color: Green.

   Right, now let's get down to the simple questions...

  -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

        * QUESTION NUMBER ONE.
        In which file did a man clone himself into several copies?

        * QUESTION NUMBER TWO.
        Which two files has the same name, but different authors?

        * QUESTION NUMBER THREE.

  -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-



  That's it! Send the correct answers to:  <gnn@update.uu.se>

  If you're not connected to the net, feel free to try snail mail:
  uXu, c/o Svensson, Kantorsgatan 4:415, 754 24 Uppsala, SWEDEN.
  A postcard will do just fine.

  Do not forget to include your snail mail address, because there is
  still no DCC SEND CD-ROM available, or equal, catch my drift?
  (No, it is not possible to uuencode things made of plastic either.)

  Three winners will be drawn, and notified about their success *fifteen
  days* after the release of this file. (To know which date this file
  was released, check out uXu Index #24.) The lucky ones will be
  presented by handle or just by country/state (we noticed that some
  people wanted to remain anonymous when we had our first compo) in
  the next index (#25) file. Good Luck!


              "If at first you don't succeed, try, try again.
              Then quit. No use being a damn fool about it."
