    Inner Demons


    I can see your body,
    I can touch it.

    I can hear your voice. But still,
    you ain't here.

    It's like there are demons where your brain used to be.
    And you see them clearly.

    To me they are the screams and those silly sentences
    that you make, but I understand that for you they are real.

    I feel so powerless, seeing this human that I used to love,
    that I still love, eaten up from inside, ghosts in her mind.

    What can I do?
    How will I stand it?

    I'm not sure you know what has happened,
    and let's hope not.

    But still, I can see the pain these demons are causing you.
    And I can hear it, in your screams.

    Sometimes you scare me. You look at me as you can see my future.
    You give me that look of insanity, and I don't know what to say or to do.

    Sometimes you scream and then you turn to me and ask,
    "Why honey, Why?"

    It gives me the creeps, it gives me nightmares,
    it makes it more difficult to come and see you.

    I don't have as much to do as I keep telling myself.
    In fact, I would have time to come and visit you more often.
    But I don't.

    You scare me, your pain scare me.
    My bad conscience makes it harder every time to visit you.

    It's like a bad circle. I'm not sure that it's your demons that scare me
    the most. Maybe it's my own.

    Maybe I look at you and see my own future, is this it?
    Is this the way I'm gonna be when I'm old?

    I told you about the nightmares? Sometimes you are in them, screaming
    for me to come and help you, to rescue you. Like you do sometimes when
    we talk on the phone.

    But mostly I see myself in the dreams. Stuck in a wheelchair,
    unable to move, and all over me these demons are crawling.

    In and out of my ears, and out of my mouth, I can't even scream,
    they are blocking my throat.

    I guess you feel this sometimes, because I can see in your eyes that you
    need to say something, need to scream, but you can't.

    Because they are everywhere.
