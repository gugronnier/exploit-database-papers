         [  What Is?  ]                            [  By Phearless  ]

     What is?


 You think you have seen everything, but you have seen nothing.

     You know much, but not all there is to learn.
 
 You think you have found everything, but you have only found something.

     You have found much, but not all there is to be found.

 You say you know; know you are just a part of everything, but I can

 see in your eyes that you think you are everything yourself.

     You have become blind.  You used to be wise.

 Never stop asking yourself questions.

 Questions are nothing to be afraid of. Questions cannot be evil.



 Your biggest fault is that you have stopped searching.

 You will not admit it, but you truly have.

 If you quit looking for more, you will find no more.

 You are betraying yourself, if you believe you need no more.

 By thinking you have found the right and only true thing in

 your life, you are closing more doors than you have ever opened.

 Your once so open mind will be shut.

 The explanation to why your days seem so bright now, is that your

 world has become so small that even the smallest candle is shining

 like the sun to you.

 It is wise to see the great things in the unimportant, but also to

 see the falsehood of the great.


 A lie is always a lie, no matter how many people believe in it.

 A theory is never more than just a theory. Nevertheless it is

 not an excuse to reject or condemn neither of them.

 In every lie there is a truth. In every truth there is a lie.

 Never forget that every piece is part of something greater.


 There are things that cannot be understood, explained nor

 explored by man. That fact however does not give anyone the

 right to claim a theory as the one and only truth.

 If you lack the ability to doubt, do not expect others to take

 what you say seriously.

 Doubting is your mind's way of showing it is still in order.


 It is not necessary to see nor touch something to be able to

 believe in it. Sometimes you just feel when it is right.

 Just always remember that you might not be feeling what is

 wrong and what is right.

 A feeling is never more than just a feeling, no matter how

 strong or how intense it might become.

 Trust in one's feelings could be just as bad, or good, as any

 other kind of impression.


 Look and feel with your mind opened, do not let happiness nor

 sadness blur your vision.

 You are a product of all you have learned and experienced, do

 not try to change what you are just for the sake of changing.

 Every new day of wishing you could change will only make you lose

 pieces of yourself until there is very little left of what you

 once were.


 See. Hear. Smell. Taste. Feel. But always carry your knowledge

 and wisdom with you. Without them, your senses are no more than

 tools in the hands of a fool.

If you eliminate every possible logical explanation to a problem, the
illogical, however unlikely, is inevitable true.
