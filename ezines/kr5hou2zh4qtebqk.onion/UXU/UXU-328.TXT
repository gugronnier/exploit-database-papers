                      [A man in need]


And  as I looked up I could see how it all was supposed  to
be.  How  it  was  formed and shaped.  It  was  all  there.
Everything had been taken care of. Except for the humans.


                       Starting out

The first time I saw her was at the local store a couple of
blocks from my house. I was stunned, I realized immediately
that  she  was  something special. Not like them  whores  I
usually  met  at the pub or in some shabby disco.  She  was
really  something. Her hair was sort of brownish and barely
reached  down to her neck. She moved with grace and  looked
right  at me. Our eyes met and I blushed. I guess I thought
that she,  in some strange way,  knew what I was  imagining
about  her.  She  walked  past  me  and  paid her  milk  at
the counter.  She  didn't  look  back  when  she  left  the
store.  I strolled around the store for  about  2-3 minutes
and  then  went  out after her. She was about  two  hundred
meters away from me when I got out. Her hair floated in the
wind.  It  was a warm day and I felt very good. I  imagined
that  I  ran  up  to  her and asked  her  who  she  was  or
something. That wouldn't work. It never did. My personality
and  my body is strongly repellent to women. No, this  time
there  would  be no picking up or trying to  confront  her.
This  time  I was the one in charge. This time  I  was  not
going to be let down. She kept on walking and walking.
I  think  we  walked  three or four kilometers  before  she
stopped outside a house. She did not turn back once  as  we
walked. She had no idea that I was following her. It was  a
small  house  with  three floors. Perhaps  there  could  be
around twelve apartments in there. I went over to the other
side  of the street to see what floor she lived on. It took
a while but after five minutes the lights went on and I saw
her  in  what  must have been her kitchen. I was  satisfied
when I started to walk home.


                       Getting ready

Now  what? I thought to myself. Damn it man, you never  get
anything  done!  It was 2 a.m. in the morning and  my  head
was  spinning with ideas as to what I should do  next.  She
had  probably  never even noticed me when I  met  her  that
afternoon.  I  poured another drink of whiskey  and  lit  a
cigarette. She was not all that beautiful either. But  with
this  one there was something different. My hands began  to
shake as I got more and more angry. I am never going to  be
able  to  confront her or anything. I'm just going  to  sit
here  and  get more and more drunk. I stood up and  put  my
coat on. I put the bottle in my coat and walked out. It had
been  a  long walk back from her apartment this  afternoon.
But man! Going back there was even longer. Could be that  I
also was heavily  drunk  perhaps.  The whole house was dark
when I arrived. I just stood there like an idiot.  Watching
her window. Hoping that she would show herself. I walked in
to  the  stairwell  and went up the  three  floors  to  her
apartment. On the door was a small sign saying `here  lives
Jessica  Tibblin and Rufus'. Rufus must be a dog I  thought
in  my blurred brain. No one names a child Rufus. Naahh, it
is  a dog all right. From inside I could even hear it growl
and  chew  on something. Perhaps it was chewing on  her.  I
walked down and out on the street. It was now about 3  a.m.
in  the  morning and I was feeling very tired. I went  home
and got to bed.
When  I  woke up I had a terrible hangover, but through the
fog  in  my  brain I remembered that her name  was  Jessica
Tibblin and that she had a dog. I was on summer vacation so
I  did not have anything special to do. I decided there and
then  that  this  was to be  my project for  the  summer  -
getting her. Nothing else mattered. Never since have I felt
such  a strong devotion to a project. I spent the following
two  weeks  planning it. When I was done I had the  perfect
plan.  Not  much could go wrong. And even if it did, I  had
several backup plans memorized. All that was left was to do
it.


                         Surprise!

First of all I had to watch her for a couple of days to get
to  know  her habits.  I found a really good place opposite
her house,  to watch her from. It was about the most boring
thing  I had ever done.  She went up at around 7 a.m., made
herself some coffee, showered and went to work. At  5  p.m.
she  came  back  with  a  bag or something.  Probably  with
groceries in it. When I saw her come out around 10 p.m. one
night I was surprised. But most of all, I was pleased.  She
was  not  fat or anything. But she probably liked  to  walk
around in  the evenings. Her life must be quite  boring,  I
thought  to myself. She walked around for some time  and  I
followed her at a safe distance. I was somewhat puzzled  by
the fact that she did not have the dog with her though.
It  was hot and her pace was kind of fast, so she took  her
sweater off. Beneath it she had a tight T-shirt that showed
almost  everything.  My body went berserk,  my mind too,  I
must say.  To  the right there was a small park with bushes
and birds  and  all that shit. Luckily she walked in there.
I moved faster and came closer to her. I  could  smell  her
scent. I put my mask on. We must have been in the middle of
the  park when I got hold of her and dragged her into  some
bushes. It was all quiet and the park was empty, except for
some birds. She tried to scream but I held my hand over her
mouth and was quick to get some tape over it. All that came
out  of her were silent growling noises. No one would  hear
her. I laid her down on the ground and started to undo  her
pants.  She tried to kick me and fought around a  lot  with
her  arms. I banged her head once or twice to shut her  up.
It  worked.  My adrenaline was pumping and I felt  my  ears
getting  warm.  I  took my dick out and showed  it  to  her
before  I  put on a condom.  Her eyes widened.  I may be  a
rapist but I am not stupid.
I  took her pants off and put it in her. It was all over in
around four  or five minutes. I got dressed and showed  her
where her pants were. I also left her a letter that  I  had
written to her the other night.

"Dear Jessica,

I  am  so sorry that I had to put you through this. I am  a
very lonely and desperate man. I know that whatever I write
in  this  letter  will  never  make your pain less hard  to
deal with. I will never bother you again. I just wanted you
to know, for whatever it is worth, that I am truly sorry!


Kind regards

Marty

Ps  I  am  not stupid so do not bother looking for  DNA  or
fingerprints on this letter. Ds "

I could not give her my real name  so I had to come up with
some  kind of  handle.  I got the name  Marty from a friend
I used to have some years ago. When I left her I felt great
satisfaction.


                           Guilt

When  I  woke up the next day I could hardly manage to  get
up.  I turned on the radio and heard about a woman who  had
been raped last night.  It was a major  news-story  because
the perpetrator had left a note by the victim.  It was even
on  the  TV.  They had  named me  The Gentle Rapist.  I had
enormous feelings of guilt as I  heard her  statement  from
the  hospital.  For a while I thought  about  sending  some
flowers  or  something.  But  that  would  only  be stupid.
Though,  I think it was a nice idea.  I  finally got out of
bed and got dressed. It was a pity that I had rushed things
this much. It was stupid and dangerous. Now I had to keep a
really low profile  for  a  couple  of  weeks.  Not showing
myself much in the city. And most of all,  avoiding  police
cars and police officers as much as I could. That would not
be a problem I thought.  School was out and I could  do  my
shopping in another part of the town.
I  walked by Jessica's house a week later. Perhaps  it  was
not such a good idea, but I had to see her once more. I saw
her  standing in the kitchen with a robe on. Obviously  she
had  called in sick. It looked as if though she was crying.
I  felt really low the next couple of days and then decided
to get over it.


              Another and another and another

As  time went by,  I felt more and more  frustrated.  I had
dreams about Jessica and could not get rid of them.  I even
started to hear voices. They never said much. Mostly it was
just `ehrm,  naughty boy!'  or  `you shouldn't have done it
man!'. Sometimes  the  voices  got  nasty  though  and said
things  like  `Hey man, fuck her',  `fuck her!,  fuck her!,
fuck her!,  fuck her in the ass man!'.  I knew that I could
never  go  anywhere near  her  but  I  had to do something.
Otherwise I  would definitely  lose my mind - if it was not
lost already  that is.
My search for another woman began. I spent a lot of time on
the  beach  watching possible victims. I knew  what  I  was
doing  all  the  time and I always knew there  was  a  good
chance I would get caught. That did not seem to matter much
though. I had to get another woman, no matter what.
One  day  I  stayed  a bit longer on the beach.  It  became
darker  and darker and most people packed up and went home.
I stayed at the  usual site. I was too lazy to move after a
whole day in the sun. After two hours there was only me and
two  other  girls left on the beach. I packed up my  things
and  moved farther away from them. I did not want  them  or
anyone else to notice me. Most of all I did not want anyone
to  remember  or  recognize me. They started  to  drink.  I
waited  patiently  for my chance. They got  more  and  more
drunk and they laughed and giggled a lot. Then one of  them
apparently decided to go for a swim. That is a very  stupid
thing to do when drunk. But I sure as hell was not going to
stop  her. That only made things easier for me. As she  got
in  the  water I pulled out my mask and made  sure  all  my
things  were packed and ready to go. She was a good swimmer
although she was drunk, she swam around a small island  and
I lost sight of her. I decided this was my chance. I put my
mask  on and ran up to the other girl who was more or  less
dozing  of.  She was really terrified when I put  the  tape
over  her  mouth and started to drag her into  some  nearby
bushes.  I  tied up her arms really tight. She only  had  a
bathing suit  so I got her naked in no-time.  I  introduced
myself  as  Marty and told her to shut up or I  would  kill
her.  That did not work so I had to bang her head a  couple
of  times  before  she got quiet. I put my  condom  on  and
started  to  fuck her. And boy was this a tight  woman!  It
didn't  take me more than a couple of minutes to finish  my
intercourse with her. I left her another of my letters as I
said goodbye and ran off.

"Dear -Insert your name here-,

When  I first saw you I could not believe my eyes. You were
so  beautiful I could hardly believe it. I am a very lonely
and desperate man and I knew I was never going to make love
to  you. The reason I raped you is not because I want to be
evil  to women or anything. It is just that I never get  to
sleep with anyone.  I know that it is really  not an excuse
for my very  rude and bad behavior.  But I hope perhaps you
can  understand  why.  Please  feel safe that I will  never
touch you  or  even come near you again.  Once again, I  am
truly sorry that I had to put you through this!

Kind regards

Marty

Ps  I  am  not stupid so do not bother looking for  DNA  or
fingerprints on this letter. Ds "

As I ran off I could hear her friend shouting and crying as
she  found  her. That did not matter to me at  all.  I  was
completely  cold.  That did not surprise  me  much  though.
Because I had  already  stepped  over  the line and I  knew
there  was  no  turning back. There was no reason  to  have
feelings of guilt or second thoughts. That would only  make
me feel bad.

I  think  I  must  have raped about  10  to  15  women  the
following   months.  Once  I  barely   escaped   when   two
police officers heard the silent  sounds  from  a  woman  I
was raping.  I probably ran about  5  kilometers  before  I
stopped. I was really afraid and lurked in some bushes  for
two  hours before I dared to go home. I left my letters  to
every  single one of the women. Except for the one  that  I
didn't finish with. I made big news with my serial-raping.
Experts  from  all  over the country  gathered  to  make  a
psychological profile of me. They found out that I  was  in
my  late  thirties and that I probably had had  a  terrible
youth. A small dick and an IQ below 90. They could not have
been  further from the truth. I was 19 years  old  and  was
still  in school. My IQ was about 120-130 and my dick about
20  centimeters.  Probably bigger  than  anyone's  in  that
fucking expert-group.


        It's getting warm in here don't you think?

Media decided to focus on me. I believe that they must have
had  around ten news reports and talk shows about me. I was
flattered but also very, very scared. What had started  out
as  a way for me to get rid of some of my  frustration  had
now  turned in to a media circus. I decided to give them  a
little something to chew on. "Svart eller Vitt" (talk show)
seemed  to be a good place to start out with so  I  sent  a
long  letter to them explaining why I was doing it. I could
not  help  myself,  so I  wrote  a lot  of  crap  about  my
"political"  motives.  I explained  to  them  that  if  the
Swedish  government did not release a dozen  of  the  worst
criminals,  I  had to go on  raping women.  Of course I was
just pulling their leg, but there was a huge debate whether
they should do it or not. That gave them something to think
about  for  a while. I tried to calm down and  kept  a  low
profile for a couple of weeks. After five weeks the  police
and  media was wondering if I perhaps had fled the  country
or if I was dead. I was not.

That, they noticed on the 14th of August.

During my "sleeping" period I suppressed a lot of feelings.
I felt insecure and was always looking behind myself to see
if someone was following me.  In the  beginning of August I
was in very bad shape and was basically very angry all  the
time.  I  could  not  sleep  and  I  had  terrible  nervous
shakings. School had begun but I did not dare to  go  there
because  I was afraid someone would recognize me. My  anger
focused more and more on the people around me. Then, on the
12th  of August  I bought a sniper-rifle and a Glock 17  on
the  black market. It was not cheap and it  all  felt  very
weird.  The  rifle  I  got was a fine  piece  of  art  with
silencer  and  laser aiming. It had beautiful magnification
and  I  could get a very clear view of just about  anything
that  moved within a two-hundred meter range.  Somewhere in
the back of my mind I knew what was about to  happen  but I
did not care. My paranoia got worse. I could no longer walk
downtown  or  go  to  a  shop. I had to  get  my  groceries
delivered  to my door. I did not dare  to  look  anyone  in
the eyes.  It  became clear to me that there was  only  one
thing left to do. That last thing had to be one hell  of  a
nasty  deed. It was time for me to leave. This time with  a
bang and not with the tail between my legs running off into
the bushes.


                      14th of August

When I woke up that day I was sure. This was the day.
I  cleaned and loaded my weapons. I made sure I had  enough
ammunition for a day or two in the city. I had some serious
hunting to do now. I put my rifle in a bag and my Glock  17
in a holster under my arm. I put my jacket on and went out.
No one noticed me. No one cared and it all felt so calm.  I
walked  around in the city for a while watching the  people
with  a  new sense of awareness. These were the people  who
had  drived me crazy. They were the ones guilty of what was
considered to be my crimes.  Well,  this time  you will all
have  to pay,  I thought to myself.
Almost  in  the  center of the city  lies  a  tall   office
building which houses just about  everything from insurance
companies  to dentists. I went in and took the  elevator to
the  top floor. Of course they had locked the door  to  the
roof, so I had to kick it open before I could get out.
As  I laid down on the roof, my hands stopped shaking. Down
there,  people were walking about in the most happy way you
could imagine. They did not know what was coming. With  the
first shot I got a middle aged man. He was probably waiting
for his bus or something harmless like that. He deserved it
though.  The second bullet hit a ten year old girl  in  the
middle   of  the  forehead.   Her  head  exploded  like   a
watermelon.  Her  mummy went berserk  and  started  to  run
around  screaming  like crazy. I got  her  with  the  third
bullet.  Now  people started to notice that  something  was
seriously wrong. It was OK if one person lied down all of a
sudden  and did not move. But if three persons lay down  in
the same time,  in the middle of the city,  people  tend to
get kind  of nervous. A lot of people started to run around
making  funny  sounds and looking weird. I  must  have  got
around  six or seven people with my rifle when I heard  the
sirens.
I  quickly reloaded my rifle and put it back in my bag.  It
always  took the police too long to figure anything out  so
why  would  they succeed this time, I thought to myself.  I
left the roof and started to make my way down.


                        Burger King

As I got out of the building the police actually noticed me
and yelled at me to stop. I gave them the finger and turned
around  the corner. Not far from the office building  there
was a  Burger King restaurant.  I got my  Glock out and ran
in.  If you are going to take a hostage -  do it in a place
where there  is plenty of food.  People  more  or less went
berserk when they saw me.

   'It is alright!, I am a police officer!'

Most  people  settled down and stopped screaming.  Bham.  I
shot  a  waitress just to surprise them. I jumped over  the
counter  and  told everyone to stay calm, and to get  me  a
Whopper, or  they  would end up like that waitress.  It  is
really  amazing  how  fast  they can  make  Whoppers  under
gun threat!
I  managed  to  get  five people to stay  with  me  in  the
kitchen.  They  were  scared shitless  and  they  were  all
shaking  like hell. One of the girls fainted when I  showed
her  my gun up close. I laughed at her and told one of  the
boys  to get her undressed. He refused. I shot him  in  the
knee.  After that he was very cooperative - until he  dried
up, that is. So, there I was with two boys and three girls,
one of them naked. She had great tits. Police cars drove up
in  front  of the restaurant with their sirens  hurting  my
ears.  A  S.W.A.T  team arrived and tried to  organize  the
liberating of the hostages and the killing of me. After ten
minutes, the phone began to ring. I picked it up.

   'Burger King, what can I do for you sir?'

   'Ehrm, ehhr, are you one of the hostages?'

   'Hostage? No can't say I am sir!'

   'Oh dear.'

   'Although  I  have  heard  a  lot  of  sounds  from  the
restaurant behind your back sir!'

   'Shit.'

He hung up. I almost laughed my jaws out when I saw all the
police officers turning 180 degrees  starting  to shout and
aiming their guns at the other restaurant. The S.W.A.T team
immediately  reconfigured their  plan  and  diverted  their
snipers to the other restaurant. This was a perfect time to
get  rid  of the naked girl. I wrote a large note  which  I
taped  onto  her  tits saying `Just kidding  -  I'm  having
Whoppers  now!'. I poured some cold water on her  face  and
told  her there was a fire and that she had to get  out  as
quickly  as  possible. She did not look around or  question
anything.  She  just  ran out butt-naked  screaming  `fire,
fire!'.  They had to do another 180 degree turn. This  time
they looked as if they were very serious.
The phone started to ring again.

   'Hostages 'R Us, what can I do for you sir?'

   'Yeah, yeah, really funny.'

   'You won't catch me alive you know.'

   'We don't care.'

They  said that they would give me ten minutes to surrender
or  they would come in. No negotiations here. But I had  no
thoughts about  surrendering.  They would not get me alive,
and  put  me  in  some  nut house.  I  took  out one of the
officers with a well-aimed shot in the stomach. The S.W.A.T
team panicked and started shooting at me.  All the  windows
collapsed as they poured lead into the restaurant. The cash
registers got blown away, creating an unbearable noise, but
they did not hit anyone of us  behind the counter,  though.
Fucking amateurs.
From  outside I could hear a loud voice declaring that if I
did  not  come out within the next five minutes they  would
shoot tear gas into the place and move in.

So this is it, I thought to myself as I reloaded my Glock.


                          Payback

A  deafening  fanfare almost cracked my ears  and  a  thick
white  fog  swept in. I thought that they had used the tear
gas but  that  was not it - this  was  something far worse.
I  could hardly believe my eyes when I saw the man standing
in  front of the counter, completely  surrounded  by  white
fog.  This had to be some hell of a  S.W.A.T  team  if they
were so good that  they only had to send in  one man to get
me.  But this man was not from the  S.W.A.T  team, at least
not an earthly one.  He  lifted his hand  to greet me and I
automatically aimed my gun at him. His face showed no signs
of surprise when he saw the barrel of my gun pointing right
at him. He simply looked at it as one looks at  a  harmless
puppy showing its teeth. I looked him in the eyes and asked
him what the fuck was going on.

   'My son, you have wronged. Please do the right thing now
and  I  will lead you to the gates of hell where  you  will
repent  for  a  couple of years. We have been watching  you
from up there and we all know that deep down you are a good
soul. So please come with me and things will work out  just
fine.'

   'So... you are Jesus incarnated huh? Well you'll have to
do more than  to throw a  smoke grenade  to convince me  of
that.  And about  that good soul crap; that's bullshit! I'm
evil as hell and I love it.'

His eyes darkened  when I questioned his  authenticity.  He
reached for something in his robe. Before he could  get  it
out I screamed at him to stop. 'How do I know that's not  a
gun?' 'Well my son, you will just have to trust  me on this
one'. I  lowered  my  Glock  and  nodded,  telling  him  to
proceed. When he got the object out, I was stunned.  It was
a small model  of  the  earth.  It almost glowed and looked
more real than the photos I had seen from the shuttles.  He
held it up to me and told me  to get a good look. I  jumped
over  the counter  and  walked  up to him. The small  model
actually looked as if someone had taken earth and shrunk it
to the size of a grape.

   'OK, you are one hell of a model-builder.  But what's so
great with this one?'

   'Observe!'

He focused his eyes on the continent of Europe. It began to
grow. After a while the model was still the size of a grape
but  it  was  all filled with Europe. One could  see  small
cities  and  small tiny dots of people running around  down
there.  He focused on Sweden and then Uppsala. I could  see
the whole city. Full with life and police cars of course.

   'Now my son, pick one of the police officers out there.'

   'Sure, take that sniper on the roof.'

   'Look, as I now remove him from the face of the earth.'

He  moved  his  fingers  over  the  model.   First  nothing
happened. Then he slowly started to  dissolve  in  a  funny
way. After five seconds he was gone.

   'Man!, that was awesome! You really are Jesus.'

   'Yes, and I want you to follow me now.'

   'I can't do that you know. Mankind has treated me so bad
and I  really have no  choice  but to try  to get even with
some of them.  They have followed me all my life. Nothing I
have done could change that. There's always been school and
a lot of unnecessary shit they have told me to do.  Just to
keep me busy and to keep my mind  away from these  thoughts
of freedom.'

   'But you still have your  free will  you know. You can't
blame these people for being ignorant and stupid.  Besides,
I  really can't  believe  that  all  of  these  people  are
stupid.'

   'Well, maybe you haven't watched all that carefully from
upstairs  but  this  is  the  way  things  actually happen.
All over the western world people are slowly  becoming more
and more like zombies.   I never wanted to have anything to
do with them.  I told the people 'in charge' lots of times,
but no one cares.  I just want to leave  this shit and grow
my  plants  and  write  poems to  beautiful women.  I never
wanted  to  do anyone  any harm.  Can't you see it man?  My
crimes are fucking symptoms of a social disease!'

Jesus went silent for a couple of seconds.

   'Indeed, very good arguments,' he suddenly said.  'Let's
go get them all.'

Jesus jumped over the counter and told me to get back there
with him. I was kind of surprised by the way he was acting.
But,  what the hell! I have always had a way with words.  I
tried  to give him my rifle but he would not accept it.  He
just  smiled a hellish grin at me. Pointed his  finger  out
the  window  and started blasting away all the fuckers  out
there.  It did not take long for us to remove every  living
soul within a 200 meter radius.


                       Hey, Bonsai!

When  we  were done he looked at me and smiled. He told  me
that he had not had this much fun in a thousand years.

   'So, my son. How can I help you now?'

   'Please give me a  life Jesus.  It would be most kind of
you if you set me up in perhaps Japan or something and give
me some peace.'

   'So be it!'

He  snapped  his  fingers. The surroundings  more  or  less
melted  down and it all went black. When I woke  up  I  was
lying in a small bed with a really beautiful Japanese woman
standing over me. She asked me in bad English how  I  liked
my  Tea.  There was not much that could surprise me anymore
so  I  told her I wanted it "black". I stood up and  looked
around.  It was a small house but it was nice. In front  of
me  stood two beautiful bonsai-trees. I looked out  through
the small window. A huge mountain rose a few miles from  my
house. I recognized it as the Fuji mountain. I heard what I
supposed to be my woman talking to me from the kitchen.

   'Darling,  when are you  going to work  on your  bonsai-
trees?'

   'I'll start right after Tea dear!'

Calmness.
