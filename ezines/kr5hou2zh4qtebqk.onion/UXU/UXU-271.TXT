                                      or
                  A Swede's Narrow View On American Politics

  A six year old girl has become a symbol for the raving madness of the
United States of America. Elisa Izquierdo had no chance. After being tortured
for months, she was killed by her own mother, a colored woman with drug
problems and all the problems you can think of at the bottom of the american
society. The surrounding noticed what was happening, but never intervened.
The stories the witnesses and forensic medicine doctors tell has even made
the toughest people shiver. It's okay that vegetable merchants get shot for
petty cash for crack and heroin. It's okay that subway ticket booths are set
on fire, including those inside. But when someone torment the life out of a
six year old? Please. No more.

  While New York shops for christmas in a state of agony over the pictures
of Elisa, Washington argues over the federal budget. President Clinton is
trying to save what can be saved from welfare programs out of reach for the
republicans' crusade. Newt Gingrich and Bob Dole want to balance the budget
for seven years and at the same time, lower the taxes with 245 billion
dollars. People like Elisa and her mother are squeezed tighter and tighter
in order to get the strong and well-educated more money to spend. "The
republican revolution" is more than a cliche. Newt Gingrich's "Contract
with America" is more than an empty threat.

  The majority that took over congress 1994, are now about to dissolve the
last piece of America's social net. A worried and disappointed middle-class
is supposed to point their anger down, towards the junkies, the unemployed,
the criminals, the single teenage mothers, the immigrants and other parasites,
while the republicans disarm the federal power. It's negativism and contempt
for politicians raised to politics. A sure way of tearing down an already
nervous society even more. The Gallup-president Clinton has been forced to
go along - he promises unnecessary tax reductions of 105 billion dollars
himself - but still appear as a liberal angel compared to the opposition on
the right wing.

  The United States of America has developed in two phases. First, 150 years
of wild individualism, then six decades of attempting to form a fellowship,
with milestones like "New deal" and "Great society". Newt wants the Wild West-
phase back, and has come far in only a year. Freedom for the capital,
discipline for the individual and everyone for himself. The social net has
turned into a hammock, he thinks. Poverty and crime can be traced to poor
social economics and too mild sentences. The single, sick and poor are to
blame for the fact that America goes to hell!

  What the republicans are trying to do, is a replay of the 1981 tax-
reductions, only this time marketed with Gingrich's cold grin instead of
Reagan's warm smile. Reaganomics was a con-trick back then, and it still
is. If you lower the taxes and leave the military alone at the same time,
there's no way you can balance the budget without painful cuts in other
areas. And because the individual interests usually manage to defend
themselves, it's the future and the social contract that is going to be
cashed in. More and more people will start and end their lives like Elisa
Izquierdo. The shrinking middle-class will have a tougher time isolating
themselves from violence and misery. Finally, the holy economy will suffer
the effects as well.

  The previous governor of New York, Mario Cuomo, described what the
republicans are up to with the United States of America in a bitter book.
It's not a pretty picture of the future, but the ex-governor concludes,
rightfully, that people like him are always safe. "I can move away from
the violence. The hospital care will always be there when I need it.
The fish and the woods will live long enough to satisfy me. Those who
wrote Contract with America tempt us fortunate ones with the luxury of
individualism and indifference, so why not surrender? Why not? Honestly,
because I see their invitation as an insult. How dare they strike at our
fear and frustration? How dare they think so low of us?"

  Anyone expressing himself in such a way doesn't stand a chance and gets
a label saying "extremist" in the United States of America today. The
welfare society is rated as low as the politicians are, but sooner or
later the wind will change. Cuomo for president.
