                        FUCK YOU, STEFAN KRONQVIST
                      by THE GNN/DualCrew-Shining/uXu




               A short tribute to Sweden's Public Idiot #1.


  Recently,  Mr  Stefan  Kronqvist  told  one of the largest news papers in
Sweden  that  'In  every BBS you will find children pornography.  Where you
find children pornography, you will find drugs and weapons.'
  With  those  words,  Mr  Kronqvist  exposed  his  gigantic  hate  against
computers  and  the  computer culture.  Who is this man?  Why do he keep on
destroying  the electronic world, by turning the mob against it?  What does
he  want?   What  Mr  Kronqvist said had nothing to do with his concern for
children nor his macho hunt for terrorists.
  Let me tell you about Mr Kronqvist.

  If  George  Orwell  had  been alive, he had not called the machine in his
epic  1984 'Big Brother', he had called it 'Big Stefan'.  Because the least
you could blame Mr Kronqvist for is that he loves the idea of police states
and  a  total  destruction  of  the  freedom  of  speech.   Compared  to Mr
Kronqvist,  Hitler, Stalin and Caligula looks like harmless infants.  He is
desperate  and  in  constant  agony.   He  cannot stand the fact that other
people  got  access  to  the infobahn and hence are able to know more about
this world than himself.  Beyond the black moustache and the thick glasses,
below  the  grey hair you will find a fanatic hunter that tracks down every
prey he smells and kills it without mercy.

  Why  do Mr Kronqvist behave like this?  We suppose that he has not always
thought  like  this,  so we must find out when his mind snapped.  Kronqvist
works  for  the  police  and  his  specialities  was to catch and prosecute
so-called  hackers  and  other  shockwave  riders.  This is a hard work and
Kronqvist  could  not take the heat.  He had trouble finding suspects which
made his superiors rather annoyed and gave him serious stomach problems.  I
asked one of his colleagues and he admitted that Kronqvist was not the real
man for a job like this.  "The guy got insane after a while, when he failed
to prosecute suspects," the colleague says.  "I have never seen a man bitch
and shout over details for several minutes and then suddenly run off to the
bathroom.  He did this over thirty times per day".
  The problem is that Kronqvist does not know anything about how computers,
networks  and  hackers  work.  He had to rely on illegal methods like phone
tapping  and indiscrete stake outs when he wanted to get somewhere.  It may
be  hard  to  believe, but at this stage Kronqvist was only half way to his
complete  break  down.   Suddenly,  he understood that hackers and computer
wizards  does  not  only  know  how  to  hack.  They know how to know about
everything  around  them.   This  left Kronqvist with fear.  I mean, if you
during  the  search  in  a  suspect's  house  finds  your  own life closely
documented  would not you freak out completely?  Kronqvist did.  Hence, his
hate  against the computer world is too great to be described in words.  Mr
Kronqvist  is a paranoid madman, a mega-lo-maniac and a menace to the human
race.   Unfortunately,  he  works  for  the state and cannot be attacked by
arguments that easy.

  After  Mr  Kronqvist  had  quit  his  job,  cut his hair and reloaded his
handgun  he  wanted  revenge.  He understood that it was not enough to just
catch  a few of the information-thirsty individuals that roared past him on
the  telephone lines.  He had to destroy everything that had to do with the
computer  culture  without mercy.  Since he is still employed by the state,
media trusts him when it comes to information about this subject.  The only
thing  he had to do was to lie.  Lie, lie, lie, exaggerate and show off his
huge  hate,  neatly  dressed  in  calm  words  which gives the population a
feeling of security.  Mr Kronqvist attacks the networks, the bulletin board
systems  and the computer underground on all front lines.  He tells the mob
that  modems  are  the  work of Satan, BBS'S and networks are private clubs
dedicated  to  pedophilia,  fringe  terrorist groups and drug abusers.  His
words  are  spread  across  the country like a fire storm and since the mob
want scandals they believe everything he says.

  What should we do about Stefan Kronqvist?  Should we let this man destroy
the  freedom  of speech, the human right to knowledge and the public access
to the networks and bulletin board systems?  If we declare war with him, we
cannot  fight  by  his  rules.   He is a police man, a man of the corrupted
state,  and  the  only  way  of talking he can is by gun, night stick and a
tight  prison.  However, we are not his personal victims that sit quiet and
swallow  the tears.  Computer networks means power and we still got access.
We  are  still  able.   No one shall stop us from making contact with other
people and break down the borders of the future.
  Spread  the  word.   Do  not  let  him  take over this world because then
nothing will ever be the same.
