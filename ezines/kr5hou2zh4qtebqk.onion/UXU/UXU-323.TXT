        I've  got that feeling again. It's not a very good feeling.
        When I get it, I know things are actually going from bad to
        worse.  When I met her this evening she acted quite  normal
        and  did not behave  in any way  that  led  me  to  suspect
        that  there   was  something  wrong.  Still,   during   our
        conversation  I  could always feel  that she   was  holding
        something back. Something that she really didn't want me to
        know about.
        I  definitely  knew  there  was something  wrong  when  she
        didn't  ask me to call her or anything. I felt disappointed
        and  thought  to myself that she is only doing  what  every
        girl before  her had done;  dumping me.  I  stared  at  her
        for a moment and couldn't draw my eyes from her. I knew she
        was just a girl, one in my own age.   But still,  I thought
        that this one was  different.  Why  couldn't  she  tell  me
        that  she didn't  want me,  when I first  met her?   I felt
        deeply betrayed.
        This time though, there  was  no  easy  way  out.  She  had
        to  pay  for this.   She was going to pay for  all the pain
        that the likes of her had caused me during all these years.
        We  went home to  my place.  As we went in,  I  locked  the
        door and  hid  the  key  under  some  papers  on  a  table.
        I  was  sure now. She was going to dump me. No girl in  her
        right  mind  starts babbling about 'freedom' and 'having to
        spend  some  time  to herself' unless she's  going to  dump
        someone.  I then knew what was going to happen. We sat down
        on  my  couch  and I  asked  her if there was  something  I
        could  get her. "No, I'm fine" she said. Are you just going
        to  sit there and fart in my couch or what? Get on with  it
        you bitch!, I thought. "Well, you know...." she said.  Here
        it comes! "I feel that perhaps we should take some time off
        from our relationship",  she said looking down at my table.
        I sat down and tried to catch her eyes as I started to talk
        to her.  "Damn it! I love you! Why didn't you say something
        about this before? Perhaps we could have worked it out!", I
        said to her in the most calm way possible. She explained to
        me that her love for me had faded. The fire was put out. In
        other words: she had found someone else. I looked her  very
        deep  in  her eyes and asked her if she had  found  someone
        else. "I don't know. Perhaps, sort of, I think...." I could
        live with that. What I couldn't live with was the fact that
        she had obviously been lying to me for a  couple of months.
        That I understood now. The changes in her behavior  and her
        unwillingness to have sex were not something that had  come
        just  some  weeks ago. This had been going on  for  two  or
        three months now. Out of the three and a half years we  had
        been  going out  she had been unfaithful to me for a couple
        of months,  perhaps  only  in  thought,  but  hey!  There's
        really no difference!
        I  just sat there and watched her. She was getting more and
        more  nervous  and uncomfortable as I kept on watching  her
        from  behind the table. Finally, I said  "So... Now  what?"
        She looked at me and asked me if I was stupid or something.
        "Can't  you  get it man? Just leave me alone  and  go  fuck
        someone  else. I don't want you anymore you fucking moron!"
        she screamed at me.

        That did it.

        Her  eyes  widened when I put my hand over  her  mouth  and
        whispered  to her to shut up. I punched her in the  face  a
        couple of  times. She passed out after the  second or third
        blow, I think.  Do  you  think  I'm  stupid?,  I thought to
        myself. No bitch is going to push me around anymore. I went
        to get a rope and other things I knew I would need  for the
        further arrangements. When I came back  with the equipment,
        she was still  unconscious, though now  bleeding  from  her
        nose  and mouth.  I wiped it off  with a towel.  I tied her
        arms and legs together.  This bitch  ain't going nowhere, I
        thought  and smiled  to myself.  She  came around  some ten
        minutes after I had tied her up, and now she looked  really
        scared.  I  cursed  myself  when  I  discovered  that I had
        forgotten to put something in her mouth.  I got an  old rag
        and stuffed it into her mouth. She looked at me with  tears
        in her  eyes  while  making  funny sounds behind the smelly
        rag.  I smiled at her  and said that she  wasn't  going  to
        break any man's heart  again.  She caught on quite fast and
        her eyes was somewhat watered. Perhaps I shouldn't be doing
        this? She didn't mean  any  harm.  Perhaps  she just didn't
        know any  better? What  if she had  only  been thinking out
        loud  and wanted to hear  that  I still  loved her.  In her
        foolishness she had perhaps only said that she thought that
        we needed a break?
        My  thoughts rushed through my brain. Ok, let's give her  a
        second  chance. I removed the rag and asked her if she  was
        ok.  "Ok?  You  fucking hit me in the  face  you  prickless
        bastard! Let me go! I never want to see you again!"
        Just like I thought! No mistake on my side.
        I put the rag back in to her mouth. She tried to scream. It
        didn't  matter,  my neighbors  weren't the kind  who  cared
        about someone screaming. Actually, they  didn't  care about
        anything  except  getting  their  drugs.  Living in a rough
        neighborhood  had  its  advantages.  I got  my lighter  and
        showed it to her. "Hmmm ougghen" she said. Huh?  I took the
        fabric out  and let her speak.  "Nice  lighter,  now let me
        go!"  Apparently she didn't  understand  what  was going to
        happen.  I put the rag back and lit the lighter.  It burned
        with a nice  blue and red glow. I let it burn for  a  while
        before I put it  out.  I pressed it  against her  forehead,
        making  a  little smiling face appear. She went  stiff  and
        made  a  lot  of  unpleasant sounds. I  continued  to  make
        smiling faces on her for a while. After some time she  kind
        of  got used to it and didn't make that much noise anymore.
        I  knew that making smiling faces wouldn't suffice. I  went
        to my kitchen and got the knife that my father gave to me a
        few  hundred years ago. When I got back she had passed out.
        I  noticed  that her pants were wet. I put my fingers  over
        her  cunt  and  smelled  them.  She  had wet herself.  Well
        baby! You have earned it!
        I had to wait for a while before she came around this time.
        I didn't want to throw water at her  or anything.  That's a
        damn cruel thing to do!
        When  she  woke up she stared at me  and cried.  Baby baby!
        What  are you crying about? I'm just going to give you some
        of  your own treatment! I started cutting her shirt of. Her
        beautiful  and  well formed breasts popped  out  as  I  cut
        through her bra. I laid my hand on her stomach and  touched
        her for the last time. Her stomach was never to be the same
        again.  Silky  and smooth  it laid there and waited for  my
        knife to open it up.
        "This won't hurt!", I said,  recalling what my dentist used
        to say. I pressed my knife through her skin. Blood squirted
        out because I had hit  an  artery. I opened her all the way
        up  to  her  neck. Things  came  out of her.  Although  the
        manoeuvre  must have caused a lot of pain she didn't say or
        scream anything. Now she just laid there.

        Looking all casual.
