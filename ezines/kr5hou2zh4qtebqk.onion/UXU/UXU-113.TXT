  This was definitely the hardest album I've ever transcribed, so take it easy
  on the complaints ok? It's not that easy when most of the lyrics are "dream-
  scape" whispers. Hopefully, the rest is pretty much ok. That's about it for
  me. Enjoy the lyrics.



[-*-Spanish Air-*-]

Screams that seem unreal
Shouts [...follower...] sins
There's nothing here for me now
The wind blows for as far as I can see

I long for the sun
There [...in the name...]
For all that I have
There's written in waves
I know that now
There's left to be seen
I know that I've lost him
I'm leaving here

Fastest knife a sign
Feels so far away
There's nothing here for me now
The clouds fly so far
I'm lost there now

I long for the sun
There [...in the name...]
For all that I have
Is written in waves
And now that I [...know...]
Is left to be seen
And now that I've lost him
I'm leaving here



[-*-Celia's Dream-*-]

She flies
She's gone to ride an angel's breath
Gone to taste a dream
And every time I call her
A shadow crawls away

But she takes
She laughs him all [...there is...]
And everything we are [...spring...]

She gives
She told me that she loved me
Loved us for a day
And all the time I feel her
I feel her fade away

But she takes
She gives him all the [...fakes...]
And everything feels good
And clouds like shadows pass
Is passing like the day

She takes
She gives him all the [...shadows...]
And everything feels good
And clouds like shadows pass
Is passing like the day



[-*-Catch The Breeze-*-]

Feels like all the days are gone
Just catch the breeze
[...When nothing had too far...]
Rain, washes, ways down

And I, [...the...to...]
And I, am watching [...him...] too far
You can believe in everything
You can believe it all

Hey, are you feeling something new
Just watch the rain, it helps in all you do
The breeze, it blows, it blows everything

And I, [...the...to...]
And I, [...] the sun to shine
You can believe in everything
You can believe it all



[-*-Ballad Of Sister Sue-*-]

[...You...] tell me I'm lost and I don't seem too sure what to do
[...You...] tell me I'm lost and I don't seem too sure what to do
There's a fire in my head and I'm blinded by bullets
There's a fire in my head and I'm blinded by bullets

[...Can't seem...] to know that I'm losing my head
[...Can't seem...] to know that I'm losing my head
And the man at the bar that [...night...] recall that he needed me
And the man at the bar that [...night...] recall that he needed me

Sister, I've lost all the feeling
I'm lost and I'm sold
I lay down beside you
Sister, I'm blinded
It's only my eyes
I've sold them before

The man said the drinking is handled [...by pouring it right...]
The man said the drinking is handled [...by pouring it right...]
And It seemed much the same when he pointed the gun at his head
And It seemed much the same when he pointed the gun at his head
[...Who'd need me then...]

In raise of much noise and I checked out the time, yeah
Let all my face down because of a stranger

Sister, I've lost all the feeling
I'm lost and I'm sold
I lay down beside you
Sister, I'm blinded
It's only my eyes
I've sold them before



[-*-Erik's Song-*-]

Instrumental



[-*-Waves-*-]

Watch the waves so far away
And washing cross the paths that I have made
Leaving all my sins, I turn away
Like soaring birds I watch my sorrows play

Don't you know, I've left and gone away
You're knocking on the door I closed today
And everything looks brighter
Waves at play just sooth my pain away

Felt so good to see the sun
I choose my time before I choose the wine
Floating cross the waves the silence runs
My thoughts [...endure...] but now my sorrow's done

Don't you know, I've left and gone away
You're knocking on the door I closed today
And everything looks brighter
The waves at play, they sooth my pain away



[-*-Brighter-*-]

She [...]
[...The birth made of grain...]
She can now see the sun
And everyone said then
You're better off dead but
She didn't know we were alone

And when it all looks brighter
Just turn around and smile
When it's looking better
Just leave it all to time
Just leave it all to time

She said don't you [...]
There's people in [...places...]
And [...places...] is what made her see?
And everyone said yeah
She's better off dead but
She looked like she wanted to live

And when it all looks brighter
Just turn around and smile
When it's looking better
Just leave it all to time
Just leave it all to time

When it all looks brighter
Just turn around and smile
And when it's looking better
Just leave it all to time
Just leave it all to time
Just leave it all to time

 
[-*-The Sadman-*-]

I [...]
It all away
It all goes round
The house today

Do reason lie
You're leasing time
There's someone close
Because for you

[...]
The family, [...we want to be...]

The [...things...] you say
The songs that shine
For all the time

I [...]
Your smile [...place...]
There's someone close
Because for you

You hurt my feelings, [...you needed me...]
[...I found by you, the mark for you...]


 
[-*-Primal-*-]

Today
I lost a [...colours fray...]
Watch the games you play
[...] all force down you
Don't forget the days
When the sunshine's fading
Remember what they say
Remember what they say

The right time
She calls
To tell
Every time
She says she's falling
And every time
She calls us friends

Because
To the right time
She calls
To tell [...it would...]
Every time
She says she's falling
Every time
She calls us friends
Can't believe
She says she's [...]
Can't believe
[...Disgusted...]
[...Disgusted...]
Can't believe it
[...]
[...]
[...]
