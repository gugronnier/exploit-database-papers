   He had waited for two weeks for a reply from the Royal House. He had
sent the letter to the Queen because it was the last resort. No court in the
country could ever wash off the mark he had gotten as a child abuser. Not
that he had never touched a kid. He had, but he had never harmed them or
made any sexual invitations. The kids never noticed it that much because
they trusted him as their gym teacher. The fact that he was 'one of them
perverts' was something that he had learned to live with. When he took the
first photos of a naked kid he felt such an enormous relief. The kid did
not see him, neither had anyone else on the beach where he took the
pictures. He developed the photos in his own lab so that the stores
would not call the police. By now there was about a hundred photos of naked
kids in his drawers. He did not want to do the kids any harm. It was just
that his sexual desires were so much stronger than his moral. There was not
much he could do about it. The psychiatrist he had tried to get in touch
with did not want to have anything to do with him.

   When it was obvious that the Royal House would not answer his letter he
decided to end it all. Ever since he had been a teenager he had always been
interested in guns and weapons. Now in his forties he had quite an
impressive collection. He picked out a few pictures of some boys who he had
in his gym class and masturbated. When he was finished, he felt a strange
feeling of calmness. The world around him was getting indistinct and he got
more and more determined. This was it, there was no turning back now. He
grabbed a semi-automatic rifle and a Berretta. He put them in his gym bag
and turned off the lights in his house. On the way out he remembered that
he had forgotten the ammo. He picked it up and left the house. He did not
care about locking the door. There was no meaning in that. In one hour this
place would be swarming with cops, he thought. Any burglar in here by that
time would probably wet his pants.

   When he arrived at the school he was pleased to see that there was a
gym class just starting. It was 8.40 a.m. and it was a perfect day to rip
the city of Dunblane off its virginity. He loaded his rifle and his gun and
walked into the dressing rooms. It was all quiet. From the other side of
the wall he could hear the kids laughing and cheering at each other. In
about ten minutes this place will be cold and dead and you small fuckers
won't laugh anymore, he mumbled to himself. When he opened the door it was
like he had been struck on his head with a bat. The sound of all the kids
screaming and running around felt like knives in his ears. He walked slowly
into the room and put the rifle against his shoulder. Two kids saw him and
started to scream. He aimed at them at pulled the trigger.
   It did not take him more than ten minutes to get rid of all the small
fuckers running around in the room. He walked around and checked all the
bodies. He used the Berretta on those who still seemed to be alive. No
one was alive now. He sat down in the middle of it all and looked around.
There was blood all over. Brains and pieces of children's bones and skulls
were splattered on the walls around him. He felt pleased.

   He knew what had to come next but he just wanted to wait for a while. He
wanted to look at them one last time. He reached out and touched one of the
kids. It was still warm. Only a few minutes ago this body was running around
having the time of its life. That kid never knew anything about the man who
had just shot him.

   He reloaded his Berretta and closed his eyes. So, this is it, he thought.
He opened his mouth and put the gun in it. The barrel was still warm and
hurt his mouth.

   "So long, and thanks for nothing!"

   Blackness.
