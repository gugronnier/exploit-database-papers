Topic: UDP Port Denial-of-Service Attack
- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

The CERT Coordination Center has received reports of programs that launch
denial-of-service attacks by creating a "UDP packet storm" either on a system
or between two systems. An attack on one host causes that host to perform
poorly. An attack between two hosts can cause extreme network congestion in
addition to adversely affecting host performance.

The CERT staff recommends disabling unneeded UDP services on each host, in
particular the chargen and echo services, and filtering these services at the
firewall or Internet gateway.

Because the UDP port denial-of-service attacks typically involve IP spoofing,
we encourage you to follow the recommendations in advisory CA-96.21.

We will update this advisory as we receive additional information.
Please check advisory files regularly for updates that relate to your site

- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

I.   Description

     When a connection is established between two UDP services,
     each of which produces output, these two services can produce a
     very high number of packets that can lead to a denial of service
     on the machine(s) where the services are offered. Anyone with network
     connectivity can launch an attack; no account access is needed.

     For example, by connecting a host's chargen service to the echo service
     on the same or another machine, all affected machines may be
     effectively taken out of service because of the excessively high number
     of packets produced. In addition, if two or more hosts are so connected,
     the intervening network may also become congested and deny service
     to all hosts whose traffic traverses that network.

II.  Impact

     Anyone with network connectivity can cause a denial of service.
     This attack does not enable them to gain additional access.

III. Solution

     We recommend taking all the steps described below.

     1. Disable and filter chargen and echo services.
        This attack is most readily exploited using the chargen or echo
        services, neither of which is generally needed as far as we are aware.
        We recommend that you disable both services on the host and filter
        them at the firewall or Internet gateway.

        To disable these services on a host, it is necessary to edit the
        inetd configuration file and cause inetd to begin using the new
        configuration. Exactly how to do this is system dependent so you
        should check your vendor's documentation for inetd(8); but on many
        UNIX systems the steps will be as follows:
         (1) Edit the inetd configuration file (e.g. /etc/inetd.conf).
         (2) Comment out the echo, chargen, and other UDP services not used.
         (3) Cause the inetd process to reread the configuration file
             (e.g., by sending it a HUP signal).

     2. Disable and filter other unused UDP services.
        To protect against similar attacks against other services, we
        recommend
           -  disabling all unused UDP services on hosts and
           -  blocking at firewalls all UDP ports less than 900 with
              the exception of specific services you require, such as
              DNS (port 53).

     3. If you must provide external access to some UDP services, consider
        using a proxy mechanism to protect that service from misuse.
        Techniques to do this are discussed in Chapter 8, "Configuring
        Internet Services," in _Building Internet Firewalls_ by Chapman
        and Zwicky (see Section IV below).

     4. Monitor your network.
        If you do provide external UDP services, we recommend monitoring
        your network to learn which systems are using these services and
        to monitor for signs of misuse. Tools for doing so include Argus,
        tcpdump, and netlog.

        Argus is available from
             ftp://ftp.net.cmu.edu/pub/argus-1.5/
             MD5 (argus-1.5.tar.gz) = 9c7052fb1742f9f6232a890267c03f3c

             Note that Argus requires the TCP wrappers to install:
             ftp://info.cert.org/pub/tools/tcp_wrappers/tcp_wrappers_7.2.tar.Z
             MD5 (tcp_wrappers_7.2.tar.Z) = 883d00cbd2dedd9bfc783b7065740e74

       tcpdump is available from
             ftp://ftp.ee.lbl.gov/tcpdump-3.0.2.tar.Z
             MD5 (tcpdump-3.0.2.tar.Z) = c757608d5823aa68e4061ebd4753e591

             Note that tcpdump requires libpcap, available at
                 ftp://ftp.ee.lbl.gov/libpcap-0.0.6.tar.Z
                 MD5 (libpcap-0.0.6.tar.Z) = cda0980f786932a7e2eebfb2641aa7a0

       netlog is available from
              ftp://net.tamu.edu/pub/security/TAMU/netlog-1.2.tar.gz
              MD5 (netlog-1.2.tar.gz) = 1dd62e7e96192456e8c75047c38e994b

      5. Take steps against IP spoofing.
         Because IP spoofing is typically involved in UDP port
         denial-of-service attacks, we encourage you to follow the
         guidance in advisory CA-95:01, available from

               ftp://info.cert.org/pub/cert_advisories/CA-95:01.IP.spoofing
