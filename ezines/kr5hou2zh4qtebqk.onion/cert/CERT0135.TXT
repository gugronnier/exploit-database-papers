Topic: Vulnerability in IRIX csetup
- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

The CERT Coordination Center has received information about a vulnerability in
the csetup program under IRIX versions 5.x, 6.0, 6.0.1, 6.1, and 6.2. csetup is
not available under IRIX 6.3 and 6.4.

By exploiting this vulnerability, local users can create or overwrite
arbitrary files on the system. With this leverage, they can ultimately gain
root privileges.

Exploitation information involving this vulnerability has been made publicly
available.

We recommend applying a vendor patch when possible. In the meantime, we urge
sites to apply the workaround described in Section III.

We will update this advisory as we receive additional information.
Please check advisory files regularly for updates that relate to your site.

Note: Development of this advisory was a joint effort of the CERT Coordination
      Center and AUSCERT.

I.   Description

        There is a vulnerability in the csetup program under IRIX versions
        5.x, 6.0, 6.0.1, 6.1, and 6.2. csetup is not available under IRIX 6.3
        and 6.4.

        csetup is part of the Desktop System Administration subsystem. The
        program provides a graphical interface allowing privileged users,
        as flagged in the objectserver (cpeople (1M)), or root to modify
        system and network configuration parameters. The csetup program is
        setuid root to allow those who are flagged as privileged users to
        modify system critical files.

        It is possible to configure csetup to run in DEBUG mode, creating a
        logfile in a publicly writable directory. This file is created in an
        insecure manner; and because csetup is running with root privileges at
        the time the logfile is created, it is possible for local users to
        create or overwrite arbitrary files on the system.

        Exploit information involving this vulnerability has been made
        publicly available.

II.  Impact

        Anyone with access to an account on the system can create or overwrite
        arbitrary files on the system. With this leverage, they can ultimately
        gain root privileges.

III. Solution

        Patch information for this vulnerability is available
        in SGI"s Security Advisory 19970101-02-PX, available at

             http://www.sgi.com/Support/Secur/security.html/
