PHREAKING TIPS
--------------

SAY YOUR FAVORITE BOARD IS BUSY, AND
YOU *HAVE* TO GET ON. WELL, IN MOST
CASES, YOU'RE STUCK--AND WAIT FOR THE
OTHER PERSON TO FINISH WHAT THEY'RE
DOING.

BUT IF YOU DO THIS, YOU GET IN! (AND
IN MOST CASES, INSIDE THE PERSONS ACCT
THAT WAS THERE BEFORE YOU!):

1) DIAL 0.
2) ASK THE OPERATOR TO "PLEASE MAKE
   AN IMERGENCY INTURRUPT AT XXX-XXXX."
3) IF SHE ASKS "WHY?", HANG UP & TRY
   AGAIN. (YOU'LL GET ANOTHER OPERATOR)
4) IF SHE DOSEN'T, YOUR IN!...
