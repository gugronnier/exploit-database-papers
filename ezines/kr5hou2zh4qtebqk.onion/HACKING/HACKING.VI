NOT MUCH GOING ON, SO HERE GOES...

TONES
-----

(IF YOU DON'T HAVE A TOUCH-TONE PHONE,
SKIP THIS PART.)


LOOK AT YOUR PHONE. NOW NOTICE THE
ARRANGEMENT OF THE KEYS. IT LOOKS LIKE
THIS:

     ___ ___ ___ 
    \   \   \   \
    \ 1 \ 2 \ 3 \
    \___\___\___\
    \   \   \   \
    \ 4 \ 5 \ 6 \
    \___\___\___\
    \   \   \   \
    \ 7 \ 8 \ 9 \
    \___\___\___\
    \   \   \   \
    \ * \ 0 \ # \
    \___\___\___\


YOU CAN CREATE VARIOUS TONES BY
PRESSING MORE DIFFERENT KEYS AT THE
SAME TIME.

RIGHT NOW, I CANNOT THINK OF A USE FOR
THE FOLLOWING KEYS, BUT THEY ARE NICE
TO KNOW. THEY PRODUCE F, G, A
AND B FLAT, RESPECTIVELY:
(GEE, NOW YOU HAVE A BETTER WAY TO
PLAY MARY-HAD-A-LITTLE-LAMB THAN
PRESSING 1, 2, & 3)

   1-2 ] THESE ALL PRODUCE
   1-3 ] THE SAME TONE.
   2-3 ] [F]

   4-5 ] THESE ALL PRODUCE
   4-6 ] THE SAME TONE.
   5-6 ] [G]

   7-8 ] THESE ALL PRODUCE
   7-9 ] THE SAME TONE.
   8-9 ] [A]

   *-0 ] THESE ALL PRODUCE
   *-# ] THE SAME TONE.
   0-# ] [B FLAT]


THESE KEYS PRODUCE CARRIER-LIKE TONES:

  3-6 ]
  3-9 ] THESE ALL
  3-# ] PRODUCE A
  6-9 ] CARRIER FOR
  6-# ] 300 BAUD (ALMOST)
  9-# ]

  2-5 ]
  2-8 ] THESE ALL
  2-0 ] PRODUCE A
  5-8 ] SORT OF CARRIER
  5-0 ] (ONE NOTE BELOW)
  8-0 ]

  1-4 ]
  1-7 ] THESE ALL
  1-* ] PRODUCE A
  4-7 ] TONE 2 NOTES
  4-* ] BELOW A CARRIER
  7-* ]

TO PUT SOMEONE ON HOLD, PUSH THE
9 AND 5 KEYS AND HOLD THEM DOWN.
RELEASE THEM WHEN DONE. THERE ARE ALOT
MORE COMBINATIONS THAT WORK BUT IT IS
USELESS TO LIST THEM ALL HERE.

THE WHITE HOUSE
---------------

I COULDN'T RESIST PUTTING THIS IN,
ALTHOUGH EVERYONE SHOULD HAVE IT.

      >>>>>202-456-1414<<<<

TIS IS THE NATIONAL NUMBER.

BLACK BOX
---------

A BLACK BOX IS ESSENTIALLY USELESS TO
PHREAKS BECAUSE YOU CANNOT MAKE OUT-
GOING CALLS FOR FREE WITH IT BUT THIS
IS HOW IT WORKS:

SAY YOUR FRIEND IN ATLANTA WANTED TO
CALL YOU BUT DIDN'T WANT TO PAY FOR
THE CALL. THIS  CAN BE ACCOMPLISHED
WITH A BLACK BOX.

BASICALLY, A RESISTER IS PUT INSIDE
THE PHONE THAT MAKES IT SO THAT WHEN
YOU AND YOUR FRIEND ARE CONNECTED,
THE VOLTAGE ACROSS THE LINE IS JUST
ENOUGH TO KEEP THE PHONE WORKING (THE
SAME VOLTAGE THAT GOES THROUGH WHEN
IT RINGS), BUT NOT ENOUGH TO START
BILLING AND YOU DON'T GET CHARGED
FOR RINGING THE PHONE NOW, DO YOU?

THE PROBLEM IS THAT THE WHOLE
TIME YOU ARE CONNECTED, BELL THINKS
THAT YOUR PHONE IS RINGING. SO
KEEP YOUR CALLS SHORT -- LIKE 2 MIN OR
LESS. * WARNING: BELL CAN RANDOMLY
CHECK FOR THESE ONES SO LOOK OUT.

HERE ARE THE SCHEMATICS FOR A BLACK:


+--GREEN WIRE-----
                 !
                 !
                /   SWITCH  (SPST
                  /          TOGGLE
                 !           SWITCH)
                 !
                 !
                <RR>  ("RR" SCREW ON
                 !     MAIN BOX)
                 !
              RESISTOR (10K, 1/2 WATT,
                 !      AND 10%)
                 !
                 !
                 !
                <F>   ("F" SCREW)
                / \
               /   \
              !     !
              !     !
            BLUE   WHITE
            WIRE   WIRE
              !     !
              !     !
              +     +


AFTER YOU HAVE ASSEMBLED IT, FLIP THE
SWITCH UP. IF YOU GET A DIAL TONE,
MARK THIS "NORMAL". NOW FLIP IT DOWN,
MARK THIS "FREE". YOU SHOULD LEAVE IT
AS NORMAL NORMALY, THOUGH.. WHAT IF
MA BELL CALLS AND THE THING'S AT FREE?

WHEN SOMEONE CALLS (AT A PRE-ARRANGED
TIME) QUICKLY LIFT AND DROP THE
RECIEVER (THIS IS TO STOP THE RINGING)
THEN FLIP THE SWITCH TO FREE AND PICK
UP THE PHONE.

AND THERE YOU HAVE IT. YOUR VERY OWN
BLACK BOX (IT'S NICE TO TALK ABOUT HOW
USELESS IT IS -- BUT IT'S BETTER TO
DO IT)

WELL, THAT'S ALL FOR THIS ISSUE..

VOLUME SEVEN CAN'T BE THAT FAR AWAY..
WATCH FOR IT..
