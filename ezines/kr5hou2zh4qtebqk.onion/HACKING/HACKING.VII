PREFACE
-------

VOLUME SIX WAS (IN MY OPINION) THE
WORST H.A.C.K.  BUT THIS TIME, I
PROMISE IT TO BE BETTER.

IN VOLUME SEVEN, WE WILL EXPLORE THE
POSSIBILITYS OF SOME VARIOUS NEW IDEAS
THOUGHT UP BY MOI.

CREATED TODAY, 6/12/84.

TONES & BLUE BOXES
------------------

JUST ANOTHER WORD ABOUT THE TONES
DISSCUSSED LAST TIME. FOR A TONE TO BE
USEFULL AS IN BLUE BOX (MAKES YOU AN
"0" OPERATOR, ALMOST), IT MUST BE
A COMBINATION OF TWO TONES MIXED
TOGETHER. NOW, IF YOU HAVE TWO PHONE
LINES, AND CAN MERGE THE CALLS
(CONFERANCE CALLING, BUT NOT THE SAME
AS THE ONE AT&T OFFERS, YOU NEED 2
LINES) AND GET A DIAL TONE ON EACH END,
THEN YOU CAN PRODUCE THE TONES IN THE
LAST VOLUME (1-3, 4-6, 7-9, *-#)
NORMALY. BUT THEN, YOU CAN PRODUCE 2
DIFFERENT TONES ON EACH PHONE (LINE),
THUS PRODUCING THE DUAL TONES REQUIRED.
NOW, DON'T FROGET THAT REGULAR TOUCH-
TONE DIGITS ARE ALSO A COMBINATION
OF TONES (THAT'S WHY THEY'RE CALLED
DTMF, DUAL-TONE MULTI-FREQUENCY) BUT
FOR USE AS A BLUE BOX, THE TONES NEED
TO BE MUCH HIGHER (2600HZ SOUND
FARMILIAR?).

NOW IF WE CAN MODIFY THE STANDARD NET-
WORKS BOX (INSIDE YOUR PHONE) TO MAKE
THESE TONES, THERE YOU HAVE THE
BEGINNINGS FOR YOUR BASIC BLUE BOX.

NOW AN APPLE-CAT CAN PRODUCE ALL KINDS
OF FREQ... AND CAN, AND IS USED AS A
BLUE BOX, (ASK AROUND, ANYONE SHOULD
HAVE IT.. ONLY 3 FILES OR SO.. [I HAVE
A SMARTMODEM 1200].) OF COURSE, YOU CAN
BUILD A BOX TO MAKE THESE TONES TOO,
AND THAT IS EXACTLY WHAT A HARDWARE-
BLUE BOX IS.

KKK COMPUTER
------------

I HEARD THERE IS A KKK COMPUTER IN
CALIF.. I THINK THIS MIGHT BE AN
INSERESTING PLACE TO HACK SSOOOO.. IF
ANYONE HAS ANY INFO ON IT (LIKE THE #),
POST IT SOMEWHERE. THANX..

HAVE FUN..

LINE KILLING
------------

EVER WANT TO DIS-CONNECT SOME POOR
FELLOW'S PHONE LINE? TRY THIS SOMETIME:
CALL AT&T AND TELL THEM YOU WANT
TEMPORARILY DISCONNECT YOUR PHONE
BECAUSE YOU'RE GOING ON VACATION &
CAN'T AFFORD TO KEEP IT WORKING
OVER THE 2 WEEKS (OR HOWEVER LONG YOU
WANT TO KEEP YOUR VICTIM IN PAIN) SO
COULD THEY PLEASE DIS-CONNECT SERVICES
FOR TWO WEEKS? THANK YOU.

GENERALLY, THIS (AND ANYTHING ELSE)
SHOULD BE DONE FROM A FORTRESS PHONE
[OR NOT YOURS ANYWAY, ANYWAY]
