Ten Lethal or Incapacitating Drugs Stored by the CIA:
  Yep, the CIA actually does store these drugs.  Or atleast, they did as
  of 1976.  Makes you wish you worked there huh?
  1.  Aconitine Nitrate - More commonly known as wolfsbane, legend has it 
      that this druf will cure lycanthropy (the werewolf disease).  It causes
      severe abdominal discomfort in small doses and death in large doses.
  2.  BZ - An experimental drug, BZ blocks nerve impulses and causes death.
  3.  Carbachol - This drug produces a wide variety of symptoms among which
      are flushing, colic, diarrhea, salivation, and nausea.
  4.  Cinchonine - This drug is used in medicine to treat Malaria.  Overdoses
      cause severe nausea, vomiting, and heart malfunction.
  5.  Cobra Venom - This is the deadly poison obtained from the snake.  It
      kills by paralyzing the nervous system.
  6.  Colchicine - A drug, overdoses of which cause muscle paralysis and
      respiratory failure resulting in death.
  7.  Cyanide - The suicide drug (sodium or potassium cyanide) used by spies
      during W.W. II to escape being totured into revealing secret 
      information.  The drug blocks the absorbtion of oxygen and death occurs 
      rapidly as a result of asphyxiation.
  8.  S-341 - An experimental drug similar to BZ but even more powerful.
  9.  Saxitoxin - More commonly known as shellfish toxin, saxitoxin produces
      death in seconds by causing failure of the body's respiratory, 
      cardio-vascular, nerve, and muscle systems.
  10. Strychnine - Once used by doctors as a nerve stimulant, in anything
      but small doses it paralyzes nerve-muscle junctions and causes death.

Common Poisonous Plants:
  By popular demand, here is a list of the twenty most easily accessable   
  poisonous plants.  Warning, this is real shit.  These plants will really
  do what it says they do.  This is not a joke.  Okay, now that that's over,
  a warning to you people committing suicide.  It may take alot of the plant
  to kill you.  I haven't exactly tested all of these, so I don't know how
  accurate this list is.  By the way, be sure not to mention BOOM in your 
  suicide note.
