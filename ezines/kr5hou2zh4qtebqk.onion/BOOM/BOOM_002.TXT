This issue is dedicated to fun with lighters and other people's cars.  Two of 
the tricks, shower of sparks from nowhere and what to do with a left over 
lighter casing are taken from Phrack issue #6.  They have been modified 
slightly.  We would like to give credit to the Leftist for writing the 
original article in Phrack.

Shower of sparks from nowhere:
  This trick is done usually with an empty lighter.  Disassemble the top, 
  being careful not to loose the flint, and the spring, which are under the 
  striker wheel.  Throw away everything else, unless there is still some fluid 
  in the lighter, which can be used for some of the other things in this file.  
  Save the flint and spring.

  Ok, now take the spring, and pull on the end a little, and stretch the 
  spring out a little longer than the flint.  Next, take the flint, and kind 
  of wrap the end of the spring around it.  It should look sort of like the 
  picture below.  Next, the fun part.  Take the spring, and hold it by the end 
  that doesn't have flint on it, and heat the flint till it glows.  Don't 
  worry, the heat won't burn your fingers.  Then, throw it flint first at 
  victim, pavement, or whatever.

What to do with leftover lighter casing (Bic or compatable):
  Light one of the striker wheel supports, and lay it upside down in a corner 
  and run like hell!  This will blow pretty good.  You can also take the 
  casing and wrap it loosely in a paper towel (or cover it with rubber cement
  or use a Chud varient), light the towel (or whatever), step back, and 
  shoot it with a BB gun.  Fun.  Experiment, but don't ever puncture the 
  lighter while you're holding it, that would be foolish.

How to get a big flame (with a Bic or compatable):
  So, you want more flame than that little adjuster dohicky will give ya huh?
  Well, just pry off the metal casing and turn that plastic thing as far as
  you want.  You can get alot more flame that way.  Don't be a dumbass though.
  After doing this to his lighter, this moron I knew stuck the lighter right
  up to his face to see how much bigger the flame was and burned off one of 
  his eyelashes.

Things to do to a Zippo:
  Okay, your friend got a really nice Zippo.  What do you do?  Zippos are
  really cool lighters because they are reusable.  That also makes them
  susceptable to sabatoge though.  If just wanna piss him off, open up his
  Zippo (when he's not looking of course) and wash all of the lighter fluid
  out of it.  Replace the fluid with water.  Then, have fun laughing at him
  as he tries to dry it out.

  Want to have a little fun with him?  Replace the lighter fluid with gas.
  Watch the expression on his face when he lights that baby.

  The Commie approach - In Vietnam, Commie spies would take out the insides
  of a Zippo and rig it up so that if you light them up, the C-4 inside would
  blow up.  Several people got thier hands blown off this way.  However,
  unless you have some spare C-4 and a ride outta town I wouldn't recommend
  this method.

  Take apart the Zippo again (and again when the owner isn't looking).  Take
  out the sponge-like thing that holds the lighter fluid.  Cover it with super
  glue.  Then, put the fuel holder back in the Zippo.  In a little while, your
  friend will be able to forget about ever refilling that lighter.

  Take a close look at the Zippo.  Notice the inclosed area where the wick is?
  Okay, take some Chud (see BOOM #1) and put some in there.  Be careful 
  though, you still want this to light.  Then when the owner doesn't notice
  the white flammable substance and lights the lighter, his Zippo will start
  on fire (well, more than normal.)

  And finally, try using your friend's Zippo as bait one day while you're 
  fishing.

Fun Things to do to Someone Else's Car:
  So, there's someone you don't like.  You wanna get him bad right?  Well,
  ever consider his/her car?  Here are some mischevious things to do to a car:
   1. Pop the tires.  Pretty simple, take a big sharp object and cut a slit
      right down the length of the tire.
   2. Take out the battery.  Physically remove the battery from your friend's
      car.  Then, watch his face as he lifts up the hood and finds that his
      battery is missing.
   3. Wreck his paint job.  Just make his car look bad by wrecking his paint
      job.  You could take a key a scrap a line down the length of the car.
      Or, you could be creative and use acid.  Probably one of strongest and
      cheapest acids is Hydrochloric acid.  Hydrochloric acid is found in
      Works toilet bowl cleaner.
   4. Set a Works bomb inside the car.  If your friend leaves his car
      unlocked, simply open the door and put a Works bomb inside (see above.)
      If your friend locks his doors, break a window and unlock them.  Then
      put the Works bomb inside.
   5. Put sugar in his gas tank.  The sugar expands and eats away at the
      insides of the car.  Someone I kew had this done to his car and had to
      pay $2000 to have the car fixed.
   6. Put popcorn seeds in the gas tank.  The gas will get hot and the seeds
      will pop.  I can only theorize that this would cause a shitload of
      damage.  If you know anyone who has done this or had it done to them,
      contact me.  I want to know exactly what this prank does.
   7. Take the hubcap off and remove all the bolts.  Caution, this is
      dangerous for both you and your enemy (especially if he finds out you
      did it!)  But we're not worried 'cause we won't take responsibility for
      use of anything in this file!

  Further issues to come....
