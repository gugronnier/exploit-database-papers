Take a close look at the screen in front of you.  The first change you should
notice is the second name listed.  It is Case.  Yes, that's right, Count Zero
has decided to change his name back to Case.  While on the subject of names,
it has come to our attention that there is another Cerberus.  The other
Cerberus is an ACiD member.  Note that the Cerberus who writes this
newsletter is NOT in ACiD (however, ACiD can beg for his membership through
the board listed above <grin>).

This issue is dedicated to fireworks.  As far as we know, everything in this
issue is legal (I know, we're sorry).  But, don't worry, issue 9 will include
the "Anarchist's Toolbox" and the theme of issue 10 is "High Explosives."

Pocket Rocket (aka Match Rocket):
  Have you ever wanted a simple, easy to make rocket?  Well, we can't promise
  you'll get much hang time with this rocket but it is fun to make and fly.
  About the highest you can hope for a Pocket Rocket to go is eight feet.
 Ingredients:
  a match (paper not wood)
  an inch square of aluminum foil
  a pin
  a lighter (Zippo type recommended)
 Directions:
  Take the match and cover the tip with the aluminum foil.  Then, use the pin
  to create an exhaust hole.  To launch, set the rocket up however you want
  it and heat it with the lighter.

Colored Flames:
  So, you want to really impress the neighbors huh?  Try multi-colored
  flames.  Below is a list of different colors and what you burn to create
  them.
  
  Color               Material                       Used in
  -----               --------                       -------
  red                 strontium salts                road flares,
                      (strontium nitrate)            red sparklers
  green               barium salts                   green sparklers
                      (barium nitrate)
  yellow              sodium salts                   gold sparklers
                      (sodium nitrate)
  blue                powdered copper                blue sparklers,
                      old pennies
  white               powdered magnesium             firestarters,
                      or aluminum                    aluminum foil
  purple              potassium permanganate         purple fountains,
                                                     treating sewage

Firecrackers:
  This method can also be used to make a nice delivery system for smoke
  powder.
 Ingedients:
  some powdered explosive (black or flash recommended)
  a paper tube
  epoxy
  a fuse
  some waxpaper
 Directions:
  Lay the tube on one end on the waxpaper.  Then, put alot of Apoxy down it.
  This is to make the end hard.  After this, make a hole in the side.  Put
  the fuse in this hole.  Then pour your powder in the tube.  Fill it up real
  good.  Now pour some more Apoxy down the tube.  Let it dry and you're
  ready to light.
 Notes:
  Try the above substances to add some color to your firework.  Also, try
  mounting the firecrackers on model rockets.

Roman Candles:
  Yes you can make roman candles.  No, it's not that easy.  NOTE:  we
  recommend Pyrodex and flash powder.  However, normal gun powder (from
  issue 7) can be used as a replacment for both.
 Ingedients:
  1/2 inch thick card board tube
  duct tape or paper (to reinforce the above tube)
  epoxy
  fuse (waterproof recommended)
  waxpaper
  Pyrodex (or gun powder)
  flash powder (or gun powder)
  two 6-inch sparklers of the desired color
  water
 Directions:
  Start by reinforcing the tube.  You can either do this with duct tape or
  by glueing paper (or cardboard) to the sides.  Skip this if you feel your
  tube is thick enough.  Put the tube on the waxpaper.  Seal on end with the
  epoxy.  Now, poke a hole in the epoxy big enough for your fuse.  Then put
  your fuse in the hole.  Pour about one inch of Pyrodex (or gun powder) in
  the open end of the tube.  Now comes the tricky part.  Make a mixture of
  sparkler material, flash powder, and Pyrodex in the following ratio:
        60% sparkler material
        20% flash powder
        20% Pyrodex
  After you have mixed up the powders well, add water one drop at a time
  while mixing the powders continuously until a damp paste is formed.  Do
  not use to much water.  Now, mold the paste into a ball and allow it to
  dry.  Then put the ball in the tube and light.

Solid Rocket Fuel:
  There are about as many different kinds of rocket fuel as there are rocket
  fuel makers.  However, we will only present the two we have had the most
  luck with.  One is almost the same as gun powder and the other one uses
  sugar.
 Method I:
  Ingedients:
   8 parts Potassium Nitrate (salt peter)
   6 parts Charcoal Dust
   2 parts Sulfur
  Directions:
   Mix all the ingedients together.  Then moisen with a little water.
 Method II:
  Ingedients:
   65% Potassium Nitrate (salt peter)
   25% Sugar
   10% Sulfur
  Directions:
   Mix all the ingedients together.  Moisen only if necessary.

Whistles:
  Lighting this mixture in an enclosed container will result in a hissing or
  a loud 'BOOOOOOM.'
 Ingredients:
  7 parts Potassium Perchlorate
  3 parts Sodium Salicylate
 Directions: 
  Simply mix together and put in an enclosed container (like the firecracker
  from this issue.)

Watson's Thoughts (er, ramblings):
  Hello, Some friends of mine (and some people that only 
  like me becuase I make a funny noise when you throw walnuts 
  at me) asked me "Watson what do you do when your bored.
  Do you go completely brain dead?" <Editor's Note: I never
  wondered.  I always figured you had sex with Yavo.>
  Well my answer is.... I play car games. Yes it's true 
  you don't have to be in car to play car games, (although
  it's kinda hard if your playing the ones where ya mark off
  road signs, and you're only in your driveway).

  There's always fun car games you can play all the time.
  Like the name game, hit the animal and make it die, 
  I can ryhme, and fire fire who's got the fire.

  If you don't know how to play these, don't worry I'll
  explain them. 

 The Name game:
  Because this game involves two people (don't get any perverted thoughts)
  I invited Yavo, He will start us off.

  Yavo:" Yavo, Yavo, Bo, Bavo..  Fe fi fo Favo"
  Watson:" What the hell are you doing?"
  Yavo:"It's the name game"
  Watson:"Your pretty stupid, here let me start"
  Watson:"Ass munch"
  Yavo:"What?"
  Watson:"No, now you call me something"
  Yavo:"Dill-hole"
  Watson:"wood wacker"
  Yavo:"Toilet plunger"
  Watson: "Two-headed-weasel-dicked-duck-billed-gopher-sucker"
  <Editor's Note: finally, the truth comes out.>
  Yavo:"You are so balled that when you wear a turtle neck you look like a 
   busted condom"
  Watson:"Yavo, your supposed to say single word or small phrase insults
   not stupid jokes"

 Hit The Animal and make it die:
  Again Yavo will aid in this presentaition.

  Watson:"Ready"
  Yavo:"Yep"
  Yavo:"Owww, shit oww stop it owww damn it quit it"
  Watson:"I hope you people weren't getting perverted ideas about that
   I was just simply showing that the purpose of this game is to kick the
   shit out of some animal that can't defend itself, and I found Yavo 
   to be a good example.  Of course, in a car you would just run into them
   but you get the Idea."

 I Can ryhme:
  Yavo:"Heart Attack"
  Watson:"Hard hat mac?"
  Yavo:"Eat a sack"
  Watson:"Willy wack"
  Yavo:"broken back"
  Watson:"Burn a shack"
  Yavo:"kill a duck"
  Watson:"You stupid F#%*!"
  Yavo:"Empty gun rack"
  Watson:"You don't ryhme to well do you Yavo?"
  Watson:"Big butt crack"
  Yavo:"stinky cow pack"
  Watson:"Burn a tack"
  Yavo:"Guy named Zach"
  Watson"Burn Chris Slack"
  Yavo:"Eat some cheese"
  Watson".......... Yavo go home"

 Fire Fire Who's got the Fire:
  Watson:"Yavo look at your hair"
  Yavo:"Ahhhhhhh!"
  Watson:"That was a quick game Yavo found the fire right away"
