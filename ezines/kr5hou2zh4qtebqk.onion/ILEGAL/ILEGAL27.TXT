MAD ALL'S MAILBOX

EXCELSIOR, the lean mean gossip machine is back, so turn on the music, grab a
bottle of beer, sit back and enjoy...

- Remember JAZOO of old Jazzcat fame, well he's back. This time he joined the
ranks of that other Norweigan group: THE SHADOWS, they are all delighted, coz
he promised the originals, TDF in trouble?

- I was planning to write a big article on this but I'm too modest (or lazy?)
so I'll just print it here: CFR has split up. Yes yes yes it's true but before
you get out a box of kleenex let me assure you that we'll still continue under
the same name, the people that are gone only worked on Amiga (well not really
coz they only wrote one demo in 6 months and they wanted CFR to become an Amiga
group only so naturally we split up, but this will have no effect on our 64
work.

- OOOH aren't those Beastie Boys getting a little big-headed, in their
interview in Delirious Mag ACCEPT claims that all groups are lame except the 9
groups they trade with, not a bad statement for a group that brought out a 1328
Block long OUTRUN version.

- As you probably know, C64CG, DCU and PLEASURE are merging together to become
bigger but did you know the name? Well they are planning to announce it at the
Venlo meeting of 16/04/88 but I couldn't resist so here goes: they will be
called TRANSCOM.

- Interesting to see at the last VENLO meeting that TSS and LETHAL of HOTLINE
had a very big discussion with HI-TEC and TK of TRIAD concerning who was the
better group, luckily they didn't have a quarrel over who was the biggest group
otherwise they would still be there counting all their members coz both of them
have well over 25 members.

- On Hotline: I almost got lynched by some HOTLINE members coz they claimed
that we in "ILLEGAL" only ever talk about SLEDGEHAMMER, so I asked LETHAL (in
fact it was Lethal's own idea) to write a very big and complete article about
the AMIGA virus. He will do all the research as he has access to ZILLIONS of
computer magazines an I will write the article so look out for that!

- Poor old Denmark and Germany, the groups seem to be falling like flies over
there lately, the police is really beginning to hold razzia's and PLK's and PO
Boxes get searched through, a real unhealthy situation, hopefully this is no
sign for other countries.

- I bet you a lot of hard cash that STRIDER of FAIRLIGHT won't stay away for
long now that he stopped cracking on the 64, just wait until he meets everybody
at the April edition of Venlo, he'll see that the 64 is much more lively than
the Amiga. C U there Toni.

- Two Belgian groups China Syndrome (CSI) and 4-Star have joined together to
produce higher quality cracks.

!!!: Well, the first issue if "ILLEGAL" appeared on the 6th of January 1986
     after two weeks wondering how "Newsroom" works. It took about one single
     page and had a circulation of 5 copies. GOSH! It was so bad that I won't

!!!: And you, Jeffie. HAHAHAHAHAHA

Next time finally Strider from Fairlight who will be interviewed in Venlo
hopefully!
                                                                             JS


ARCADE ACTION:
ROLLING THUNDER

Have a look at our big cpmparision between ROLLING THUNDER - the arcade
machine, the c 64 version and the Amiga version...

HA! ROLLING THUNDER from NAMCO is quite a brilliant game on the arcade machine.
Task of the game is to free some hostages while shooting all enemies. You can
expand your weapons when entering several rooms, be always careful of swines
with masks that try to blast yoy into pieces of mortal rest. It features
brilliant grafix, a fitting sound and is damn fast. You can either use a MP Iif
you collected ammo) or a small gun, of course the MP is more effective. The
characters are superb animated and you jump one platform up and down in great
animation, too. I really love that game machine cuz it's ultrafast and brings
lots of fun playing it, and it earns a rating of: 96 points of 100 possible.

THE 64 VERSION:
US GOLD tried it... and... failed... A cold shudder seizes me when I remember
this real bad conversion, if the name of the game wasn't ROLLING THUNDER I
would not have noticed it, it's so bad, so fucking slow, you move your player
faster than your bullets... The graphics also suck... this game is the total
rubbish and the best one can do with it, is to open one's window and throw it
out... Even the sprites, the movement of 'em is so bad, I really thought that
it would have been possible to convert it on the 64, cuz there are quite a lot
of that kind of games, but US GOLD? 0 points!!!!!!!!!

THE AMIGA VERSION:
I was really stretched as I took a look on the 16 bit version and GOSH! The
title screen looks pretty nice (me thinks there was no on the 64, wasn't it?),
ah, it remembers me on the arcade version, really. The sound is not that one
from the arcade machine, but nevertheless much, much better than the fuckin'
rubbish on the 64. The game: It's a little bit slower than the arcade machine,
but it's very, very good. It's almost the same fun on the Amiga as on the
Arcade. HA! Okey, the grafix are not so hot, but good, damn good. Compare the
sprites and you really can accept that. I really liked it on the Amiga, so that
my friend, at which home I took a look at ROLLING THUNDER couldn't keep me away
from playing it... "Please another game, C'mon a nu one, okey, now the last
one, yep, no the really last try, yup, my last game" and so on... If companies
always make such brilliant conversions on the Amiga, I can start about thinking
to buy finally a big calculator, eh? Amiga score: 91
                                                                             JS


DOES THE AMIGA KILL THE 64 ??????

"Are you playing again with your calculator?", questions like that are normal
life for a 64 owner when arguing with an Amiga owner! They must tell you, those
who only have to enter their disks in their drives and without typing any
command the game is loaded into the computer, isn't that easy? Now, the latest
state is that some real known guys from the 64 biz changed from 64 to Amiga,
searching for higher goals in SYSTEM FOUR! The two were on the one hand IAN
from FUSION, who almost earned to be a cracker of the month alone and on the
other hand STRIDER from FAIRLIGHT know for many, many cracks with funny slogans
against communists, remember: "Play pool billiard with a commies' ball" or some
like that? Is that a sign for all others?

Well, in fact I think no, cuz the Amiga offers better grafix, better sounds,
okey, but not better games as many of the 64 games are converted now but
without becoming better, you see? No reason for me to sell my little 64 for an
Amiga, ha! Anyway, FUSION also continues as FAIRLIGHT does, and you see that
STRIDER is beginning to write in intro text again (about SYSTEM FOUR...) I
think he will also return to the cracking ones, surely! BIG EASTERN EGGS from:
                                                                     Jeff Smart


THE POLICE IN GERMANY

Everybody who lives in SYSTEM FOUR is scared of the police, that at least in
Germany is very strong and also catched a lot of guys. It had become such a
situation that lamers pretended they were caught showing them belonging to them
who are worth to be catched. Damn lame, isn't it?

The mean methods are ads in obscure computer magazines, that ask you about
swapping, buying software or just a telephone number that offers you to call.
Some guys from the German software police (they really exist!) made such ads to
catch some guys, who are lame enough to call those guys.


"DELIRIOUS" vs "ILLEGAL"

After D.C.U. released the first issue of their new "Delirious Mag" on the Venlo
meeting last month, people thought about a big battle between TRIAD and DCU
concerning their magazines, but they thought totally wrong. There's no
rivality, but a good friendship between Jayce, in his person the editor of the
DCU, now TRANSCOM, magazine and me as I promised him alsways to write him an
article for his magazine but only because I'm a lazy pig the article didn't
reach Jayce in time for the last mag out. Now he got it and I'm sure you can
read about "The German Crackers" in "Delirious Mag No.2". What people didn't
understand is that MAD ALL / CFR is publishing his "Mailbox" in both magazines
and in fact I don't understand, too. But I think it's up to MAD ALL who has of

course the right to publish his articles in both magazines, but still writes
here in "ILLEGAL" more expanded articles. So don't claim... the only thing I
don't like is that DCU can spread their mag for nothing and I have to take
money for it, cuz I don't get copies for free as they do, but it's still OK!
                                                                             JS


GERMAN RATS:
THE A.S.M.

Do you remember the A.S.M.? The "Aktueller Software Markt", the official German
computer magazine (comparable to C+VG in UK) that have been present at the
RADWAR party on January the 9th of 1988? I told you about 'em intha last issue,
but here again. They went around trying to make photos of big and known groups
and published 'em with black stroke over the guys' eyes. And they were quite
proud to see their photos in the March issue of that magazine.

So what about it, you will ask? Well, it can be heard that two members of the
well-known Amiga group "Tristar" were caught by the police!

You must be blind if you don't recognize a connection between the photo in the
A.S.M. that showed the whole "Tristar"-crew and their cruel end. Anyway, after
a couple of weeks later it really can be heard that some guys of the A.S.M.
gave all their photos out to the German software police as special evidence
material. Isn't that nice?

First those swines lick everybody's ass to get an invitation for the party,
then they lick everybody's ass to make some photos and even asked 'em to to
send new warez to 'em... I think it hasn't been all yet.
                                                                             JS


PHONE FREAKIN' NEWS

How what is going this month with the conferences to Germany who has still the
best protected telephonesystem (FUCK)? Well, as it concerns me, I can say that
I had enough conferences this month (Thax to Survivors, Kevin and all others I
don't remember!) and some 3-ways also (with Nik the d...). Anyway I was told
that unknown Shield had started a conference from Germany... Well, no comment!

Anyway it seems that it became easier now for Americans to start conferences,
but I heard bad news, eventhough they aren't proved yet, so I was told that
Badd Boy from The Survivors got busted and had to pay about 1000 Dollars to the
companies.

Hum, I hope it's not true, Johnnie! Anyway, Nik from Ikari even called me on a
free call in the middle of the night (2 a.m.!), for the European it's quite
safe, but all Yanks are afraid of AT&T who really are holding razzias again...

Now it can also be heard that there exists a kind of trick that could remove
poor guys from the black list, eh? Janitor and Mike / F.A.M.E. still are and
look forward to these news... Hear from U on a confy!
                                                                             JS


THE MEETING REPORTS

Only the evergreen Venlo could offer a party intha last month as the WOD party
felt out cuz the guys got in deeper contact with the police...

Anyway the Venlo meeting was a little bit sad as there was simultaneously the
CEBIT, a big computer mess, Germanys small opposite to the PCW show, in
Hannover where quite a lot of friends were present, so did RADWAR, some from
HOTLINE, TRISTAR, MR.ZEROPAGE and so on.

Only a few of the guys that normally come to Venlo showed up on the 19th of
March, so did ORION, C64CG, SLH / HOTLINE, CFR and for the first time DCU from
France. I was told that nothing was up there as people really missed the big
and known groups, but more people showed up than in February and that shows

that Venlo is getting too overcrowded. A cold shudder seized me as I heard how
many lamers asked Hi-Tec of TRIAD to swap.

Anyway, the next Venlo edition seems to become the best ever, so pack yer bag
and show who you are (even if you're a zombie!).
                                                                           Jeff


64

HA! Now ya entered the 64 games review page, congratulations!
Please enter your name:
Okey, serious again, here goes:

* BLOOD VALLEY, a long time ago announced now released... and it's simple RUN-
and-FIGHT game with quite nice grafix and a cool sound fx, but rather boooring
than entertaining. Score: 72 / 100

* IO, one of the shortest names for games ever. It cums from FIREBIRD and even
though it's another (the 2.983.457th of this sort of game) Shoot 'em up, it's
cool. You can get better weapons, but the masterpiece are the grafix that were
drawn by Bob Stevensen (remember BMX Kidz Title Screen). The game is fuckin'
swine to play, so damn difficult, that probably no normal freak is able to get
through that game without a trainer, anyway it scored: 84 / 100

* VENOM STRIKES BACK, MASK III. The third part of the hopefully soon ending
Mask Games series, but it's much better than the preceding ones, another Shoot
'em up, but it brings fun anyway. Use digits for changing your player
character. Score: 72 / 100

* SUPER HANG ON, God, another arcade machine converted by Activision. The name
is counting, not the game, so it'll probably be a success like OUTRUN, but
there are no differences to other games like that as ENDURO RACER or BUGGY BOY
(the best of that kind), nice sounds, nevertheless a bad conversion, scoring:
39

* IKARI WARRIORS, as everybody thought ELITE released the European version and
it's a damn good game with no connection to the USA version, luckily. With a
fine intro the game features the blastin' of thousands of enemies and many
more... try to get through the whole game, nice sprites as an ending sequence,
damn good Shoot 'em up, so 88.

* CORPORATION, another stunning new game concept from ACTIVISION it takes place
in the year 3026 and you must succeed in your mission in order not to loose
your job, cool grafix, a cooler title tune, and a very cool game, so 92 / 100.

* SINBAD and the throne of the falcon from CINEMAWARE looks different from the
Amiga version with more play sequences and less tactical moves, nevertheless
the grafix are fantastic (the normal standard for CINEMAWARE) but the game gets
boring, cuz it's damn hard to play, compare the title sound from the 64 to the
Amiga tune, funny, funny, eh? But still a very, very good conversion from 16
bit to 8 bit, one can only hope for more games from the best graphicians, 92 /
100.

* TARGET RENEGADE, the follow up to RENEGADE, this time featurin' a pure
joystick control and GOSH! the game is hot! OCEAN improved it with better
grafix and more levels, so it had become a multi-load game. Watch out for the
ending sequence, fantastic great job, score: 92 / 100.

* TROLL, from DENTON DESIGNS shows a great title piccy and cute game grafix,
but what for the hell is the aim of that game? Funny anyway so a score of 86.

* PACLAND, a well done conversion from the arcade machine featurin' everything
that one is used to play with, when you have to help old Pacman, f1 to enter
credits, f3 one and f5 two players and 88 pts.

* RIMRUNNER, what a cool grafix at the beginning of the game in which you have
to ride on your, eh?... on your, hum? Anyway, you ride and have to be careful
of defective generators and it's your task to repair 'em. A great sound let
this game get 90 points.

* SCOUT, written by IAN+MIC who used to be members of TRIAD, sold to
MASTERTRONIC featurin' sounds from JT. Really not a bad game, driving and
jumping, shootin' up, but slowly it gets boring, nevertheless 82 points.

* THE THREE STOOGES, anutha masterpiece from CINEMAWARE with a brilliant
conversion of a movie into a computer game, the graphics is of course also fab
as the game is. Score: 94 points.

* THE GAMES: WINTER EDITION, still remember the frustration when you told your
friends in the USA to send it as fast as possible and then it didn't work?
Well, fortunately we had two salvators, JANITOR and MR.ZEROPAGE. Anyway, the
game isn't as good as CALIFORNIA GAMES, maybe cuz of EPYX lost Mikael Kosaka to
ELECTRONIC ARTS, who made all the fine grafix formerly. THE GAMES:

1) LUGE, nice grafix, use joystick down at the beginning, and then sometimes
down + button to get speed, quite nice but not exciting.

2) CROSS COUNTRY: remember Speed Skating in old Winter Games, same movements
here. Grafix not bad, nice scrolling, split screen.

3) FIGURE SKATING: lots of details, first choose yer music, make the choice of
the jumps you want to make during the music then try to play, quite difficult,
eh?

4) SKI JUMP: nice features, but when you fly through the air you can't
recognize how far you flew, that's quite bad, but it brings fun, cuz it's also
difficult to make good jumps.

5) SPEED SKATING: moving the joystick with the player.

6) SLALOM: left, right, left, right, you only have to concentrate a bit to be
successful.

7) DOWNHILL is more Slalom than Downhill, but probably the best event.

All together very good, but it's not CALIFORNIA GAMES, so: 95 points.
                                                                             JS

COMPLEMENTS OF SCG

The legend returns!

The awesome people from the gaff of Liverpool, England are back! (The SCOUSE
CRACKING GROUP, that is! - What do you mean you've never heard of us?!).

So here we are, after a short (ish) but much needed, much enjoyed, quite-nice-
really break. We have regrouped and returned, and are going to totally and
utterly quash the ideals and concepts of the current hacking kingdom... but,
being such modest, selfless people we will move the trend of the conversation
into other areas of interesting-information-to-know. This includes:

1. Our views on the now-barren cracking world
2. The Scouse House future plans
3. General waffle and moaning
4. There is, in fact, no number 1
5. Ah! Here it is

Rightio then, let's hit the dog on the head and get down on it.

At the present, we at the Scouse tavern think that there is an agglomeration of
minor groups, whom has slowly but surely engulfed the top names, plunging them
into the boundless infinity of non-existence.

Who can't all the smaller groups make like a wolf and pack together or else
make like a kangaroo and take a running jump.

What has happened to quality (look it up in a dictionary!), for some reason
groups seem to be forsaking this ideal for quantity... lemons (people not in
this group) want trainers, documents and good intros...

Are most intro-writers communists? Because nowadays all intros look the same to
us (maybe it's just us!).

We haven't been on a good confy for donkeys years, what happened to the good
old days of 20 or more interesting people on one confy (is this some kind of
subtle hint?).

What are our future plans, then? We have only one... to put quality before
quantity, this meaning that our cracks will be really quite orgasimic.

Talking about cracks, speed is an advantage but surely receiving a game which
has more features increses its wantability.

Incidently, we at Scouse dislike extremely the use of the word "lamer" and
prefer to the words "minor group", after all, all of us were once lamers!

To English persons we wish to let it be known that Scousers never (that is, at
no time) use the phrase "it's wicked".

And so ends the Scouse huts contribution to this magnificent magazine... (This
is "Playboy" isn't it?) Perhaps there'll be more... Perhaps not!!!
                                                                The SCG-members


THE REAL BASKET MASTER

A damn cool day we had, visiting DSH and MR.DECIBEL from ORION in the homeland,
called "Holland"... HO!! We first came to DSH, who woz just importin'
"IMPOSSIBLE MISSION 2" via modem and then drove to MR.DECIBEL, who has quite a
comfortable hut. He suggested playing a Baketball match in his garden, between
TRIAD (TK and me) and ORION, so it went on... But MR.DECIBEL was so fair
telling us that he's playing in the Dutch National team... urgh? Not a single
chance remained and we sank with 2:5, (MR.DECIBEL: 4, JS: 2, DSH: 1 and TK:
NONE! lame!). We spent the evening again at DSH'S home, cracking jokes ontha
fone... I hope to repeat this journey soon, eh?
                                                                             JS

Who do the PAPILLONS think they are? "Hey Hey Hey" (trying to imitate FS?) "Why
do you gays in TRIAD are so fucking proud of your Winter Edition?? You know we
released it 2 weeks before!"

THE THING THAT NOT A SINGLE TRIAD MEMBER KNEW ABOUT A VERSION FROM TPI, AND
AFTER CALLING SOMNE GUYS, WHO HAVEN'T HAD THE GAME WORKING, WE DECIDED TO DO
THAT.

ANYWAY, THE WINTER EDITION VERSION FROM THE PAPILLONS SUCKS, IT CRASHES DOWN
EVERY TIME (where woz the Fast Load?) WHAT CAN WE DO IF YOU DO NOT SPREAD YOUR
VERSION, EH?

Have a look at their version of "S.S. SOCCER" and "IMPOSSIBLE MISSION II", the
both crash down. Try to save on S.S. SOCCER or to play IMPOSSIBLE MISSION up to
its end. So, lesbians, come and say that again!!!

The Adventures of
BUGGY DISKHEAD
(*note: this is originally a comic strip*)

Buggy holds a phone handset, makes "thumbs up" and exclaims:
"NOW, NEW SOFT FROM U.S.A. VIA TELEPHONE!"

Buggy smashes the handset into an acoustic couple (ie a modem) connects to a US
board whilst the keyboard makes a hacking noise and the modem beeps in the
background.

Buggy meets his friends:
Buggy: "10 MARKS PER DISK, O.K.?"
Buggys' friends: "TOO MUCH"

Buggy looks depressed.

Friend: "WHY SO MUCH?"

Buggy holds up his phone bill.

Buggy: "IN ORDER TO PAY MY PHONE BILL!"

NEWS FROM THE CRACKERS' WORLD: SYSTEM FOUR

I just changed the title above, it is still the same column, but with other
clothez, you see??? It seems as if the March woz no quiet months! Why?
Because...

* One of Englands' best crackers returned to System Four and showed again their
skill with some cool cracks. I'm talking of SCOUSE CRACKING GROUP, that are
WEETBIX, CHUNK, DR.J and MOG. Other English groups got mighty rivals!

* Firkin, Smash and Gene left ACTUAL CRACKING ENTERTAINMENT, but in difference
from THE SILENTS who joined A.C.E., left it, joined and finally left it, they
built up their own group, named STARS.

* As DSH and MR.DECIBEL told us they kicked DIGITAL SOLUTIONS INC., EURATOM and
SOFTWAR TECHNICS out of ORION to hold the group as small as possible.
Nevertheless there are only a few German members of ORION left and that are
ZENOBITS, who used to be in 7'up.

* Steve of ZENITH is probably the most hated dude in England! Ian of Fusion and
Ironfist co-wrote a game called "Hard Labour" and told Steve that some dudes
wrote it and it was a mega cool game. "Hard Labour" was in fact a very big joke
on Steve coz it's just a demo that slags Steve off.

* IKARI expanded. TRIDOS, kicked out of FUSION coz of recrackin', joined also
as IRONFIST of ZENITH wanted to do but haven't done yet.

* Do you also agree that ACTIVISION are stupid for trying to do "AFTERBURNER"
on 64? What is more stupid is they will also try to do it on Spectrum and
Amstrad.

* JESTER of LAZER CRACKING SERVICE left LCS and joined IKARI. But they are
exclusively trading with THE SURVIVORS in the USA and JESTER also trades with
ATC, so he left and joined nobody less than FUSION, where he and MARK are the
only active guys left on 64, coz IAN changed his SYSTEM... even MITCH from
EAGLESOFT INC. said in his intro (IMPOSSIBLE MISSION 2): "Hey Ian turn that
AMIGA off... now!". Nothing to add.

* About IMPOSSIBLE MISSION 2: Everybody was upset coz quite unknown FREESTYLE
released it on the last Venlo meeting, but everybody must have noticed that it
is only a preview, that took its mysterious way from the German magazine
"Powerplay" to them. Everybody really thought it was the game, but their
version crashes down after some levels, even though they wrote in their intro
"this is the long awaited game". SHARKS released exactly the same version 2
weeks later. Good job, eh? The REAL "IMPOSSIBLE MISSION 2" just made its way
from the USA to Europe and guess what? It is the same loader as in "WINTER
EDITION", so I sent the not working one, imported by DSH / ORION, to the huge
creature of magical forces, better said: JANITOR from TRIAD, so you have to
expect a running version in a couple of seconds.

* Wasn't that the most frustrating incident for Europeans since years? "THE
GAMES: WINTER EDITION" didn't work on European computers, everybody thought
that one has to wait some months until EPYX releases the special European
versions. But they forgot two dudes that fixed it, the first MR.ZEROPAGE / TLC
who fixed it with a self-written load routine and the other one the living dead
JANITOR who fixed the EPYX fast loader. Thanx to them for the working version,
think of all that lamers that have to wait for EPYXS' release. So if you see
any review in any magazines you can be sure right now that those swines also
have our versions. HA! Another victory for SYSTEM FOUR!

* From RUBBERDUCK into RUB and then INSIDE THE BUILDING... NO! This is not a
new group... no! It's a single person! RUB from THE WANDERER GROUP? He is the
one that changed his name into inside the building... no April joke!

* Another bad news for 64 owners, one day after one heard of IAN / FS quitting
64 at the top of the success, STRIDER / FLT also said goodbye to the small
calculator to work on the grown up Amiga, but for how long? So only Gollum is
left on the 64 for FLT.

* FAIRLIGHT just wanted to merge with some FUSION members, but those changed
their minds as STRIDER told me.

* TRIANGLE 3532 are also back on the cracking market after a few weeks peace of
what else? Police. But read Swyxs' article...

* As MAD ALL / CFR told me secretly on a conference, CFR took in 4 members...
guess from which country? I bet you guessed wrong! They're from AUSTRIA and so
unknown that he forgot their names (on purpose?), but it seems as if they are
highly talented...

* Latest news from the SHARKS are that TPI (not PAPILLONS but THE PIRATES INT.)
left 'em and wants to join TRIAD. We (me and Dan) haven't stopped thinking
'bout dat.

* Not 100 percent sure I can tell that IAN and MIC left TRIAD together with the
GRONK, cuz making a legal group producing only Compunet demos. Word spread that
both Ian and Mic went crazy as they got their money for their game: Scout. It
seems as if England has been left from TRIAD members.

* F.A.M.E., who used to be in TRIAD, also LEGAL (as they call it!), improved
their very good sound routine as you can hear in the new "Digital News". They
also got offers from FIREBIRD, ELITE and CASCADE... and read and believe they
probably do the sound for "AFTERBURNER" / Activision!

* Did you think that "FLASHPOINT" and "VICTORY ROAD", both from Ocean, will
soon be released on 64? HA! As Ocean's software manager said it was never
planned to release these games on home computers... The company who made the
ads (Centersoft) only thought that... funny, eh?

- Guess what? That was all for today! Special thanx for those news to: LAZER /
NEW BENCOR BROS, CF / BEASTIE B., DSH and MR.DECIBEL / ORION, FUSION, NIK and
JUST ICE / IKARI, STRIDER / FLT, MAD ALL / CFR, ITB / TWG (!) and GENE / STARS.
Yours forever...
                                                                     Jeff Smart


VIDEO

Who said that cracking and video movies watching does not belong together?
Anyway, we didn't. From now on every month LAZER from NEW BENCOR BROS will
inform you about the latest pirate video released in System Four!

>> NIGHTMARE ON ELM ST. 3 - DREAM WARRIORS
Yep, your old friend (or is it fiend?!) is back again! In Nightmare 3 we have
half a dozen fear-filled teenagers locked in a Top Security mental hospital,
being diagnosed as suicidal. Heather Langenkamp returns as the now grown up
Nancy, who organizes the kids into Dream Warriors to d. battle with Freddy on
his tort. This is much better than the first two, with some cool FX like the
man-eating Television! RATING: 73% Nightmare on Elm St. 4 is being filmed NOW!

>> PREDATOR
Arnold Schwarzenegger returns as major Alan Schaefer, leader of a special unit
sent deep into South America to rescue kidnapped diplomats. Arnold is on top
form as he takes on the guerillas and wiped them all out. But on the way home
an invisible alien takes out every member of his team until only he and a
captured girl remain... Well, you must be lame if you don't know the rest of
the story! All I can say about this is "BRILLIANT"! RATING: 92%

>> FULL METAL JACKET
Yes! Yet another fucking Vietnam movie! The story follows a bunch of raw
recruits through their training and into the Nam, watched closely by the marine
sergeant! Now what was the tune again? Oh yes: "If I die on the Russian front,
bury me with Russian cunt!" RATING: 85%

AMIGA
AMIGA - CHAT'S

As many of the 64 freaks also own an Amiga, and many of Amiga owners also
searched for Amiga games reviews in the "ILLEGAL", here are some short reviews
of some Amiga stuff, that has been released this month.

SECONDS OUT:
Looks nice at the beginning but after some hours of playing it's getting
boring. RATING: 6 / 100.

JUMPJET:
Jumpjet, the simulator, is about the same as on the 64 compared with the
possibilities of both machines. The handling is a bit difficult, on the other
hand it serves you some rather good features. It isn't that worse game on the
64, but there is still much left for being a top-hit, 71 / 100.

BLASTABALL:
Mastertronic produced better games on the Amiga (look at Kikstart II) but also
this one is a bit better as Mastertronics' first products. The future sport
featured in this game looses a bit of its' fun after more times playing, 29 /
100.

BMX SIMULATOR:
A long time for waiting passed by until the first Amiga game from Code Masters
is released, but it could have been a better conversion of this 64 game as
there are no big differences. Nevertheless the game is not that bad and it
earns 72 / 100.

SIDEWINDER:
Anoter Mastertronic Program, at first I got a bit shocked cos of the flickering
screen, but it seems to be one of the best shoot 'em ups on the Amiga, 90 /
100.

BUBBLE BOBBLE:
The Amiga scene gets attacked with so many 64 games, some of 'em are not much
different from the old 64 version, one of 'em is Bubble Bobble which you can
also load on a 64 with the same effects, 42 / 100.

STRIKE FORCE HARRIER:
Quite a good conversion of the ST game, even though it's quite difficult to
control, 82 / 100.

PINK PANTHER:
It's rather hard to find the aim of that well looking game, nice grafix and
sounds make it get a 87 / 100.

BONE CRUNCHER:
Again a 64 conversion with great graphics, but one knows the game already from
the 64, 83 / 100.

At last I have to say don't worry when disagreeing with my opinion! I tried to
make objective reviews, but it's obvious that there are some who believe in the
opposite. Thanks!
                                                                 SSD / TSK-CREW


CHANGING GROUP AND NAME?

Hey, wake up! What makes you feeling better after having changed group and
name? That seems to be popular in the last months (especially in Germany).
BEASTIE BOYS, SHARKS and THE WANDERER GROUP ad older examples and ONLINE,
DEVILS and UPFRONT shows that there is no end of it. Of course all of you think
of the success with for example FUSION or ORION had had after such an
activation.

The opposite of this is proved by FAC, HOTLINE and TRIAD which are high at the
rankings as in the last end three years. We also played with the idea of
changing our name (TSK-CREW into MOUNTAINEERS, sounds funny, eh?) but after all
we all voted to keep our present name. The case was that we thought of all the
changings which also would have drawn by our friends and contacts. Guess, in
half a year there have all big groups changed their names, nobody knows of the
good old names. A legend will never exist anymore!

Another point of view is that lots of freaks change their groups, they leave
the first group then join the second, afterwards join the third crew and after
all go back to group one. Comrades, you have to understand that your crew will
only succeed when keeping the same name and members.

It makes us a lot frustrated to hear every day: X and Y of A and B have founded
a new group called YABX. I know there are differences between agreeing and
disagreeing to this statements (also in my deeper minds) but make your own
thoughts of it, says...
                                                                 SSD / TSK-CREW


No, methinks that why not changing the group when you can improve your grade of
being known? Why not building up a new group when you think you better start
with something totally new, maybe because of having made some mistakes cuz of
some reason? Why not kicking out some members for recracking, lazyness or
whatever? Methinks that this is a fine characteristic of the whole cracking
scene, that we call System Four.

Won't that be too boring if there are only always the same and old groups? Of
course why changing one's name when you have such a reputation that you don't
want to give it up ever, that's true and only a few did that, I want to add
RADWAR, EAGLESOFT INC., CFR, FAIRLIGHT who all exist for quite a lot of years
now and why should they give up their name?

Hope to hear other points of view, I'm waiting for yours...
yours...
                                                                         Jeffie


MUSIC MAESTRO'S
MANIACS OF NOISE

To every active owner of a C 64 the MANIACS OF NOISE are no strangers. For some
time they have brightened up the scene in the demoworld and on compunet with
their magnificent music in always excellent and original demos.

The ever increasing quality of their brainchildren have led to some lucrative
deals with some big names in the software market. At Venlo I was lucky enough
to bump into CHARLES DEENEN, the guy who wrote the music routine on which all
the maniacs' music is written by Marcel 'MAD' Donne' and Jeroen 'JT' Tel. After
much debating he gave me an exclusive for "ILLEGAL". I obtained the previews of
some music they wrote for forthcoming games and I can tell you that they are
breathtaking but unfortunately I can't give 'em out otherwise the people might
get into trouble, but to be complete here is a list of the music they finished
or are finishing soon:

For HEWSON: Battle Valley, Cybernoid, Top Trucker + Chromethunder by JT.
     Scorpion by MAD
For MARTECH: Vixen by JT
For THALAMUS: Hawkeye by JT
For MASTERTRONIC: Scout and Gaplus by JT
For PLAYERS: Starballs by JT
For STARLIGHT: Alloyrun by JT

Most sound fx on these games were made by Charles Deenen and Marcel Donne', who
is also doing the music for THE LAST WARRIOR. So if all you stumbeling
programmers out there need a hand then read what they asked "ILLEGAL" to print:

If you're writing a game and you need high quality professional music and fx
let us do it and your game will be a success, write for orders to:

COPS 'N CRACKERS

Hi dudes. SWYX of TRIANGLE here!!! Now the headline sounds like a bad imitation
of "cops n' robbers" or a movie in one of system four's cinemas, but it
definately is not!!! I named this article "Cops 'n crackers", cus the cops and
a Danish organisation called S.U.S. seriously are hunting us crackers in
Denmark now!

The whole thing started about a month ago, when a guy named "Goodfather" (by
the way, he was a member of one of my former groups, Danish Cracking Crew) got
busted. Well, the only bad thing about him getting busted was that he is a
lousy coward! Wha'd'ya think the guy promised? Yeah, he promised to help the
police catching all the big and known groups in Denmark!

Thanks, pal!

Unfortunately, Goodfather had more than 300 adresses in his archive, including
mine, of course. So... I paniced! The same night, I started removing all my
disks, adresses and tape copies etc., and so did all the other Triangle
members. In the next 14 days, 3-5 other guys got busted. The only well-known
one was The Tiger of Dexion, who is just on the Amiga!

Last week then, I returned all my equipment to its place and Triangle started
cracking and trading again! We thought that the danger was over, until today
(5th of April), when I just heard that Azake of System had been busted! Scratch
of the triangular gang called him, to ask if it was true or not and it sure
was! Well, the guy admitted that it was right be his own fault that he got
busted, cuz he sold some games to a S.U.S. guy a few days ago. That's all I
know about that case here, I just wish that it'll be over soon. And now... An
announcement:

ON THE FIRST OF MAY, TRIANGLE WILL BE ONE YEAR OLD!! WE WOULD LIKE TO RECEIVE
BIRTHDAY-CARDS / CALLS FROM EVERYBODY, EVEN THOSE OF YOU WE DON'T TRADE WITH.
EVERYONE, WHO SENDS A POSTCARD OR CALL US, WILL BE SPECIAL GREETED IN THE
BIRTHDAY - DEMO, BUT REMEMBER WE MUST HAVE 'EM BEFORE 1ST OF MAY (ADRESS ON
LAST PAGE) !!!!

Remember to look out for the first TRIANGLE / TRIAD cooperation, which is a
demo made by COZMIX and JANITOR, the living deads!

Well, before leaving you, just a few greetings to:

- TRIAD (JS, IXION, JANITOR and HI-TEC)
- HEPTAGON, SCIENCE 451 (THE BRIGHT LION), I.O.F. and the NICE GUYS in
Triangle.

See ya in issue #28

THE STORY OF SYSTEM FOUR

While you look at HER, you suddenly notice that you have to leave at the next
bus stop, so you stand up and press the button that makes the bus stop.
Surprise, surprise, SHE also stands up and want to leave, together with this
lame friend of hers (you guessed that he wasn't a 'f-class' guy) to your
dissapointment. Anyway, you found out that SHE is goin to the same school as
you do. You recognize an old friend of yours and begin to talk to him. You lost
HER out of your eyes, but you couldn't keep your minds away from her. Isn't
that a shame? You, as one of the few 'a-class' guys is ruled by a girl? By a
SINGLE girl?

Anyway, you are still thinking about HER as you leave school after 6 boring
lessons, you walk home and do the work for your business. You turned the radio
on and heard sum exciting news: "It was heard outta System Four that several
guys were kicked outta it, cuz of vandalism and negative outward apperance!".
HA! you thought, it's totally new that they keep an eye on your outward
appearance. Anyway it's not bad, you guessed that you knew those lamers that
had to say: Goodbye. You took a look on your watch and you scared 'cause it was
almost 6 o'clock and the meeting of the 5 biggest classes, that are 'a' up to
'e', should begin at 6 o'clock. You took your clothes and left to the meeting
place.

You meet all your friends from your group that is the most established in the
FOUR. Sumtimes when you lay back you can't believe that you entered this group,
it's incredible when you see those other 50.000 groups that do exist after all.
You drank sum beers with your friends, of course the 'a'-class guys have a
seperated room from the others. Everybody's watching out for them, but they
couldn't notice the few that have all rights. You heard that some changes are
about to come, because sum went over to 'System 16' and now there are only
THREE groups ruling. And at the same time you catched the word that another
group is about to be kicked down from 'a' to 'b'. Stunning, stunning, what can
happen? Anyway, another great thing is that the leader of the group also
changed to 'system 16', but sum members of 'em still remained in 'system four',
it seems that only the biggest can survive.

You talk with your friends about taking in sum new members, news and anything
else as sum decided to take a secret visit to 'snatchos', the girl's town. You,
though you were scared, cuz you've never been there before, agree to go with
them. You take a back seat in the fluffy car with your 4 friends and after you
entered the nearest bar in 'snatchos' you relax a little bit with your 3rd
bottle beer in your hand. You feel the heat growing up, you sing to the music,
sit down with your friends in a corner and talked... as the door swinged
open... and SHE entered alone, you almost forgot her. TO BE CONTINUED
                                                                            /JS


WOSSUP???

Ahhh! I can't wait until the 16th of April for the April Venlo Party. You know
who's coming? IKARI, FUSION, FAIRLIGHT, TRIAD, HOTLINE, RWE, BEASTIE BOYS, TWG,
ORION, CFR and all the others that are normally there! Ut seems as if that
would be an ultimate party and we here in Germany used a little trick to
persuade even the guys that are coming from very far away (FUSION - TRIAD) to
come to Venlo, but more about that in the next issue... cuz it's a secret!

This month was quite surprising with super releases from the American companies
EPYX and CINEMAWARE that increase the hopes for a hot summer. Anyway, before
returning to SYSTEM FOUR, I send, as usual, a couple of greetings to my best
friends that, that inlude: JESTER of FUSION (cum), JUST ICE from IKARI WARRIORS
+, STRIDER + GOLLAME (sorry Fred, it woz Toni's idea), Badd Boyy from THE
SURVIVORS (old Kookmeyer!), CF from BEASTIE BOYS, DSH and MISTER DECIBEL of
ONION, ha, ORION, of course, my dude SWYX from the TRIANGULAR GANG (take care),
LAZER from NEW BENCORS (thanx 4 da magz), MWS of RADWAR (Mike's escapes part
two?), GENE from ze STARS (best action 4 years?), SLEDGE from HOTLINE, SPC and
INSIGHT ZEBOILDONG from THE WANDERER GROUP, MAD ALLIGATOR of CFR (beware of
lamers' revenge...), ACU / SAP, FOTT OHNE NY, JAYS, UNKNOW and as special
"Wossup?" to BERNIE in Canada!, all from TRANSCOM, THE MIND SLAYER of THE
AWESOME GUYZ (still imprisoned?), DOMINATORS, PAPILLIONS, JEWELS - the 3 from
Denmark, ABYSS (Longshot), EAGLESOFT, FBR, WEETBIX from SCOUSE CRACKING GROUP
(so sorry for mentioning ya so late, Georgie!), THE MANAGEMENT (Tom, cold
callz), MR.ZEROPAGE and SSD of TSK-CREW.

And now special thanx for keepin the "ILLEGAL" alive: ALEX of REDLINE 97 (go
on!), HOBBIT / FAIRLIGHT (hope 2 meet U, Allain), NY / TRANSCOM (thanx for
copying..), TENZET / TRIANGLE (thanx mate) and all other SUB EDITORS from the
different countries. Super Special Hellos to all members of TRIAD, especially
to:

The zombie dat found his way outta the black forest 'n who's now standing in
front of the gate of the huge castle showing his authorization for entering
(You know who I mean?), the guy who's not only counting the rankings together,
but takes care of everything (clear eh?), the guy who celebrated his 18th
birthday not at home, but I guess eventhough it was wet, wasn't it (something
like MISS PINGY?), the master of the colours who said: "Hooray" after being
back from boring Spain (Pay or flee?), the blond young guy, prefering this
Swine football team (Dingens...) and last F.A.M.E. (THE TAPE!). See you at
Venlo, yours:
                                                                         Jeffie

Welcome to the darkest article of yer favourite magazine, this is dedicated to
two people who decided to quit the computer world alltogether. Maybe not for
ever but certainly for a very long time, everybody already know about them but
this way I and the rest of "ILLEGAL" salute them.

- The first one is, the ever-popular JANITOR of TRIAD. Already when he was in
RELAX he showed great promise, as the weeks passed he got better and it was
soon obvious that was no normal cracker, he made the shortest version of games,
with sometimes even adding a copy-chain to it, at the time, the only versions
that were slightly better were those of TCS. His talent must have caught the
eyes of TRIAD, who after the departure of MR.Z were struggling to get good
versions out, cuz TRIAD incorporated RELAX and the rest is as they say HISTORY.
MR.Z became his mentor and Janitor began not only to make the shortest versions
but he also removed all the bugs that were original in the game. Due to his
talent OUTRUN among other games became a little bit fun to play. Just think
about it, OUTRUN has just reached the stage of best selling game ever on the 64
but only we, the pirates, have a full working version thanks to, yes, JANITOR.

- The second loss for the pirate world this month was MR.VENLO himself, THE
SILVER SURFER (TSS) of HOTLINE. Always a familiar face at copyparties (he was
in fact the first guy I ever spoke to at Venlo) and a true HOTLINE member with
heart and soul. He will always be remembered as the guy who wrote all those
magnificent intros on all those HTL cracks and trainers (which he did himself).
For ever a year for ever a year now a had been in HOTLINE, but before that he
drifted from group to group, some of which were: ABA-SOFT, ISG, THE GOONIES,
THE WAVE, TCC 1777 and HCS 5005, but of the latter he admits that it was the
biggest mistake in his life. Soon after that he joined HOTLINE and stayed there
until now. The main reason for him to drop out is that his exams (finals) are
coming up real soon so he has to study very hard coz one can't expect to stay
an intro-maker for the rest of his life. His last work on the Commodore 64 was
of course an intro, ironically not for his group HOTLINE, but for
COMMANDOFRONTIER (sounds familiar!) and for that I will be remembering him for
a very long time...

THERE COMES A TIME WHEN THE FINAL CURTAIN FALLS, WHEN HEROES LEAVE THE BATTLE
OF HIGHER GOALS FOR THESE TWO THAT TIME HAS COME... They are surely not
forgotten, and will never be.
                                                                  MAD ALL / CFR
