               Produced by The Fanatic Duo, Radwar / TLC + CFR!


HELLO, DUDES!

It's again English time! Our foreign contacts were really glad when they
received their 'ILLEGAL' with some English information in it. So I decided to
continue writing some notes in English and to enlarge this part a bit. So
you'll find three pages with only English words on it. O.K., let's start:

The main event in December for all German is the FCS Copyparty on the 5th of
December 1987. Fantasy from FCS told me that the following people announce
their visit: POPEYE / HOTLINE, F4CG, TAU, HULK + MALARIA, DOMINATORS,
PAPILLONS, FAC, LAST SCIENCE and of course the German elite. What'll happen
there? When you hold this 'ILLEGAL' in your hands the party's already over,
'cause I decided to release it there. If you understand German a bit, read the
article 'Vorschau: FCS' and you can guess what'll be going on there.

Can you believe that some guys don't know what a 'telephone-conference' is? But
it's true that some people never heard of it before. For us, a conference is a
usual part of having friends in America, I think. At this place I want to send
some special greetinx to our conference guys, e.g.: BARNIE and GEORGE 'no gays
allowed, thank you' from CANADA, CHRIS and DAVE of TWGI in the States, MAD ALL
from CFR in 'little Belgium', NIK and MARK from IKARI, GEORGE 'also a black
dick' of SCOUSE, SLH from HOTLINE, (who holds the record with 4 conferences a
day), ROB 'the real Rob' from BB and all girls (who always talk toooo much).
It's impossible for someone, who had never heard of a conference, to imagine
that up to 20 (our record) people can talk at the same time, isn't it? You are
a poor pig, if you have never took part in a conference. Hear out for it!

Of course another great event this month will definately be the TRIAD -
FAIRLIGHT copyparty from the 18th to the 21st December in Gothenburg / Sweden.
But it's a question if many people will come, 'cause Sweden is too far out of
bounds from Germany, Holland, Belgium and so on. Denmark was the most central
place and will ever be I think, but let's wait for the results from Sweden's
best (and only?) groups!


INTERVIEW ON THE MONTH!
THIS TIME: MAD ALL / CFR

It's a great pleasure for us to interview MAD ALL, in his person the founder of
the COMMANDOFRONTIER. Read what he answered to our 10 questions!

JS: How old are you?

MA: Almost 20 (Shit - I'm old!)

JS: What computers do you own?

MA: 1st: ATARI ST   (December '82)
    2nd: TI         (December '83)
    3rd: C 64       (December '84)
    4th one: Amiga  (September '87)

JS: The founding date of CFR?

MA: I started CFR on 1/1/87!!!

JS: What were your first products?

MA: 1st crack: SHAOLIN'S ROAD (2/87)
    1st demo:  by Anubis + Lord Blitter in January '87!

JS: How many members does CFR have at the moment?

MA: All together they're 7! Black Label (22 years), Ram (18), Bubuland (18),
Dakota (17), Stef (18), The Jew (18) and me. All in Belgium. By the way, Human
(15) in Norway is starting his own group...

JS: How many contacts do ya have?

MA: We manouvered it down from 150 to 75. I personally have about 20 cool guys
on my list!

JS: Which game and which music do you love?

MA: My favourite game is INTERNATIONAL SOCCER and my music is ROCK and HEAVY
METAL (e.g. Iron Maiden, Van Halen, ZZ Top, Def Leppard etc.) And my TOP 3
movies are:
            1. Blues Brothers
            2. Animal House
            3. Highlander

JS: Do you have some enemies in this rough world?

MA: We have no war with anybody and never had, although our name let something
different be supposed we are a people lovin group.

JS: What's going on with CFR?

MA: A sad thing: CFR will probably quit on the 64 as I'm the only member still
interested in the old 64. All our programmers have switched over to the Amiga,
but I will continue to trade on both machines. We have decided to give a last
to computer mass on the 64: We will make a mega demo called "The final" which
will be 'bout 1000 blocks long (200 K), so watch for it.

JS: What do you do in your freetime?

MA: When I'm not in front of a computer, I'm in front of a woman or on top or
underneath. Oh yeah, I go to parties a lot!

You see CFR haven't died yet! In the next 'ILLEGAL' you can read an interview
with RADWAR / TLC!


SPEAK ENGLISH OR DIE!!!

O.K. let's return into the mother language of the real crackers: in German (bad
joke!).

Do you have your own copy of 'Western Games'? The idea from RADWAR was great to
send it only to faithful friends (thanx for your faith), but there was a lack
in the U.S.A., where the version was spread like hell. FAC and MCG imported it
back from the States and spread like idiots in the rest of the world. RWE #1,
FAC #0, MCG #0, the others #1!

Right below this, you can find the 'Riddle of the month' and I hope you enjoy
it. You can also find the dogs, eh sorry, the docs for it right below here.
Good luck for your mission!

The game of the month, if not of the whole year is, without doubts, 'COMBAT
SCHOOL' from OCEAN, who can really programme, if they want to. I suppose that
Ocean employs Drill instructors, who forced them to make such a great game. It
can be compared with the old 'Decathlon' or 'Hyper Sports' but it's much
better.

'WESTERN GAMES' from MAGIC BYTES had wounderful graphics, but unfortunately the
joystick movements are too difficult. 'INTERNATIONAL KARATE +' from SYSTEM 3
has raised the expectations for the forthcoming legend 'BANGKOK KNIGHTS',
'cause it's a horny and superb game! But there were also shadows between the
lights of good games, e.g. CLEVER AND SMART from MAGIC BYTES, which is much too
difficult to play. What a shame for that great name! RAMPARTS from GO! is also
too difficult and disappointing. What's the aim of that fucking rubbish called
'BASIL' from GREMLIN? The graphics are quite good, but I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO
DO!?

So much to the games from that month. Detailed reviews in German language
available on the other pages, 'cause I used a lot of German expressions, which
are too difficult to translate! I hope you excuse it! This was it for now and
maybe I'm gonna put the next 'ILLEGAL' totally into English. What do you (yes,
you) think 'bout that? Here's my adress for any kind of criticism:

RIDDLE!

Here are the docs for the 'Riddle of the month': Search for the 27 cracker
groups among this labyrinth of letters. They can be found forwards, up, down,
backwards and even diagonal!

If you have found all 27 groups, check the characters, which are left. Print
them down from left-top up to right-bottom and then you found the solution.
Just try it! Good luck and Shoot 'em Up!

WHAT'S UP, GUYS?

I bet your dicks are up, aren't they? As in every month, I'm thinking about the
release date for the 'ILLEGAL 1/88', and what is better than the first
copyparty in the new year? You know, it's RADWAR's one, who celebrate their
existence for now over 2 years and the party will be, as usual for RWE,
something special. It will take its place on the 9th of January 1988 and it's
the best chance to release the next 'ILLEGAL' isn't it? In the issue 'Die Post
- Dien Freund und Helfer!?' we interviewed a German postman, because it was
necessary to get to know why the post is so angry at the moment. They always
want to see the passport of a 'PLK' owner, when they want to get their
packages, so read what the post says.

Wanna laugh? Read 'Amiga 500 Presentation' and 'Wie fliegt man schnell aus
einem Kaufhaus?' about our chaotic ideas and happenings at our largest shopping
center, where we cracked some jokes with the presentator of an Amiga 500, who
was official sended by Commodore and who presented some cracks on the Amiga as
the exciting games and where we made the shop assistant crazy by laughing on
the small kids on the computers and so on.

'New games approaching' contains an actual list of American products which
should make their way from the States to Europe as soon as possible (thanx to
SLH / HOTLINE for this list). And don't miss the game reviews and all the
charts.

Special fuckings are going to D.S.I. from FAC (Why could FAC take such idiots?)
for the attempt of stealing MAD ALL from CFR for their mugging of an own
magazine.

I never said that I was the first, who produced a cracker magazine, of course
it was DR.MABUSE with his 'SCHROTTPRESSE', but the 'ILLEGAL' is much different,
in my opinion. Hey, DR.M.! Where have you gone? But now, lots of arseholes are
stealing my ideas, and I DON'T LIKE IT AT ALL (OF COURSE)...

SPECIAL GREETINGS TO: BEASTIE BOYS (Accept and CF) - faster than the speed of
light - HOTLINE (Sledgehammer and Popeye), SCOUSE CRACKING GROUP (Weetbix), DCU
(Jayce, nice phone call), RADWAR (BKA, MWS, AVH + TC), CFR (MAD ALL), TRIANGLE
(SWYX, our brothers?), TRIAD (MR.PINGE, very nice letter), FCS (FANTASY + TSM),
SAP (masked ACU), TWG (RUB!), IKARI (PAL, NIK and JUST ICE), FAIRLIGHT
(FREDRIK), RSI (MZP), TWR 1881 / SRG (RENEGADE), SCA (S.T.S.P.), THE SHARKS
(TPI and MCL), CO3 (BARNIE, coolest conferences), TSK-CREW (SSD), KGB CREW,
YANKEE, TAU, THE PAPILLONS, BRK, all members of TWGI, NEW IMPORTS and all
friends. With best wishes.
                                                              JEFF SMART / TFD!

MAD ALL'S MAILBOX

Hi! I'm MAD ALL from COMMANDOFRONTIER and each month I will take care of all
the gossip about the pirating scene, so if you have any gossip about you, your
group or any other group, please let me know immediately at this adress:

                               COMMANDOFRONTIER
                                  PO BOX 406
                                 8400 OOSTENDE
                                    BELGIUM

BUT please don't use this column for fighting out your personal wars so don't
send me lies or bad things about your enemies. Well, it's gossip time, sorry
for only bringing you a small amount this month, but I had to get it all
myself, so hopefully you, the reader, will help me out!

- TRIAD have now a staggering 22 members, but I was assured that all non active
members will be kicked out.

- HUMAN has left CFR and joined two EX-RDI members to form his own group, the
name is of yet unknown, meanwhile CFR have replaced him with an unknown guy,
who seems to be talented enough. Hopes are high but CFR will still be as good
for demos as before? Only time will tell.

- HOTLINE will stop going to the Venlo meetings in Holland. They say that they
always bring the new stuff and have to travel a long way. From now on they will
hold their own copy-party a bit closer to their homes in Eindhoven.

- By the way, IKARI have promised to come over from England to the next Venlo
meeting in December. We're waiting.

- On the 5th of December, the day on which the FCS party will take place in the
capital of Germany, is a celebration day in Holland, thus lots of Dutch people
cannot come.

- It seems that HOTLINE have some war at the moment with MAD SQUAD (Ex-
Dreamteam).

- OUTRUN will be released two weeks before christmas, if one can believe US
GOLD.

- USSPE from AMERICA have joined forces with the TSK-CREW in Austria.

- Lots of 'ILLEGAL' - imitations make their way among the cracking scene, but
they are all a cheap copy of the 'ILLEGAL'.

- Well that's it for this month, so get your hot gossip to me so I can really
fill this column up. I WISH YOU A HAPPY CHRISTMAS AND A HAPPY NEW YEAR!
                                                          Yours...MAD ALL / CFR
