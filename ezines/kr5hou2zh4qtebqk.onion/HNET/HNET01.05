JANET (the Joint Academic NETwork) is a favourite hacking tool for newcomers to 
hacking - mainly because it and the computers attached to it offer you so much 
help and information which can be used to do nice things with their micros! 
 
Hey ho and here we go! 
 
The first thing that you need to do is to find a telephone access number for 
the JANET pad nearest to you.  To help you do this please refer to file #6, in 
this issue of H-Net which is Hackernet BBS's latest list of such numbers and in 
some cases gives the baud rates which have been tested out on these pads. 
 
When you have found the telephone number that you need then set your comms 
terminal to seven bits, even parity with one stop bit (7e1).  Then dial the 
telephone number (a baudrate of 2400 is sometimes catered for - but is 
unreliable on some pads).  When you get the CONNECT message press your <RETURN> 
key a couple of times, if nothing happens then wait about 4 seconds then press 
the <RETURN> key two or three times again.  You should now get a 'welcome' 
message (on some PADS you might now get the prompt 'Which Service?' type 'PAD' 
<RETURN>) the ypu will get a system prompt (e.g. 'PAD>'). If you do not get 
such a prompt then drop the line and reconfigure your comms s/w (you might have 
to do this a few times until you work out the proper settings as all pads do 
not work on a uniform setting - unfortunately! - but it's all good hacking 
experience anyway - trying to work out the proper settings for the target 
system. 
 
When you have the 'PAD>' or a similar prompt then type the following command:- 
 
PAD> logon f,r 
 
the pad isn't really all that fussy about what you use after the 'logon' 
command, 'f,r' is just an example - in practise you could use anything, most 
people use 'x,x' for some reasonh...please note that on some pads that you 
might have to type 'login' instead of 'logon'. 
 
What does this command do?  Well it tells the JANET Pad that when you have 
called through to one of the computers connected to it's network - done your 
business then exited from that computer that you want to return to the 'PAD>' 
prompt so that you can 'CALL' other computers on the network.  If you do not 
enter this command your line will be dropped when you have exited from the 
first computer on the network that you have called - and that would mean having 
to redial the pad again....yawn! 
 
The next command to get to grips with is the 'CALL' command.  This along with a 
NETWORK ADDRESS allows you to connect to other computers on the JANET network. 
In file #7 in this issue of H-Net you will find a list of some of the computers 
that you can connect to on the JANET network along with their NETWORK address 
and/or their NETWORK mnemonic. 
 
The way to use the 'CALL' command is as follows :- firstly, find the NETWORK 
ADDRESS of the computer that you wish to connect to (in this example the 
Unaxcess chatboard at Bradford University which is 0000121100 ), then type the 
following at the 'PAD>' prompt :- 
 
PAD> call j.0000121100 
 

The 'j.' just tells the pad to expect a JANET address.  Please note that some 
PAD managers have gotten wise to hackers using their PADs to gain access to 
systems on the JANET network, in these cases they might have changed the format 
of the 'CALL' command around a little bit - usually by making it so that the 
'.' after the 'j' in the above example is no longer required - on such systems 
the 'CALL' command should be :- 
 
PAD> call j0000121100 
 
On some PADs there is on online help facility - to make use of this just type:- 
 
PAD> help 
 
you should get a response similar to this :- 
 
Help knows about :- 
 
ADDRESS TARIFFS STATUS 
 
The address helpfile is usually quite useful - to get this type :- 
 
PAD> help address 
 
then a nice list of network mnemonics available from that PAD might start 
scrolling down your screen.  Mnemonics can be used instead of the NETWORK 
ADDRESSES previously mentioned.  For instance if we wanted to call the 
Lancaster Universities' PD software computer system use the following call 
command :- 
 
PAD> call lancs.pdsoft 
 
It is just a nice way to be able to access the systems on the network as they 
cannot expect the average student or lecturer to remember the 10 or 14 digit 
NETWORK ADDRESSES which prevail on the JANET system! 
 
When you have entered your 'CALL' command you should get a response such as 
'connecting..' if you just get garbage then you might need to change the 
configuration of your terminal.  For instance if you call the pad using 7e1 
then when you call an address and just get garbage then quickly switch to 8n1 
and press return once - you should then get some sense out of the computer that 
you have requested access to (usually a 'login:' or similar prompt). If this 
does not work then keep on changing your settings until you do get in.
 
From here on in it will be just like calling the target computer direct, except 
that when you exit from the computer you will be returned to the 'PAD>' prompt 
again (if you remembered to enter your 'logon' command!), again - if you just 
get garbage after terminating your session on a computer on the JANET network 
then you will need to reset the configuration of your comms s/w / terminal to 
what it originally was when you first called the PAD. 
 
Well, that just about sums it up I guess - this should be all you need to know 
about using the JANET system and pads - the little quirks it has and so on. The 
best thing about JANET in my eyes is that (usually for the price of a local 
call) you can get into computers all over the world, belonging to mainly 
educational establishments but also defence and other organisations!  The main 
type of computers that you will find on JANET are VAX, UNIX and PRIME with a 
splattering of other systems here and there. 
 
I hope that this file has been of help to you - if you have any new information 
about JANET in general or some of the systems available through it then please 
e-mail me 'WEAZLE' on the Hackernet BBS.
