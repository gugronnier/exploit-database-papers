Are you looking for a friendly, orignal BBS with plenty of hacking info?

Then stop looking because you are reading H-Net Magazine which is produced
by the sysop and users of the HACKERNET BBS in England!

If you like what you have seen in this issue of H-Net magazine then why not
try out the bbs from where it originates?

Hackernet BBS phone number : [LEEDS,UK(0532) 557739] 24 hrs, up to 2400 baud!
 
Hackernet BBS has 2 hacking sigs.  The first one is called Hackernet and is
sig 2.  This is the low-access hacking area and is where most of the hacking
info gets posted.  There are well over 100 hacking files in this sig and plenty
of messages.

The other hacking sig is called Hackers Hideout and is sig 12. This is the high
level hacking area and needless to say that this is where all the *HOT* info
gets posted! There are over 120 hacking files in this area!

We have also just started a sig which deals with the whole spectrum of elec-
tronics - getting started, building and designing circuits, specialist projects
etc.etc.

To get access to the Hackernet (low-level) you will have to e-mail 'BAUDERLINE'
with some hacking info that currently works. * Not stuff from Hackers Handbook
or phone numbers without ID's or Passwords please!*  This info will be validated
then you either will or will not get access to this sig,

To get access to Hackers Hideout (high-access) you have to have been a contri-
buting member of the low-level hacking sig for a few months at least.

Access to the Electronics sig will be upon request.

To get access to download privileges on the Hackernet BBS you will have to 
upload 1 *one* file first, I DO NOT want any trougher's on the BBS!

Hackernet BBS also caters for all the popular computers with some pretty wicked
ST & IBM sigs and a growing AMIGA section!

Hackernet BBS was started on the 17th of June 1989, we have over 8000 messages
and more than 1050 downloads online.

So go on - give us a call and upload something for the next issue of H-Net
magazine!

[ 65 megs of phun!, just a phone call away! ]
