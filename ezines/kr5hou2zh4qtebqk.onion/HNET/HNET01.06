JANET PAD listing - revision 1.2 - 1st March 1990 
 
To start you off, two excellent public-access systems exist on JANET that are 
CRAMMED with info and useful clues for would-be hackers! 
 
These are:       
 
JANET News Machine: 000050005002 (login as 'NEWS' - no password needed) 
 
NISS Bulletin Board:000062200000  
 
These two systems will give you plenty of starting points for possible hacks 
(net addresses etc). But make sure that you're on a local call if possible 
-before I found these PAD numbers, I spent 3 hours on a long-distance call to 
the Janet News Machine!!! Hope this info is of use and interest - leave a msg 
for 'Boris' on Hackernet BBS if you have questions/comments/suggestions/good 
passwords!! One more thing - try calling 000002010001 - this is a PD software 
archive run by Lancaster Uni. - they carry s/w for PC, ST, Amiga, BBC and (I 
think) other machines as well. Eventually I'll put up a file on here going 
intomore detail...(by the way, you'll need to login with username 'pdsoft' and 
password 'pdsoft' - both in lower case) Bye for now, and have great fun - I 
did! Cheers, Boz

                 UPDATES WITH THIS REVISION (1.3): 
  
Added Leeds Uni's PAD (0532-461514). 
Changed the line format slightly to squeeze in more comments. 
Changed the format of the introductory notes to make them more readable (!) 
Changed all London 01 codes to the new 071/081 format. 
 
REVISION 1.2 (1 Mar '90) 
 
Another name change - to JPADxx.TXT.  
Hopefully this is easier to type - and leaves me a bit of room for extending 
the filename if necessary! 
ULCC's V23 node (071-831-6181) is actually 8-N-1 and not 7-E-1 as listed in 
previous revisions.  
The PAD's which I have actually tested and found to work OK are now markedwith 
asterisks (*). 
 
REVISION 1.1 (18th Feb '90) 
 
Lancaster Uni's PAD actually uses 8 bits, no parity, one stop bit instead of 
7-E-1! Apologies for the error...No more mistakes detected so far...! Cheers, 
Boz.
