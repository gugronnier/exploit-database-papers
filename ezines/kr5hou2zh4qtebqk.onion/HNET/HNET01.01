Welcome to the first issue of the H-Net textfile hacking magazine!

H-Net magazine is absolutely free of charge and can be freely distributed on 
the condition that all the files that constitute each magazine should remain 
together and not be altered or split.  Although H-Net is free I would like to 
receive contributions from readers to keep the magazine alive, you can do this 
by uploading files in Ascii or ARC format to Hackernet BBS in England - details
of which are given at the top of this file and periodically throughout the 
magazine.  Alternativeley you can send any articles on disk (5 1/4 or 3 1/2 inch
disks) again in Ascii or ARC (PC or ST) format to the address at the bottom of 
this file.  Thank you.
