Welcome to the first issue of the H-Net textfile hacking magazine!
 
H-Net magazine comes to you from the Hackernet BBS in England - Telephone 
[LEEDS,UK](0532 557739), speeds available from 300 to 2400 baud.  

Who is H-Net intended for? 

Hackers and Phreakers from all over the world - from beginners to out and out 
experts. 
 
What sort of articles will H-Net have?  

Anything and everything to do with hacking and phreaking.  Obviously this 
magazine will only survive by getting contributions from it's readers - so in 
effect the subjects discussed in H-Net will depend to a large extent on the 
content of the contributions received.  Especially welcome are Hackers Guides 
to different types of systems which have not been previously covered and also 
log files of hacks or articles of hacking news from around the world (arrests 
etc.etc.). 
 
H-Net magazine is absolutely free of charge and can be freely distributed on 
the condition that all the files that constitute each magazine should remain 
together and not be altered or split.  Although H-Net is free I would like to 
receive contributions from readers to keep the magazine alive, you can do this 
by uploading files in Ascii or ARC format to Hackernet BBS in England - details 
of which are given at the top of this file and periodically throughout the 
magazine.  Alternativeley you can send any articles/files on disk (5 1/4 or 3 
1/2 inch disks) again in Ascii or ARC format to the address at the bottom of 
this file. 

H-Net Hackers Scruples :-

Dont destroy or alter files or data.
Dont 'dump' a system - anybody can do that, but it's usually a loser that does! 

I hope that you enjoy H-Net and that we can produce further issues together!!
