UNAXCESS is a bbs that is run by Bradford University on the JANET (Joint
Academic) NETwork.  Although it is very strictly run and you need to be a 
student to gain access I did not find it much of a problem.  They also have
a strict policy of no hacking chat - but with UNIX and VAX help conferences
I was still interested in it!! hehehe.  Another interesting feature of the BBS
is it's chat mode 'T' from the main menu - about 8 lines I think.

Plenty of people seem to be slagging off JANET as boring these days - they are 
usually the people who havent bothered to have a good look around - I mean
the La Palma Observatory hack was quite funny!! hehee

Yes. To make a new one, you need to "cd /usr/wcw; ./mkmflp"

Subject: changing directory in a c program

The whole idea of changing the directory in a c program is so that
I can write for example
        chdir("/user/compsci/cs_bsc/evansmp/application");
                ...
        output = fopen("outfile");
        input = fopen("infile");
        rename ("infile","infile%");

without having to put the complete path name in every file reference,
and ensuring that the program will do what it should do whatever the
pwd of its parent process is.

Prehaps more useful is
        #define APPLICATION_DIR "/usr/compsci/cs_bsc/evansmp/application"
                ...
        chdir(APPLICATION_DIR);

Try this

if [ -f file ]
then
        mkdir /tmp/mysignon/whatever
fi

Or, if the file has to both exist and be non-zero in length
use

if [ -s file ]

Square brackets execute the command test, I think the above is more
readable, but you can also write these as below (see test manual page)

hmm.. I think you're kinda getting mixed up over the way subshells exist in
unix if you're talking like that...  there's no way in unix that a child
process can set the enviromnet (or anything else) of its parent (see `man tset`
for a quote like "if a process could set the environment of its parent, none of
this nonsense would be necessary in the first place")

whoever it was said about 'alias a alias' making all the lines using the alias
'a' go back to the start of the file -- uh, nono; the alias has been set up in
the shell process, hash tables and all that jazz; it doesnt need to go back
read the file in again.  How could it re-read stdin, eh?

there's various things that make .cshrc initialisation slow;  I can't remember
all the reasons I realised and cut down on in my .cshrc...
evaluating ~<username> is very slow, but ~ on its own is fast.
in tcsh, whenever you set path, it recreates its hash table (maybe in csh too)
so don't do
set path = ( /bin /usr/bin /usr/ucb /usr/local /gnu/bin )
set path = ( $path ~/bin/sun3 ~/bin/scripts /cs/share/bin )
set path = ( $path /more/funky/stuff /loadsa/paths/for/interesting/things )
... do it all in one line, escaping newlines.
also, if your path setup uses eg ../bin/`arch`/ or something several times, or
indeed if you use any program more than once to get the same result, evaluate
it once and put it in a variable.
keep checking it and cutting out anything you dont really use; I for one often
make up wierd and wonderful aliases to do complex tasks without needing any
further thought (what's that?) and then never use them again.
Put all the esoteric ones in a separate file and make an alias (gasp!) to

Ssh startup is LOADS faster than csh, because you can get it to
declare aliases as extern, i.e. expanded when called the first time.
Means you can have as many wierd aliases as you like.

Doesnt help with csh though, does it..

Setting paths, i find it best to do it like thius..

set lpath = ( ~/bin /usr/local/bin ~/bin/X11 )
set path = ( . $lpath /usr/bin /usr/ucb /bin /etc /usr/etc )

Except thatI usually put . at the end

Also, if you replace less common aliases with scripts, startup is faster.

What I meant was to simulate alias with shell scripts . It tends to be a lot
more flexible than the brain-dead alias facilities of csh. Trouble is then
theres the delay of spawning another shell :-(

If you make teh first line of your script

#!\bin\csh -f

(slashes should be forward ones, but that key isnt workking :-( )

It shouldd start csh without reading aliases etc, check the manual page
for csh options.

Better still, write your scripts in Bournne shell, as its smaller it'll
start faster - and for scripts its generally regarded as a better shell.

For Bourne shell startup use

#!\bin\sh

Okay, speaking as a dedicated VMS person, I'm probably the wrong person to
answer this, but here goes!!  One of the earliest shells was the Bourne shell
(written by Bourne), which should be found in /bin (i.e. /bin/sh).  This is the
standard shell (well, sort of).  It is small, fast and limited (no command
recall, line editing or sttff like that).  Next on the scene was the C shell
(/bin/csh)  this is meant to have a c-like syntax, making it easy for C
programmers to write shell scripts.  It has rudimentary line-editing, using
commands like !! to recall the previous command !a to recal the last command
st`rting with a and various more complicated stuff.  A recent arrival (ish) is
the korn shell (/bin/ksh) this is big but offers lots of facilities.  There is
line-editing using EMACS or vi keystrokes.  Aliases are available in csh and
ksh, these enable you to alias (for example) x to be cat, so when you type x
the shell replaces it with cat which it then executes.  That's an overview ...
the logout approaches!!

There's also one I've heard of called `ash', which is intended to run with
`atty' (an `alternative termininal driver', which does line-editing etc.).

Bash (the FSF's Bourne Again Shell) is sort of a greatest upper bound (!) of
/bin/sh and csh - it has a superset of sh syntax, line-editing a la emacs, and
csh's job control and history substitution.

I've also heard of tcsh, which is sort of a modified csh (as ksh is a modified
Bourne shell).

I think that's more than enough, don't you? :)

while developing the socket-using program (and it's really getting hair-raising

dropping the socket you were using.  Where I'm at the (Sequent Symmetry S29 I
