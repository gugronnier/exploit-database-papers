FTR [ Free Text Retrieval System]  [SIGNET/help/0065458inf/ftr]

FTR  makes  searching  for  random items of  information  much  faster  than 
previous methods.   A search taking half an hour is a very long time  indeed 
by  computer  standards.   The use of such time on a large  system  such  as 
SIGNET is also costly.

To  make searching a database more efficient,  more than one element may  be 
indexed.  

FTR takes an alternative approach.   Suppose,  for example,  that we want to 
perform a search on unstructered data like the text in this file.  Free text 
retrieval  can do that for us.   A newpaper article - or thousands of  other 
potential  data  sources like it - could be fed  into  a  database,  without 
predefining  any  structure or context for the  data  concerned,  and  every 
substantive  word of every record would be indexed.   So every occurence  of 
any  data  item - whether it be in a newspaper report,  a  criminal  records 
file,  a report from an informant,  the electoral register - can rapidly  be 
located.   The characteristic of free text storage is that there is no  need 
to  define in advance what data will be entered or to define  any  structure 
within which the given data will appear.

Because every significant word (other than common words like 'the',  'of' or 
'for')  in  the  SIGNET  FTR database is indexed  unless  the  user  chooses 
otherwise,  a  lot  of extra space is required.   Instead  of,  say,  one  5 
gigabyte disc store,  we should probably need three,  for the same amount of 
basic data stored.   The SIGNET computers' processor also has to be  larger, 
since as well as answering the terminal operators enquiries,  it would  have 
to  maintain  the  many indexes,  keeping them up to date as  new  data  was 
entered,  deleted,  amended  or moved around the storage system.   For  this 
reason,  the  extra  expense of operating an FTR system can only be  met  by 
organisations  - such as SIGNET - who expect many of their enquiries of  the 
database to be of the unstructured, unpredictable kind.

Another aspect of FTR is the ability to provide a dictionary,  thesaurus  or 
'concordance' of equivalent or similar terms or phrases.   Different  people 
entering  data into the system may use different terms or  descriptions  for 
the  same  attribute - for example,  by describing eye colour  variously  as 
'blue-grey',  'grey' or 'blue-green';  or light brown hair as 'fair' or just 
'brown'.   Such  a  dictionary system will also make an allowance  for  such 
things as phonetically equivalent or near-equivalent names - for example, by 
treating Smythe,  Smith,  Smiths and Schmitt as the same when searching  the 
database.   The SIGNET computer uses a particularly extensive system of this 
kind,  called Soundex, when searching its criminal names or 'marked persons' 
indexes.

When  making an enquiry of the SIGNET FTR database the usual practice is  to 
specify various words, names or attributes, and the ways in which they might 
occur together.   The separate paragraphs of this text file form some of the 
many records in the SIGNET database which usesd FTR.   An Operative  arrives 
with  news  that a reliable informant has phoned to say that  a  man  called 
Young and,  of all people,  a vicar or a priest, whose name is unknown, plan 
to murder a man known as Sandy.   Typed on the VDU screen, the enquiry could 
look something like this :

     FIND : Young + [vicar,priest] + Sandy

This  is  an instruction to the FTR software to look for  any  record  which 
contains the name Young, refers to a vicar or a priest and to someone called 
Sandy.  There is no point in looking at everybody called Young - there would 
be too many.   But someone who is called Young and who is associated with  a 
priest  or  a vicar and with a man called Sandy,  might be a very  good  bet 
indeed.

The SIGNET FTR system should search and reply within twelve seconds.

Other FTR systems which can be accessed via SIGNET :

STATUS  -  Met. Special Branch & 'C Department'.
IVAN    -  Home Office (immigration service).
CEDRIC  -  Customs and Excise.

Also, of course, PNC, the Police National Computer.

ADDENDUM :

The  power of computers to handle and analyse large quantities  of  personal 
data  was  - until recently - constrained by technical  limitations  on  the 
absorption of information.  Printed information, such as a magazine article, 
was not 'machine-readable'.  Until recently this meant that a human operator 
had  to  enter  information into  the  computer's  memory  store.   Database 
operators can now feed a magazine,  newspaper or ordinary typed report  page 
by  page  into  a  scanner;  the computer 'reads'  the  page  using  optical 
character recognition (OCR), no further typing is needed.
