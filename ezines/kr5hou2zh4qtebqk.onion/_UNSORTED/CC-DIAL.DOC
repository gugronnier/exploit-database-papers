  1. Introduction:
  ----------------
        The CC-Dialer is  a Utility, which was primarily programmed for the
 use  by  myself, but as I think this tool is rather useful, I want to give 
 every-one the chance of using it. This Programm is primarily for the Trans-
 fer  of the Phone and Card Number, when you have reached the ANSWERING MA-
 CHINE  of AT&T  for example, but it can also be used as a Dialer for Pulse 
 Systems.

 2. The Package:
 ---------------
        The Package CC-DIAL.ZIP was scanned for Virusses with the McAFFEE      
 V108, and for Validation, You now have the exact File lengths:

        cc-dial.exe  13088 Bytes
        cc-dial.doc   7244 Bytes

 3. Legal Stuff:
 ---------------
        THE  USE OF THIS  PROGRAM IS  AT OWN RISK, WHICH MEANS THAT I DO NOT
 TAKE RESPONSIBILITY FOR ANY SOFT OR HARDWARE FAILURE DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY
 CAUSED BY THIS PROGRAM ! 

 *NOTE* But as I use this program myself, you can be sure that it is NOT in-
 tendet to do any harm to anything connectd to the computer !

 4. The Use:
 -----------
        The Version 1.00á is held rather simple, but still powerful enough to
 perform  any  of my desiered  actions at a adequate speed. When you start up
 the  Dialer, you can  also give the Parameters for a Terminal Program, which
 you will then be able to start from within the Dialer.

        When  CC-DIAL  starts up, it  will test the location of the modem, at 
 the serial ports COM1 and COM2 (as i only have 2 Serials, i couldn't test it 
 with 4 Serials ). When no Modem is found (Modem turned off ???), the Program
 will  conclude  in  a immediate HALT. When a Modem is found You will get the
 "CODE: "-Prompt,  where  you  can enter a password, immportant for the later
 explained  SECURITY-Feature  of  CC-DIAL. After that you can enter the Phone
 and the Cardnumber you want to use.

        At  this  time the Dialer is ready to work, you will now just have to 
 call  the  Operator, and when the Answering Machine starts you press "P", to
 X-fer  the  Phone-number  you  want to call, after the Number is dialed, you 
 press  "SPACE"  to  instruct the Modem to hang up. (MAKE SURE YOU HAVE STILL
 THE  PHONE  PICKED  UP, OTHERWISE THE LINE WILL BE GONE !!!)... ;-) ... when
 you  are  instructed  to  enter  the  Cardnumber, you press "C",and the same 
 happens  with  the  Cardnumber.  Then you  can press "SPACE" again, and then
 choose  the  Terminal ("T") option, to  Jump  immediately to a Terminal Pro-
 gram  (If you've defined one, in the Command line!).  There press "ATD", and
 ya are ONLINE !!! ;-)

 5. The Options:
 ---------------
 >>> P     : X-fer da Phone Number
        When You've reached the Operator, You can press the "P"-Key to trans-
 fer the Phone Number you have entered.

 >>> C     : X-fer da Card Number 
        "C" will transfer the Card-number specified.

 >>> Alt-P : Punch in new Phone Number 
        Specify new Phone number to be dialed.

 >>> Alt-C : Punch in new Card Number  
        Specify new Calling Card number to be used.

 >>> Alt-T : Set DTMF Duration Time    
        If the Answering machine doesn't get the Phone number right, because 
 you're too fast, you can specify a new Value for the S37 Register. (Normally
 50 ms is OK)

 >>> D     : Toggle Tone/Pulse Dialing 
        You can toggle between Pulse and Tone Dialing, thus you can also use
 the Dialer as your Telephone Memory (NOT TOO INTERESING YET, as I didn't
 program an Phone and Card book for the Version 1.00á, but it will hopefully
 follow soon !!!!).

 >>> V     : Toggle Speaker Volume     
        If ya want to hear what the Operator says while the Modem in OFF HOOK
 you can hear toggle the "L"-Command of the Modem.

 >>> T     : Jump ta Terminal          
        You can specify a Terminal to be called by the Dialer, when ya start
 CC-Dial with Parameters. As I'm using Telix here a little example:

        CC-DIAL.EXE TELIX.EXE /CCARD.CNF
 
 You can also give ONE parameter to the terminal, which is, as ya can see the
 SECOND Parameter given to CC-DIAL. In Card.CNF I defined that ATD is send 
 immediately after MODEM init, but still in the MODEM-INIT-STRING.

 NOTE: MAKE SURE THE DIALER IS IN THE SAME DIRACTORY AS YOUR TERMINAL, OR YOU
 CALL THE DIALER FROM YOUR TERMINAL'S DIRECTORY, OTHERWISE THERE WILL OCCURR
 PROBLEMS WITH LOCATING THE KEY FILES OF THE TERMINAL !!!

 (* At least TELIX has these Problems ..... *)

 >>> S     : Security ON/OFF           
        When ya don't want other to see you Card number, you can here Switch
 if it is displayed or not. When you toggle Security from ON to OFF you will
 have to punch in the CODEWORD specified at the Start of the Program.

 >>> SPACE : Crunch Line !             
        Just sends a "ATH" to the Modem, for example to go ON HOOK after you
 have dialed the whole Phone number..

 >>> Alt-X : Rip Dialer outa Memory    
        If ya're fed up with this Program, and just want to get out !! ;-)

6. EXAMPLE:
-----------
        To give ya an idea of what to do with this Program here an Example:
 1. CC-DIAL <Here Your Terminal Program> <Here the Terminal Parameter>
 2. Type your Codeword
 3. Punch in the Phone number you want to dial
 4. Punch in your Card Number
 5. Pick up Phone an Dial the Operator Number
 6. When You are told to transfer the Phone Number press "P"
 7. After the Number is Dialed completely press "SPACE"
 8. Wait for accustic Signal, then Press "C"
 9. After the Number is Dialed completely press "SPACE" again
 10. Press "T" to enter the terminal Program

 8. BUGS:
 --------
        THIS PROGRAM MIGHT STILL HAVE BUGS, THUS THIS IS ONLY THE BETA TEST
 VERSION !!!! A FULL RELEASE WILL FOLLOW AFTER I HAVE TESTED IT TROUGHLY !!

 9. LATER ADDITIONS:
 -------------------
        Here some of my "ILLUSIONS", of what I want to add to the DIALER..

 - PHONE & CARD Directory where Numbers can be stored.
 - CONFIG FILE, where several things are stored (e.g. TERMINAL PRORAM)
 - DOSSHELL in addition to the TERMINAL Option
 - Code-Optimizing to speed up the whole stuff

 -------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Oh well, as you've now reached the End of FILE, the only thing I can do is
 to whish ya fun with this little Prog of mine ;-)

 Ciao then,

 OUTLAW
