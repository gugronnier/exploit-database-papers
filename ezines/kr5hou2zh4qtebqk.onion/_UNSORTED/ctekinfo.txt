		 Cellular Telephone Experimentors Kit
		        for the OKI-900/1150

The Cellular Telephone Experimentors Kit allows control of a cellular
telephone from a personal computer.  The Kit connects any DOS-based PC
with a serial port to an OKI-900/1150 (AT&T 3730/3760) cellular telephone.
The kit is designed for technicians, students, professionals, hobbyists,
and others interested in using, learning, repairing, and experimenting
with cellular telephone technology.

The kit consists of an interface adapter, software and manual.  The
interface adapter converts the cellular phone's proprietary interface to a
standard RS-232 interface, and allows connection of external audio signals
to the cellular phone.  The interface is not designed for data transmission
over the cellular system.

The kit includes the cellular telephone interface adapter;  a manual and a
short cellular tutorial;  four programs;  a programming library and
documentation;  and cellular related informational files.

One program is designed for testing the phone and allows a technician to
activate many of the OKIs built in test modes and functions, such as tuning
to a particular channel, activating carrier, sat, signalling tones, etc.

Another program can be used to access the phone's user features, such as
programming NAMs, or uploading, downloading and editing the phone's 200
alphanumeric telephone number memories on the PC.

A programming library object module is supplied to allow you to write your
own programs to access the phone in both normal operating mode and in test
mode.  The library contains functions such as tuning to a channel, turning
carrier/audio/sat-tones/signalling-tones on and off, reading received
signal strength, sending and receiving digital control messages, and
sending and decoding dtmf tones.

Two programs are supplied in source form that give examples of writing
applications in either of these modes.  One of these programs shows how the
PC can completely control the cellular phone, making and receiving calls
while the phone is only operating in its test mode, with the PC handling
all of the cellular protocol and messaging functions.  The other program
simply controls the phone by simulating presses on its keypad from the PC.

All code and libraries were compiled using Borland Turbo C 2.0 running
under DOS.  We are not supporting any other systems at this time.
The software does not change or modify ESNs.


OTHER CELLULAR PHONES AND PRODUCTS

We do not support any other brand of cellular telephones.  We also do
consulting and special projects with OKI related cellular equipment.
