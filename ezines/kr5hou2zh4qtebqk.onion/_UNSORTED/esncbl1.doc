 Well HTH is working on the designs so you guys can also do your Flip Phones
in this same manner, which will not require you to open the phone!! Since
my days are limited I hope I can get it out to you guys before I go in. If 
not then you should just contact any HTH member on The New York Hack Exchange
 Now if you understand how the whole reprogramming process works you'll
know that you can not reprogram phones with software version higher than
9122 now as for the flip and the brick phones you can uses that 'Trick Clip'
that HTH sells or you can pay more an get from that SPY SUPPLY GUY, now that
'TRICK CLIP' allows you to reprogram phones with software above 9122, with
the old software provided that you open the phone, now that is also the 
same process if you were to reprogram a bag phone with higher software you
would need to get another EPROM that has old firmware programmed into it,
and that aslo requires you to open the phone. Now this ESN changer cable will
allow you to change the ESN of a MOTOROLA Bag phone with out opening it,
provided that you already have one bag phone that has the old program in it.
 Now what this will allow you to do is take you old bag phone and run the
Motorola software on it, and change it to the ESN that you wish to place on
another phone. Now what you will be doing is placing the the ESN TRANSFER
Cable on you rphone and the one you wish to change. And follow the 
instructions below.

 Now here is the set up for the ESN TRANSFER CABLE I'll make a better
Diagram later on so look out for it.

 Now check this out...


     From your unit                 to the phone you want to program
     --------------                 --------------------------------
         12                                      12
          8                                     4 & 5
         17                                       3
         18                                       18

 Those are you PIN arrangements for the bag phones...Now this will not work
 on software versions 61c97 and 61H15.

  Fail Codes for ESN Transfer:
   FAIL   Incorrect setup or defective equipment
   FAIL 2 No ESN in your unit
   FAIL 12 Bad transfer phone. (The phone that your trying to put a new ESN
             on is fucked up)


   INSTRUCTION ON ESN TRANSFER:

 Step 1. Connect the cable with no power applied.
 Step 2. Press the "PWR" key to turn on the UNITs. Press "#66#" to begin
         the transfer. The hand set will display "66" while the transfer is
         taking place and the "66" will be replaced by "PASS" OR "FAIL"
         WHEN IT IS FINISHED ABOVE IS THE LIST OF fail CODES.
 Step 3. If the phones both say "pass" then thats it you pull it off now 
         just check the phone by pressing 38# in test mode to check to make 
         sure the new ESN is in there. 

 Thats it, if you have any questions just contact myself or anyother HTH 
 member on THE NEW YORK HACK EXCHANGE BBS (718) 379-4702. If you need the 
 old program to place in  a new phone we also have it!!

     Thats it for now when we get anything else new we will release it!!
       LATER ,
