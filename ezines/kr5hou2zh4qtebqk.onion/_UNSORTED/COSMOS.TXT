  I have seen many philes written on
COSMOS in which all they did was to
Copy the information out of a COSMOS
manual they found while trashing. This
tutorial will have some information
from the manual, but mainly was writ
ten using information of first-hand
experience while on the system.

------
COSMOS- COMPUTERIZED SYSTEM FOR
------  MAINFRAME OPERATIONS.

COSMOS, is a wire center administration
system for subscriber services. Or put
another way: an inter-office memo 
sender. Its primary objectives are:
 
1)To relieve the problems of congestion
  and long cross connection on the Main
  Distributing Frame (MFD).
 
2)To improve entity load balance and
  customer line equipment distribution
  accross the WireCenters switching
  equipment.

3)To provide an accurate and readily
  accessible data base for use by all
  AT&T departments.

4)The Loop Assigment Office (LAC) uses 
  it to generate orders for RAM use.

Each Telco has it's own COSMOS system
usually one in each Area Code.
 
CAPABILITIES:
-------------

COSMOS is POWER with it you can
find out alot of info such as:

Give COSMOS a number and it will tell
you who it's billed to, who its listed
under, what types of service they have
(touch tone, rotary, flat rate etc.).

If a person changes thier fone number
you can find out what it was changed
to.

You can find out numbers by giving
COSMOS thier name, even unpublished
phone numbers!


RISKS:
------

Once unauthorized logins are detected,
the COSMOS phone number(s) will be
changed immediatly! It0 no big deal
for them to change the number, they
just send out a letter to thier
offices saying it's change0. But
they probably throw away those papers
and you will be able to find alot of
interesting inpho by trashing.
Also, most or all calls to COSMOS are
traced, or the number has ANI equip
ment hooked up to it, so be creful!


IDENTIFICATION:
---------------

COSMOS logins and proceedures vary
from area to area, Some ask for
just the login and password without
a WireCenter, others require it.
The phollowing information is based
on Southern Bell's COSMOS system.

To Identify a COSMOS system after
connecting you will see:

;LOGIN:
PASSWORD:
WC?

The ;LOGIN: is the username, which
usually consists of two letters and
two numbers ie: PA52. Sometimes NAME:
is substituted for, or is required
with ;LOGIN: again it depends on what
system you are on. Next it will ask
for the PASSWORD: which depending on
the system, has different formats for
passwords. Some make a little sense
like BASE52 while others may be eight
random characters. Last thing you will
see is the WireCenter. A WireCenter
is usually an abbreviation of the city
that it covers. Such as OA for OAkland
or PP for Pembroke Pines, in any case
it is two letters. The WireCenter will
cover a certain amount of prefixes.
And you will not be able to look up
other phone #'s unless the prefixes
are in the specific WireCenter.  The
promt for cosmos is the WireCenter and
a % sign.  IE: WC% where WC is the Wire
Center you are logged in as.  If you
do happen to get ahold of a login and
password, but the system still asks
for a WireCenter, then you can tell
what are valid WireCenters by when it
asks for login & password, then the
WireCenter and you enter a wrong WC
the system will respond with:

;LOGIN: PA52
PASSWORD:
WC?XX
WC??
INVALID LOGIN

If you noticed, WC?? came after the
WireCenter, now if you had a valid
WC, it would just say INVALID LOGIN
after the WC without the WC??.  IE:

;LOGIN:PA52
PASSWORD:
WC?OA
INVALID LOGIN

That would mean you have the correct
WC, but incorrect password.  If all
goes well you will get OA% as the
promt for whatever your WC is.

TRANSACTION CODES
----------- -----

COSMOS has a set of three letter
commands called Transaction Codes
which tell the system what to do. They
enable you to view, modify, or add
information about telephone numbers,
class of service, Operating Exchanges,
etc.

Here is a brief description of the
most commonly used Transaction codes:

CAY - Create an Assembly
CCA - Change Customer Attributes
DAY - Delete an Assembly
DRE - Deny and Restore Establishment
FLR - Frame Layout Report
ISH - Inquire about a Ciruit <-phone #
LOE - List Originating line Equipment
MAL - Manual Assignment List
MAY - Modify An Assebly
MCH - Manually Change Hunt
MDC - Manually Disconnect a Ciruit
SCA - Service Order Complection - Auto
SIR - Sorting Inquiry by Range
SLC - Subscriber Line Counts for
      Custom Calling Features
USL - List USOC (US) File Data
WCC - Wire Center Change

Here's an example of a trsaction,
using ISH (Inquire about a circuit)
which gives information about a
telephone number.

WC% ISH
H TN 935-2481


It will then print various information
about the phone # 935-2481.  But it is
doubtful you will understand since it
is all abbreviated.  I will explain
everything in Part II.  After printing
the info about the #, COSMOS will say:
** ISH Completed 20-JUN-84 **

When using certain commands, there are
various lines to be used.  Some are:
H-Line --Required in most transactions
for order, inquiry, and report data.
I-Line --Transaction involves inward
movement (ie: installing a phone).
O-Line --Transaction involves outware
movement (ie: disconnecting a phone).
R-Line -- Used for makin0 remarks to
service or work orders.  A H-Line was
used in this example.
To signify the end of input for most
commands type "." w/out quotes.  You
use a ";" to separate ciruits, which
is good when you (or the phone co.)
has to enter massive amounts of info.


PREFIXES, FORMATS AND CODE VALUES:
--------- ------- --- ---- -------

COSMOS provides a language by means
of which the user can communicate with
the system.  The language includes
various prefixes as well as input
formats and input values.

PREFIXES are abbreviations which
represent specific data categories to
the system when input by the user. An
example of a prefix is "TN" which means
"Telephone Number".  An input format
defines the number of characters
following a prefix as well as the
pattern in which these must be entered
For example, "TN XXX-XXXX" means that
the prefix "TN" must be followed by
even characters in the format shown.

INPUT VALUES are the allowable data
entered for each prefix in the correct
input format.  As mentioned in the
previous paragraph, the input format
for the prefix "TN" IS "TN XXX-XXXX".
The first three characters (XXX) must
be alphanumeric; the last four (XXXX)
must be numeric.  So, COSMOS would
consider an input of "TN 935-2481" as
valid input.  But ou *must* use the
correct WireCenter for the (XXX) in
question.  In HACKING COSMOS PART II
I will have a list of the most
commonly used prefixes, formats and
prefix code values which enable you
to read and understand COSMOS
Transactions.


COSNIX
------

COSNIX is a mutated version of COSMOS
and UNIX both written by Bell Labs.
COSNIX, is the operating system of
the COSMOS system.

SYSTEM COMMANDS
------ --------

As some of you will notice,if you read
the basics of Hacking II- VAX's UNIX,
by The Knights Of Shadow, alot of the
commands used on UNIX are also used
on COSMOS.

Commands are as phollows:

WHERE - gives location of the system:
        this command can be $VERY$
        useful since you can go
        TRASHING at the location
        that the center is at.

WC% WHERE

COSMOS 5 <- or whatever # it is.
street address
city, state zip

WHAT - tells what version of COSNIX
       the system is running on.

WC% WHAT

COSNIX operating system 9.2.3 release
December 7,1983
14.2.2
March 1,1984


Just like on a UNIX, to see who els
is on the system type:

WC% WHO

COM3            TT00              GB
FW56            TT04              HH
PA52            TT12              PZ
FC55            TT14              OA
R052            TT15              PZ

In the first column is the username,
the nex is thier tt#, and last is
the WireCenter.

To see what files are in the directory
you are logged in on, type:

WC% LS

To see *All* files you have access to:

WC% LS /*

Files and Paths will be explained in
detail in PARTS II, III.

DATE - Simply gives the Date

TTY

WC% TTY<-Will give you the TeleTypwriter
         number you logged on as.

Using Control-C will Interupt any
process you are executing at the time.
Sometimes you will have to enter it
more than once. Ctrl-S pauses Ctrl-Q
restarts and Ctrl-Y logs you off.

Thats it for PART I, it should give
you a basic understanding of COSMOS.
Part II will explain the prefixes so
you will be able to interpret alot of
the information printed by COSMOS.
And will explain paths/files.
