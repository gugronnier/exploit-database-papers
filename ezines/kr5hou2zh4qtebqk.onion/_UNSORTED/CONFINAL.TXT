SUPER MAGIC DRIVE, SUPER MAGICOM copiers            00:58  SATURDAY  28-DEC-91
========================================

                  \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\
                   > Q U E S T I O N S  &  A N S W E R S >
                  ///////////////////////////////////////

A  lot  of  people have been asking me lots of questions on ordering the above
copiers...

First  off, the units are LEGAL to buy!  I'm not sure what the situation is on
you  USING  them..   however  that  doesn't  matter as we all know you are not
intending  to  USE  the  copiers, just to have them in your prized collection,
aren't you?  Well..  I hope so!!!

The  prices  given  are  what  they cost YOU!  I can't offer huge discounts to
anyone  for "special reasons" as, with import duty (Customs take my profit) my
margins  are cut by 28-30% (depending on the TW$-US$ rate).  If you think that
is  bulls**t,  call CUSTOMS & EXCISE and ask them yourselves how much they add
on COMPUTER HARDWARE!  - Exactly!

I  have  also  been  asked  by  people  if  I  can supply the copiers with the
"internal  `sysop'  mode" allowing you to create the custom tracks that make a
normal  HD  disk  a MEGADRIVE/FAMICOM compatible disk.  We are licensed agents
and  only  have  the ONE machine of each ourselves (Pray it doesn't f**k up!).
It  is  not  extra  software but a special modified ROM on the main board.  So
please don't ask, unless you are taking up to 50 and are a computer dealer!!

 ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
 **UPDATE 10/2/92 - NO LONGER REQUIRE SPECIAL TRACKS**YOU CAN USE ANY DISK!**

There  are  10 HIGH DENSITY disks enclosed.  You can buy more disks from us at
competitive  rates,  and  they  come in proper plastic cases, in 10's and with
labels.

You  can  also  of  course use LOW density disks.  However, one 8 megabit game
would  normally  fit  on a HD disk, and then allow a 4 megabit game too!  With
2DD  you  get  JUST  ONE  8  megabit game on TWO disks!!

(Revised  on 14th January 1992 by Executioner, from original text file sent to

   ** ULTRA REVISION ON 10TH FEBRUARY 1992 ** NOW MIXED WITH COPIERS.TXT **

 INTRODUCTION
 ~~~~~~~~~~~~

The  video game piracy has begun!  Boards all over the world are now realising
that there is more to life than Amiga crap and PC shit!

There   are  now  boards  for  YOUR  console...   Super  Famicom/NES...   Sega
Megadrive/Genesis...  and PC Engine/Turbo Express/Super Grafx!


 THE BOARDS
 ~~~~~~~~~~

14TH JANUARY BOARD UPDATE   --   Who's new on the console scene!
=========================

     S.S.M.S.  Its an Alpha Flight board again but it runs in Germany not in
               the USA.. There is only an Amiga Section and a great new conf
               called `SUPER NiNTENDO / FAMiKOM'... Run by SAiNTZ...
               Call it on +49 303-339471 (ALPHA FLIGHT)

     ULTRABOX  This one is one of the biggest and oldest Crack Houses
               in Germany.. It is run by ULTRA and you will find there is a
               Amiga conference and again a great Console Conference...
               Start calling it now on +49 303-943531. (INDEPENDANT)

     WORLD OF  On this bbs you can order The Super Magic Drive in the USA
       MIRAGE  and start to trade files! +1 718-898-8421 (INDEPENDANT)

 TOXIC INSULT  An indy BBS in search of quality users for support. It's
               console conference is open and files should be pouring
               in real soon! Call it on +1 203-327-4104 (INDEPENDANT)


BOARD ALREADY GOING
===================

     ULTIMATE  The first board to start the console scene off! Supporting the
        DREAM  Super Magic Drive, Super Magicom & Magic Super Griffin. It is
               also the main board to order the hardware, offering payment
               by credit card, cheque or bank transfer. Orders can be posted
               or FAXed. Full details on +44 (0)222 495919. (INDEPENDANT)

     TREASURE  This board has been down for some months. The sysop,
       ISLAND  Executioner is now using Ultimate Dream (see above) to take
      - Up on  orders for the copiers. It should hopefully be up again at the
     Feb 20th  end of the month and will probably be dominated by console
               software (with Amiga files). +44 (0)992 451191 (INDEPENDANT)

        GHOST  Running currently for I.C.S. This board offers files for the
               Megadrive, Super Famicom and PC-Engine, whereas most only offer
               files for the Megadrive and/or Famicom. So if you have a PC-
               Engine or Core Grafx and would like about 225 games.. well
               this is the board to call!

                    (see copiers.txt file above this one!)


KILLING THE RUMOURS
===================

There  have been people going around saying that the Super Magic Drive is crap
because  it does not offer compatibility with other copiers.  Infact no copier
is compatible with any other copier..  there is no reason to be.

However  any  copier  that  saves the game out as an image file is most likely
able  to  have  a coversion program coded to make the file a Magic Drive, Game
Doctor or Super Mega Twin etc..  compatible file.  (This is being looked at)

##############################################################################
** NEWSFLASH ** THERE IS NOW A CONVERTER FILE FOR GAME DOCTOR--MAGIC DRIVE! **
** SOON TO BE UPGRADED FOR MAGICOM AND PC-ENGINE FILES. ALSO CONV TO BINARY **
##############################################################################

Rumours  have been stating that the Magic Drive is not upgradeable..  Erm, not
correct.   DOS  3.1 (and soon 3.2) is supplied on ROM, but you can boot in any
ROM  via disk.  The latest DOS allows you to format 1.6meg disks, which allows
1  8mbit game & 1 4mbit game..  or 6 2mbit games on ONE DISK!  No other copier
allows  this!  Some only allow 1 game per disk, regardless of size!  LAME!  On
the Famicom copier (and others soon..  probably by the time you read this) you
even have a built in disk copy function, that copies ANY format disk!

You  can expand the RAM to 16mbit, which is more than enough to cater for some
new  generation  12mbit  games.   No 16mbit games exist, and probably wont for
some  time  to  come.  **FAMICOM** Street Fighter II is the first game 16Mbit,
and our copier will do it!

The main reason these rumours were started is because some boards only support
their  copier (quite understandibly), and so want everyone to buy THAT device.
After  all,  if  everybody  purchases the Super Magic Drive (and Magicom/Magic
Super  Griffin)  then  they  will  lose out.  However it is not fair to spread
false  stories  which will confuse people a great deal when the scene is being
born.   **UPDATE**  now  with conversion programs becoming available hopefully
things will be better now.

We  will  not  be  spreading  false  stories about the other copiers, but only
stating  the  facts  about our own.  We let YOU decide what to purchase.  Just
remember  though, before you purchase a copier, that what you buy will be what
you will then have to use - think of it as a new computer..  you don't want it
becoming obselete.
