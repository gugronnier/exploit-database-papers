Abstract:
    Disgruntled or dishonest employees are emerging as big threats to corporate
    computer systems because they are more adept at misusing the systems than
    outside hackers. Some companies that have been victimized by in-house
    computer frauds report losses of more than $1 million, in addition to the
    cost of repair and disrupted operations. Even more devastating is a 'logic
    bomb', a program that can be timed to crash a system or plant a virus that
    can destroy data. Among the more notable cases of in-house computer frauds
    are that of AT&T's London office, where three employees were able to funnel
    company funds to themselves; General Dynamics Corp, where a disgruntled
    employee attempted to sabotage a program that was used for building
    missiles; and Charles Schwab and Co, where some employees used the
    company's computer system to trade cocaine.

Abstract:
    An increasing number of computer hackers are engaging in illegal or
    destructive activities. Two of the largest and most famous hacker groups,
    the Legion of Doom and the Masters of Deception (MOD), have broken into
    private networks and stolen or altered records pertaining to credit
    histories, telephone bills and corporate data. Hackers in the early 1980s
    explored computer networks and endorsed the right to search anywhere they
    could as long as they did not alter or abuse the information they acquired.
    Some recent hackers have sold information they found and have engaged in
    competitive battles to see which hacker group could infiltrate the most
    complex system. The MOD and Legion of Doom have participated in duels in
    the past few years. The MOD is made up of a racial diversity that is very
    different from the hacker groups in the 1980s.

      Pub Type:  Company Profile.

Abstract:
    Autodesk Inc, the world's sixth largest microcomputer software company, is
    an unusual company that has been described as a 'theocracy of hackers.' Its
    reclusive founder, John Walker, who gave up management of the firm in 1986
    to resume programming, is as eccentric as his Core members, his elite group
    of programmers. Walker and Core members are unpredictable, given to
    outbursts displayed through 'flame mail,' the stinging electronic messages
    they send one another and other executives. Walker is unconventional,
    giving outside programmer Michael Riddle an unusually generous $10-million
    royalty for his AutoCad software which became Autodesk's hit product.
    Walker, who still holds less than four percent or about 869,000 shares of
    the company, valued at $30 million, returned to company management in 1992
    as technology manager for three months to help select a new CEO. In April
    1992, Carol Bartz was named the new chairperson and CEO. Income and sales
    from 1986 to 1990 did not seem affected by the internal conflicts. They
    rose about five-fold, although not as good as the earlier years when
    earnings would sometimes grow ten-fold over a certain period. But in 4th
    qtr FY 1991, earnings dropped about 25 percent below targets. Autodesk's
    future seems a bit brighter, with a couple of new products, the Windows
    version of AutoCad and the scientific software HyperChem, out and 25 more
    to be released at the end of FY 1992.

Abstract:
    San Diego law enforcement officials claim to have cracked a nationwide
    network of young computer hackers who have been able to make fraudulent
    credit card purchases and break into the electronic files of at least one
    credit-rating agency. Between 1989 and 1992, as many as 1,000 members of
    the informal network have exchanged information on how to make fraudulent
    credit card charges and break computer security codes. San Diego police
    stumbled upon the network while investigating a local case of credit card
    fraud. Two suspects have been apprehended in Ohio and related computer
    equipment seized in New York. MasterCard International lost $381 million
    from credit card fraud worldwide in 1991. Visa International lost $259
    million in 1989 for the same reason.

Abstract:
    The current trend among computer hackers is to access corporate electronic
    mail systems and use the office phones to make long distance telephone
    calls. This illegal practise is under investigation by both the Secret
    Service and the Federal Bureau of Investigation. Current voice-mail systems
    have relatively simple access codes which are easy to crack. Some hackers
    have even changed the corporate passwords, rendering the e-mail system
    useless to company employees trying to access their messages. The long
    distance companies' clamp down on their own system abuses has led hackers
    to this new field of opportunity. Analysts believe that the only way for a
    corporation to avoid the abuse is to improve phone system security.

Abstract:
    While computer crime is increasing, many are complaining that the
    government's response to it has, in many cases, been overly harsh and has
    in some cases violated civil liberties. To help defend users who have been
    unfairly abused by prosecuting agencies, a group called the Electronic
    Frontier Foundation has been established by several prominent computer
    industry personalities, including founders of Apple Computer and Lotus
    Development. The foundation's main complaint is that while most hackers are
    relatively harmless explorers, they are treated by the Secret Service and
    other investigators as though they were drug smugglers. The complaints
    point out that laws and law enforcement agencies have fallen behind the
    technology they are trying to police.

Abstract:
    Computer hackers are causing increased concern among banks, credit bureaus,
    telephone companies and other businesses that rely on computers connected
    by telephone lines. Any company with a computer connected to a phone is at
    risk of being accessed by hackers, according to observers. Frank Darden is
    one such hacker who was arrested by Secret Service agents and charged with
    felony counts of conspiracy and wire fraud for breaking into BellSouth
    Corp's computer. Darden claims that getting into BellSouth's computer was
    relatively easy, and that he did it only for the challenge it provided.

Abstract:
    Mitchell Kapor, creator of Lotus 1-2-3, and Steve Wozniak, Apple cofounder,
    inaugurate a new group, the Electronic Frontier Foundation, aiming to
    provide legal aid for computer hackers facing criminal prosecution and to
    research legal aspects of computer communications. Kapor says the
    government's prosecution of hackers thwarts creativity and endangers the
    rights of computer users. Opponents say many hackers simply exploit holes
    in compute security in order to steal.

Abstract:
    In the wake of Robert T. Morris's conviction for perpetrating a disruptive
    computer virus, experts say little has been accomplished in the way of
    deterrence or legal landmarks. The conviction is the first under federal
    law, and prosecutors say it is important because it demonstrates that the
    law works when it is enforced. Others say the conviction should encourage
    district attorneys to take on similar cases in the future as tougher new
    laws are introduced. However, other experts feel the conviction will do
    little to deter hackers, who seem to be motivated by the challenge and
    danger involved in cracking security systems. These experts feel that the
    renewed attention to security issues on systems such as Internet caused by
    Morris's virus will help prevent future break-ins.

Abstract:
    Computer hackers are increasingly using long distance access codes stolen
    from corporations to make free phone calls, costing corporation hundreds of
    millions of dollars a year. The codes are obtained using software on a home
    computer. The software tries various combinations of four digits,
    repeatedly calling a corporation's switchboard until an access code works.
    The codes are then posted on hackers' electronic bulletin boards. Long
    distance carriers suggest several steps to preventing this form of computer
    crime. Companies should make access codes longer, cancel access codes of
    former employees immediately, alert switchboard operators to the various
    schemes, block international calls except to countries where legitimate
    business is conducted and monitor daily phone records closely.

Abstract:
    Japanese high-tech greets the first signs of hacker activity with mixed
    feelings. The Japanese, generally speaking, are pleased that their nation's
    half a million programmers are well behaved, rarely breaking into computer
    systems as programmers in America so often do. But the Japanese are
    sometimes envious of an imaginative creativity that such computer crime
    seems to signify. This year, 1988, a primitive computer virus struck a
    48,000-user personal-computer network run by NEC; another virus struck at
    Fujitsu, which makes mainframes; and a Japanese hacker has been arrested
    for breaking a Tokyo bank's automatic teller machine code, accessing the
    bank's funds. These cases are unusual because the viruses were homegrown in
    Japan, not imported. Some Japanese computer experts point out, with pride,
    that hacking is a problem that afflicts societies that have mastered the

Abstract:
    Sophisticated personal computer users cause industry observers and law
    enforcement officials to question the security of the nation's telephone
    system. Switches that route calls are, now, mostly electronic; phone
    systems, now, are like large computers. Such systems are vulnerable because
    computers that control switches can be accessed from outside - phone
    companies purposely designed them this way, for convenience. For example,
    phone companies designed ways for technicians in the field to dial into
    circuits in central offices; and a capability to eavesdrop is included, so
    that an operator can check on a line's status - and according to one
    anonymous source, so that law enforcement personnel can easily wiretap.
    Intruders with the proper commands can violate a system's integrity in
    various ways: eavesdropping; altering or destroying data; stealing
    facsimile documents; rerouting calls; or changing bills.
