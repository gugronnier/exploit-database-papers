     Tax cheaters entering the computer age: Crime: Con artists are filing
   phony returns electronically and trying to collect refunds. Officials say
   the scam is most prevalent in Southern California.
     Los Angeles Times v110 (Sun, August 25, 1991):B1, col 2, 28 col in.

Abstract:
    Tax criminals in Southern California have developed a new form of tax fraud
    using electronically filed returns. Recent investigations by the Department
    of Justice have led to several indictments including a tax preparer who is
    charged with cheating the government out of $500,000. One 'scam' involves
    setting up a phony company which lists homeless or unemployed people as
    employees. These 'employees' then file income tax returns. They do this via
    an electronic system, collecting a tax return check. Federal officers are
    unwilling to say exactly how sham companies are detected, but it is
    revealed that any electronic return with a Social Security number that does
    not match against a name will be reviewed.

     Dialing for free: thanks to hackers, cellular phone firms now face crime
   wave; an altered computer chip is permitting easy access to networks
   nationwide: Mr. Sutton's key omission. (Robert Dewayne Sutton, hacker)
     Wall Street Journal (Fri, June 14, 1991):A1(W), A1(E), col 1, 33 col in.

Abstract:
    Robert Dewayne Sutton, a 'computer hacker,' sold illegal computer chips
    that allow a user to place fraudulent calls on cellular telephone systems.
    Federal agents arrested Sutton in Feb 1989, but by that time, the wave of
    crime that Sutton allegedly started was too big to stop. Experts say that
    free calls now add up to about $200 million a year, and the US Secret
    Service, which investigates telephone crimes, fears that cellular fraud
    could amount to $600 million by 1992. Sutton, who taught himself to 'burn'
    or reprogram computer chips, apparently borrowed a program written by
    another hacker named Kenneth Steven Bailey. The original program that
    Bailey wrote included a security feature that prevented the program from
    being copied, but Sutton's version, which he sold for hundreds of dollars
    per copy, did not include that feature. Thus, there was now no control over
    the program's spread; it was sold to some who sell time to other. The
    illegal telephones were found to be widely used for drug trafficking and
    other criminal activities.

     Crime computer is a help, but can't do it all. (automated fingerprint
   identification system)
     Los Angeles Times v110 (Sat, Jan 5, 1991):A31, col 1, 23 col in.

Abstract:
    The Los Angeles Police Department is using an automated fingerprint
    identification system to track down suspects. Police departments using the
    laser system are linked to the California-ID computer run by the state
    Department of Justice. The state's computer can look for a matching
    fingerprint in 15 minutes. Fingerprints taken from suspects are enlarged
    for removal of temporary defects and are sent to the computer in a series
    of geometrical equations that correspond to an individual's fingerprint
    configuration. Computerized fingerprint matching is also used for state
    license and police position applications.

     New York Times v139, sec1 (Sun, June 3, 1990):1(N), 1(L), col 1, 36 col
   in.

Abstract:
    Government crackdown on computer crime is increasing in response to
    lawmakers and corporations but some civil liberties are being threatened by
    the investigations. Secret Service officials, who are the primary federal
    enforcers of computer crimes laws since 1984, suspect that a large number
    of bright young computer enthusiasts are responsible for many computer
    crimes including telecommunication fraud, credit card fraud, unauthorized
    access to other computers and computer viruses. The lack of legal
    precedents for search and seizure and freedom of speech as it pertains to
    the computer world raises some questions as to how the government can
    prosecute and investigate computer crimes.

      Briton said to penetrate U.S. computers. (Edward Austin Singh) (computer
    crime)
      New York Times v138, n47,668 (Oct 24, 1988):25 (2 pages).

Abstract:
    London police found and questioned Edward Austin Singh, who allegedly used
    computer networks to break into more than 200 military, corporate and
    university computer systems. The break-ins took place in both Europe and
    the United States during the past five years. Police say that Singh, who is
    described as a 'hacker', simply wanted to break into the systems. They say
    there is insufficient evidence to support a blackmail charge, which had
    been considered in connection with Singh's activities. An American security
    expert downplays the seriousness of the incident, saying that although
    Singh penetrated American networks, he did not penetrate into classified
    information. Singh has been released.
