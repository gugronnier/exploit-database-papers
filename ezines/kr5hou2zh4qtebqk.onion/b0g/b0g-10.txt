	First off, this article touches on a volatile subject. If the words 
spirituality, religion, or god make you feel queasy, skip this article. However,
if you are an open-minded person, as every good hacker ought to be, then read 
on. To avoid any hostilities, when referring to a higher-power (Allah, Yahweh, 
God, etc...) I will substitute the variable $hp. Please insert whatever string 
you please to fill in for $hp. An idea came to me the other night when I was 
writing a shell script to automate some DNS tasks. I was knee-deep in the script
when an interesting parallel hit me. Bear with me as I explain.

	People's minds operate basically like a PC. As a society we have common
languages, or protocols for communication. We have different GUI's (faces and 
clothes, etc...) and different kernel builds (personalities). To take the 
analogy a bit further, everyone capable of communication has an IP address. 
We're subneted  according to race, religion, income, nationality, or what have 
you. When it comes down to it, DNS (the phone company, governments, etc...) 
can't sort us all out. Just as every domain has an SOA (start of authority), 
humans have local leaders; for example your mayor, your mom, or your priest. 
These local leaders supply you with a hosts file. I know this sounds obnoxious,
just keep with me here. This hosts file starts with the bare essentials.
For example:

10.0.3.1	mom mommy Leslie
10.0.5.2	dad papa daddy Fred Freddie
10.0.8.3	localhost me myself I phlux wickedbadass

As time goes on, your hosts file grows and gathers information on networks 
(groups). For example a die-hard Israeli's host file might look something like 
this:

28.21.133-136.*	muslims bastards
199.2.67.*	family 
86.75.30.9	jenny
199.2.67.23	localhost me herman 
199.1.1.1	Yahweh

Or maybe a Muslim's would look like this:

199.2.67-72.*	jews infidels
28.21.136.144	localhost me ali
42.42.42.42	NES
199.1.1.1	Allah

	I think maybe you have seen my point by now. Both hosts point to the 
same address on the last line. However, the hostnames are different. This is 
the parallel I was speaking about earlier. In my studies, the similarity of 
monotheistic religions has always struck a cord with me. The only differences
in the world's one true power have been its name, and the methods used to 
worship/understand it. What this breaks down to for me, is that $hp only has 
one IP address. The difference in us all is what we have assigned to it in our
hosts files. We may interface with $hp on many different levels, but it is 
still the same thing, the same host. All of us connect on different ports, 
using different protocols.  The key of all of this is to recognize,
that we all have the same entry in our hosts file. 

	I know this article is quite a stretch. But the message of tolerance 
is vital. In the coming future, as corporations buy our freedom and sell it 
back to us; as governments try to regulate what they do not own, as privacy is
taken from us with a smile, we are going to need each other. The ones who 
understand how it all works, the ones who are not afraid of the .com's and 
.gov's, and you, the reader. We are approaching a time where knowledge will be
more valuable than cash. Arm yourself well, and update your hosts file.

 drive around silicon valley doing drivebys on high-tech industry... 
 I am not to blame, YOU are the one to blame. blah blah, yadda yadda.



 Warning:

 Many of the devices described in this article use high voltages and
 currents that won't just kill you, but will probably blow you apart 
 too. Also these devices can emit electromagnetic radiation at high
 enough levels and frequency to be harmful to biological organisms.

 The devices described in this article are illegal to build in most
 countries and using them comes under anti-hacking laws in many. 
 


 Introduction:

 Allot of people know that when a atomic bomb detonates it produces a 
 powerful electromagnetic pulse via the compton effect, which can 
 transfer enough power to electrical equipment near the detonation
 to disrupt/damage it. Now most people don't have a atomic bomb so 
 if they want to disrupt/damage electrical equipment they will have 
 to make do with something commonly called a 'EMP gun' also know as a 
 RF/radio cannon or HERF gun. (though it is not quite HERF, it should
 do the job of frying electronics well). In this article i can going
 to explain how to construct 3 types electromagnetic weapon. One is a
 omnidirection RF burst device, another a RF gun and lastly a 
 microwave gun.

 The basic idea of the RF weapon is to generate a high powered, burst
 of electromagnetic radio frequency radiation so enough power will be
 transferred via the electromagnetic radiation that it will 
 disrupt/damage the target in some way. (commonly called EMI 
 (Electro-Magnetic Interference)) Which with computers this can range
 from crashing the machine, which is called a 'softkill', to totally
 fusing its IC's, which is called a 'hardkill'. One person has called
 these type of weapons 'a poor mans nuke' as a powerful RF weapon 
 could easily give 'The Wall Street Crash' a whole new meaning. 
 
 People make the common mistake of thinking that RF weapons are very
 different to EMP weapons, they are not. they are only different in
 one way, that a EMP does not have a radio frequency, and the pulse 
 is usually a one spike, unlike RF weapons that generate a high 
 powered sine wave for a very short time. Though both use 
 electromagnetic radiation in very high levels to damage the target,
 so the in the end result either type of weapon will get a 
 'hardkill', though RF weapons have one big advantage over EMP 
 weapons, in that because the radiation is at radio frequency, so the
 majority of the radiation given of by the weapon can be guided 
 towards a target using a waveguide, where as the radiation from EMP
 weapon spread out in all directions, so 99.9% of it, is probably 
 not being transferred to the target.


 Construction Methods:

 The are 3 easy ways to build a RF weapon:

 The first one uses a large high voltage capacitor bank to provide 
 the huge alternating current to generate a RF burst, though unlike
 the other methods the frequency will be to low for the radiation
 to be guided effectively by a waveguide, unless you reduce the 
 capacitance of the capacitor bank significantly or raise the
 voltage of the capacitor bank significantly, either of these 
 things should raise the frequency significantly.

 The second a sparkgap discharge from a MARX bank to generate a RF 
 burst.

 The third uses continuos directed microwave radiation, from a 
 magnetron tube.
 


 [Method 1] [Omnidirection Destroyer]

 for constructing this RF weapon you will need:


 1. A large high voltage non-polarized capacitor or capacitor bank. 
 (capacitor bank == many capacitors hooked up in parallel). I am 
 only saying to use non-polarized capacitors as the is less danger
 of them blowing up.

 The capacitors i used for the weapon design 1, in this article are a
 5uF@20kV capacitor bank which would be approx 80cm by 40cm in size. 
 Thought for move power if you can find higher voltage capacitors 
 or/and giant ones, for example 50uF@50kV is even better! I would not
 go over 50kV though, as you will have big problems with insulation.
 An not under around 10kV as the pulse will probably be too weak. also
 the type of capacitor matter to and extent, as many capacitors will
 not be designed for this (well most) and won't work very well.
 
 You are probably thinking to yourself, where can i get mad-capacitors
 like that?#@? Well the are many answers to that, i myself have many
 high voltage capacitors (a 1.2uF@20kV bank in total) which i brought 
 for a project from a army surplus store for around $35. You can buy
 new ones though they tend to be a bit expensive. 
 If you get really stuck, you can always make a homemade capacitor 
 out of a plastic dust bin, motor oil and a few other bits that you
 can find around the home, though it will be far less efficient than 
 a manufactured one. I won't go into the construction in this article,
 though there are many sites on the internet that show you how to 
 make high voltage capacitors out of junk. (I.E. plastic tubs, oil, 
 tin foil, glass bottles, etc)



 2. A coil, of the right dimensions. 

 The dimensions of the coil depends mainly on the rating of
 you're capacitors as well as the resistance of the sparkgap.
 For the capacitors I am using in this example (5uF@20kV) a
 good coil dimension would be:

 1.5 inside radius

 3  turns of wire

 using well insulated (20kV for this) 12 AWG (american wire 
 gauge, thats 2.0523 in diameter, or you can use thicker wire if
 you can find it).

 This allows the very high current to alternate very fast using 
 the capacitor as a electrical storage tank, though the sparkgap
 will provide an additional resistance effecting the current in
 the coil.

 If you are using a different rated capacitor and don't fancy 
 doing the math to work out how your coil will perform, the are 
 many programs & spreadsheets out there that will do the hardwork
 for you.
 

 3. A low VDC to high VDC step up circuit (for example 20 volts to
 20,000 volts), as we are aiming to charge the capacitors a close
 to there rated voltage as possible (20kV).
 
 This is quite simple and can be made with the flyback out
 of the back of an old color TV and a we other easy to find bits 
 this circuit is a very simple one and can be found here:
 
 http://www.bithose.com/serfaq/REPAIR/F_hvinvert.html

 (if it is not there now, search at http://www.google.com for 
 'simple high voltage generator')
 
 I would detail it with the circuit diagram, but I would have to
 include most of the document for legal reasons. All the parts for
 this are dead easy to find, and even if you have to buy all the
 parts new, it should not cost over $30. This is probably the 
 most complex part of the device to build. (still simple though)
 
 4. A trigged sparkgap switch (or a even better a SCR if you can
 afford one and find one high enough rated, though they are very
 expensive new and probably very under rated for this purpose)

 As the only real choice for switching the current, is a sparkgap.
 though sparkgaps can be expensive. You can make a quick and 
 dirty mechanically triggered sparkgap yourself. You need these
 things:

 1. A think plastic tube. Use a thick piece of drainpipe or 
 something.

 2. Two big metal balls (at least 3cm in diameter) that will easily
 fit inside the pipe (make sure that the balls have at least a 2mm
 smaller diameter than the inside of the plastic pipe).

 3. Some flexible wire that is rated at 20kV+ (or whatever your 
 capacitors are rated at)

 4. A piece of string. 

 5. a thick small sheet of plastic (just big enough to cover one
 end of the tube) and some rubbery glue.

 6. A car battery. This connects to the voltage step up circuit. 


 take your pipe and seal up one end with the plastic sheet and 
 the rubbery glue. then take one of your large steel balls and fix is
 to the bottom of the tube at one end, before you do this remember to 
 fix the wire to the ball. Then fix the string to the other ball and
 the wire to it also... the whole thing should look something like
 this (cross section):

 Of course the are easier ways to make a sparkgap, but this is a 
 simple easy one and pretty safe to. I think :/
 
 Of course this is no where near as good or as efficient as a 
 proper manufactured sparkgap, though it will do. If you want to make
 a sparkgap to your own design for this you can, this is just a 
 suggested design, and not a very good one at that.

         ----------COIL --------------------< FROM SPARKGAP
                     
               

 As you can see this is a dead simple circuit, so it 
 should make sense. as you can see the voltage step up 
 circuit connects to the capacitor bank to charge it at 20kV.
 Then when the capacitors are fully charged the sparkgap allows
 the circuit to be closed and the energy stored in the 
 capacitor bank to flow through the coil very quickly, and
 because the capacitors are non-polarized, the high current 
 should alternate like crazy in the coil giving a radio 
 frequency burst of electromagnetic radiation which will radiate
 from the coil in all directions. The final frequency of the 
 pulse will be unregulated so will change rapidly as the 
 voltage drops but it can go as high as somewhere around 300KHz
 though it really depends on the overall resistance of the
 circuit. Power levels (at Max not taking into account the
 resistance from the sparkgap and at Min taking a optimistic
 guess): 

 Max: 1 gigawatts     ph33rs0me, but perhaps unrealistic because
                      of the added big resistance from the
                      sparkgap.

 Min: 200 megawatts   
 
 
 the burst will last for approx .2 of a millisecond
 


 Things to Remember:

 1. Make sure the voltage you charge the capacitors with is lower 
 than the rating on the capacitor, otherwise the dielectric will 
 break down and damage to the capacitors may result.

 2. the capacitors can sometimes recharge themselves a bit, so 
 careful!
 
 3. careful with what you discharge the capacitors/capacitor bank
 with as shorting with some objects may cause them to vaporize or 
 explode, or something like that. (i don't really know what will 
 happen, but it you can bet it will be bad!)

 4. The discharge from the high voltage capacitors is totally 
 lethal. 

 5. make sure your hook up wire is as thick as possible. 


 
 Damage and Range of this weapon:

 I have not built or tested one of these and that is the only real 
 way to know, though at a guess i would say that at the least this
 design should be able to totally destroy a computer as far away as
 10 metres and at the most be able to destroy every electrical
 object in a office complex.




 [Method 2] [RF Pulse Gun]:

 This way is a bit less simple as the board RF frequency pulse is
 generated by a high powered sparkgap discharge, though unlike
 the last method, the pulse that is generated can be directed by a 
 waveguide. For this design you will need:
 
 1. a good sized MARX generator setup, use a some nice big chunky 
 capacitors. You can see a home made MARX generator setup here with
 construction information: 

 http://home.earthlink.net/~jimlux/hv/marx.htm 

 as i won't detail it here. (If that link didn't work just go to 
 http://www.google.com and type 'MARX generator' it won't take you
 long to find the simple schematic, though you have to get the 
 values right for the sparkgap distance, resistor levels etc.
 If you want to get rid of the sparkgap jitter, and you can afford 
 it, you can replace the sparkgaps with SCR's or triggered
 sparkgaps. If you are thinking of building a very compact MARX 
 generator, EG&G make a very compact sparkgap, though they might 
 only supply them to the US military i suspect. 
 
 2. A really thick plastic tube. These are easy to find, just 
 use a bit of hosepipe or something.

 3. A simple waveguide. 

 This easy to build of a bit of sheet metal, though some 
 calculations will need doing to determine best angle (again the is 
 software about to work all this out). It should look like a horn 
 type thing when finished.

 a waveguide should look something like this (cross section):

          /
         / 
        /                        @ == emitter coil
       /
      /                          though the waveguide shown on the
     /                           left should be allot more concave 
    | @                          but my art-skillz are totally                                                                  
     \                           rubbish.
      \
       \
        \
         \
          \


 the waveguide should basically guide the RF radiation 
 towards the target, you can make the beam tight or wider beam, 
 though the tighter beams will be more powerful and give the gun
 a greater effective range naturally. The waveguides ability guide
 the electromagnetic radiation also depends allot on the frequency
 of a pulse, as for instance a 500KHz pulse will take a waveguide 
 300 metres across to guide it in the right direction, where as 
 a pulse of around 80MHz will only take a waveguide of 3 metres 
 across to guide it effectively, though waveguides do tend to be
 inefficient at frequencies under 700MHz. The frequency of the RF
 pulse for this type of weapon will be very wide, though should 
 easily output radiation in the 100MHz+ range so a waveguide will
 work. I would measure the RF given off by the sparkgap discharge
 using a RF meter then design a simple waveguide to suit the 
 frequency range.

 4. A low voltage DC to high voltage DC generator. If you actually 
 need one of these depends on the voltage of the capacitors you are
 using in the MARX bank. So if you are using high voltage cap's you
 will need one. The link has been given in the construction details
 of the first design.
 
 I won't go into this one much, its not really that complex, though 
 you might have problems with insulation if you are trying to build 
 it as is uses very very high voltages. All you need to do is 
 discharge the MARX generator through a sparkgap. The gap for the 
 spark to jump is inside the pipe to stop the high voltage shorting
 over the nearby waveguide. (the sparkgap is at one end of the 
 waveguide) Then the RF pulse is directed at towards the target by
 the waveguide. If you want an example of this look at the so called
 HERF gun at Infowarcon99 which used and ignition coil driver and
 sparkgap discharge to generate the RF energy. Though using a MARX 
 bank the pulse will be a hell of allot more powerful, and toast a 
 computer to 'extra crispy' levels. I have no idea what the effective
 range would be, as it depends allot on how powerful the discharge 
 is from the MARX generator and to an extent how tight the waveguide
 is. If you want to see a example of a sparkgap RF generation weapon
 visit http://www.empherf.com where a chap called slava has built a
 RF weapon very similar to the one showed off at Infowarcon99, 
 (infact almost a copy) though that only uses a ignition coil driver
 to provide the high voltage spark. The method using a MARX 
 generator described above should be far, far more powerful than 
 that, Oh yes.



 [Method 3] [Microwave Gun]:

 This is a very very simple way of building a Electromagnetic weapon,
 and will have a considerable range because of the high frequency.
 though the radiation given off will be around 2.5GHz so it will 
 have harmful effects on biological organisms, so careful what you
 point it at as it will cook at long range and radiation can reflect
 back at you!

 Ok first you need to get your grubby hands on a microwave oven,
 so...

 Rip open the microwave oven, discharge all the capacitors then take 
 out all the parts (intact, don't disconnect anything! and if you do
 have to disconnect anything to get the insides out of the case make 
 sure you note exactly where all the wires went and reconnect them 
 where you found them) take the magnetron tube, which should be 
 positioned in a small cavity surrounded by a small waveguide at the
 top or side of the microwave oven and put a very tight long 
 waveguide round it. (again you need to work out the best dimension
 here because i can't be bothered, though the horn should look like
 a very nearly straight pipe and won't have to be very long because
 of the wavelength) This should easily fry a computer at 50 metres 
 very possibly much further if the waveguide is correct and you did
 not hack apart one of those old very low powered microwave ovens 
 from the 80's. Oh you can point it at lightbulbs and they should 
 light up too. The disadvantage of this weapon is that you have to 
 have it plugged in at the mains, or have a portable generator with
 you.

 If you want to see what will happen to a computer when this microwave
 gun shoots it, put a calculator in a microwave oven and turn it on, 
 at full power for only a few seconds.

 I advise against opening up microwave ovens through as they contain
 high voltage capacitors that even when the oven is unplugged, have 
 easily enough charge to kill, also the microwave radiation produced
 by a device like this can cause deep thermal burns, blindness and 
 other bad side effects. Though if you feel like having a try 
 consulting the microwave oven repair FAQ at http://www.repairfaq.org
 to find out about how to take the insides of the oven out without 
 getting yourself toasted in the process.

This program is DAMN useful in exams.  When the teacher comes round to clear the 
calculators of all data, simply run this program, and pass it to the teacher, 
they'll press the (CL) key, and presume that all formulas have been wiped, 
actually leaving the calculator just how it was when you gave it to them.  U can 
store whatever programs u need for the exam, and they won't be deleted!  
Although the program isn't an exact representation of what the 'reset' button 
does, it's close enough, and if u have an examiner who is a stupid fuck, like I 
just did, u can get away with it.  If anyone know how to highlight text, e-mail

subtl 

Well, it's about that time again. Prom is lurking around the corner for all of 
us American high schoolers. Mine is April 21. The number one priority of your 
night shouldn't be having fun with your friends, no sir. It should be getting 
laid (which is fun also, unless you're a complete fuckface). Now, obviously 
there are several ways you could attempt this. There are the subtle ways like 
"Hey, nice shoes - wanna fuck?" or "Here, take another drink!", then there are 
the esd ways. Sure, you could go ahead and do those first things, god knows I 
used to.
But there are other ways my friends, and I will reveal them to you. First of 
all, dates are generally bad to bring to prom. Let's take my situation. Prom 
tickets are $25 a piece this year. Gas money is around $15 probably. Paying for 
dinner would be another $30 and a corsage would be like $20. Taking a date 
roughly costs me, oh, $90. And this doesn't even guarantee getting laid. Now, 
say I go with some friends. $25 for one ticket, no gas money, no corsage (I have 
no idea if I'm spelling that right) and maybe $10 for some food. $35. A total 
savings of $55. Whoo. Ok, so you get to the prom. What the hell are you going to 
do? Everyone's here with dates right? Wrong. Most of the people at proms now 
don't take dates. This leaves you with a nice selection of healthy, grade A, 
premium booty. Like I said earlier, you could get her drunk as fuck and nail 
her, but anyone can do that. You want to separate yourself from the desperate 
losers. If you do get a hot girl drunk -- and she's popular -- let's just say 
you'll be waiting a while to have sex with anyone involved with her for a while. 
So, use my technique. Pick a girl out that you like. Obviously, she can't be a 
virgin (unless it's a freshman of course, or an ugly bitch) because most likely 
she won't give it up. After you've selected your prey, er, girl, walk up to her 
and ask her to dance. This works incredibly well on freshmen by the way, because 
they're so naive. Heh. 
While your dancing, tell her she's hot tonight. Don't go for any of that cheesy 
Casanova shot, girls don't go for that as much as you think. She'll probably be 
trying to think of something to say, don't let her talk. Ask her who she came 
with. Basically, the main idea here is to talk while your dancing. Come off as 
relaxed and don't make it too obvious you're hitting on her (yet). If you just 
dance with her and stare off into the crowd, you're not going to get shit. While 
talking, you're going to have to come off as cocky, they like guys who are a 
little full of themselves. Ask her if she likes your tux. This whole convo is 
going to have to be improve on your part. If you're talking to a freshman you 
haven't really talked to before, she's probably not going to know what to say 
for the most part, so it's going to be your job to hold up the conversation. 

After the dance, ask her if she wants something to drink. If she says yes -- 
you're in, if not -- you're out. I could write a whole new article on how to 
redeem yourself if you messed up horribly on the dancing part, but I don't 
really have time. So let's assume she says yes. Sit down and chill with her for 
a while. While sitting, you're not going to be as talkative as the dance, but 
you still want to talk with her. Ask her if she's doing anything after the dance 
and if she isn't then see if she wants to come to your house or a friends house 
to watch a couple movies you rented (heh). The movies part is classic - works 
about every time. Assuming she says she'd like that; you're in. If she wants to 
go with you somewhere you're pretty much guaranteed a fuck. But, you're going to 
want to keep it cool for a while longer. 
When you get back to wherever you're taking her, you have a couple choices. You 
could do some of the things I listed above if you're feeling extremely horny - 
get her drunk, just ask her if she'd like to have sex or hell, slip her some 
roofies, whatever. Or you can test yourself and actually sit down and watch a 
movie. Out of those 3 things above, the 2nd one actually has worked for me on 
several occasions. Let's assume, however, you're sitting down to a movie you've 
rented. Scary movies are ok, lovey dovey movies aren't. Comedy is the way I go 
though. Believe it or not, her seeing you laughing will probably get you in 
better than anything else. After the movie has started - it's smooth sailing. If 
you fuck this one up; you're a moron and you'll never get laid. 
Happy hunting gentlemen. By the way – 
"If all else fails, and you've seen no pink, slip some roofies in her drink.."

[introduction] 

In this text I will be talking about how to make a simple taser from a flash 
camera. It is strong enough to incapacitate someone. This text starts with 
the most simple way to do it. 
The second part goes in depth on how this works, how to improve your taser, 
etcetera. 

[taser, quicky style] 

Take your flash camera, open it up. Make sure no batteries are in the camera. 
Locate the flash. Cut the wires right when they enter the flash. You should 
have a red and green one, but can also be red and black, etc. There can 
be a third wire that disappears into a little round cylinder. You don't 
need that, cut the wire off at the base of the cylinder. 
Now you need to either know how to solder or get someone else to do it. 
Get two pieces of conducting wire. Copper wire is good because it will push 
against the target and won't wreck the printing plate if pushed too hard. 
Where the wires disappear in the printing plate (green plate where everything 
is on), solder one wire off. Stick the copper wire in the hole and solder 
it tight. Repeat for the other wire. You should have to copper wires sticking 
out of the printing plate now. It should be plastic covered except for the 
ends. 
Put it back together and hook up a battery. If you have a throw away camera 
you probably can't put it back, then just tape it ALL up. Do it well or 
you will zap yourself. 
After you put it back together it works just as usual, push the flash button, 
or pull the switch, whatever applies to you and wait for the light to go 
on. It can be used even after having the switch over for a second, but it 
won't be as strong. 

Usually this will give you about 100 micro Farad at around 300 volts. Mine 
does 100 micro Farad at 330 volts and after loading it for two seconds it 
already is enough to make somebody's side feel like something smashed into 
it. Yes, we know this by testing. 
To test if yours is working charge the flash and then hold a screwdriver 
with a PLASTIC handle against the two wires. You hold the plastic part, 
the metal parts of the screwdriver touch the wires. If you did it right 
it will give two sparks. Your screwdriver might have two black singe marks. 
My friend has one that will actually weld to the screwdriver everytime. 

[how it all works] 

First the most interesting part: the shock. How do you know how strong your 
particular camera can zap someone? When you open your camera there will 
be a big cylinder. It will say something like: 100µF/300V. That is a capacitor. 
The higher the amount of Farad's the stronger the zap will be. The higher 
the voltage, well you know that one. =) 
What happens when your flash camera makes a picture is this. The batteries 
go through some electrical components to boost it's electrical power from 
a 1.5v to something around 300v. It then enters the capacitor which stores 
the power. The micro Farad's being how much of it stores. 
Then when the wires connect, the circuit is shorted and the capacitor releases 
what it has stored. There are two types of capacitors: polarized and non- 
polarized. Flash camera's have polarized because it needs to go in one way 
and leave the other. Last time I checked Radio shack they only had the non- 
polarized type. You can recognize it the easiest like this: polarized capacitors 
are usually cylinder shaped and non-polarized are disc shaped, ie: flat. 

Real stun-guns/tasers work with a high voltage (in the fifty-thousand range) 
and a low amount of amps. It is not voltage that kills a person, but the 
amperage of it. 

[how to improve your taser] 

You might get bored of your taser after a while, so here are some things 
you can do to improve your taser. 

Capacitors 
I was wondering if I should mention this, but full disclosure should not 
just count for vulnerabilities in software. There are some big capacitors 
in old TV's. Now you should know that TV's hold their charge for years and 
years and have enough power to kill you, so you will want to stay away from 
TV's if you don't know what you are doing. But here goes. If you want to 
get rid of the biggest risk do the following. Open the back of the TV. There 
should be something looking like a suction cup attached to the back of the 
screen. Carefully take it off by its plastic and then hold a screwdriver 
against the metal part in the suction cup. Make sure you do it well. Oh 
and some sparks may fly. 
That was your biggest problem. Now look at the printing plate. You will 
see a lot of cylinders. Locate the ones that say something about µF's and 
V's. Then decide which size you want. I have seen ones anywhere from 4µf/35v 
which is very tiny, to 200µF/250v and a huge one the size of my fist that 
said 25000v, but that was in a special casing and that is just too much 
for anyone in their right mind. 
Now make sure the capacitor is discharged and solder it off. Then open up 
your camera and remove your old capacitor. Locate on which side the colored 
line with the small rectangles along the side of the capacitor is. That 
is the plus, put capacitors in wrong and they break. Then solder the new 
one in with the plus on the right side. 
If you can find a few capacitors that are equal in volts, you can hook them 
up in parallel. That means that they are both hooked up in the same place, 
like this: 

+ ......    . and | is wire or printing plate 
  | |       = is capacitor 
  = = 
  | | 
- ...... 

Don't do it like this or it will likely mess up, ie: no full discharges 
or multiple delayed discharges. 

+ ...... 
  | 
  = 
  | 
  = 
- ...... 

Don't bother with attaching a 9v battery instead of a 1.5v battery: it won't 
work. The circuit will just cut out on you and not do anything. 
If your old capacitor said 300v, don't expect your new 500v capacitor to 
be charged at 500v. The components before the capacitor dictate the voltage. 
The more your capacitor holds the longer it takes before it is fully charged. 
Use a multimeter to get reliable measurements on the exact voltage. Usually 
it is about 30 volts more than the capacitor says it holds. I do not know 
why a capacitor holds higher voltages than it says on the outside, but I'm 
just stating facts.

[ 5:. - [ Introduction to the BASH Shell ]                [fluid] :. ]

Intro

The bourne-again shell, or bash for short, is quickly becoming a very popular
shell. The bash shell has many great features, including many advantages the
the C and Korn shell have. Bash has command-line features which usually get
lots of notice. Another major feature is its job controls. Bash has become so
popular that it is usually used as the default shell for linux operating
systems.

Basics

To execute a command in bash, you have to supply the directory and executable
name. If I wanted to execute party in my /root/personal folder, I'd do
/root/personal/party. People quickly found this inconvenient so the programmers
developed a thing call working directory. You can navigate directories using
the 'cd'(change directory) command. If you are lost, typing 'pwd' will show you
your current working directory. In order to know where your going, your going
to have to see what's in the directory. That can be accomplished by using the
'ls' command. There are special characters in bash as showed in the table below

character | function
========================
.	  | means the current directory
..      | means the parent directory
?	  | represents 1 character of anything
*	  | represents infinite characters of anything

These 4 will now be explained with examples. If you were in /root/personal and
you wanted to execute party which was in the directory you were in, you
couldn't just type party. If you just type party, it'd search in your PATH
locations, which are defaultly set to /bin, /usr/bin, /usr/local/bin,
/usr/sbin and /sbin. Instead you'd have to do './party' meaning in the current
directory, run party. If you were in /root/personal/mail and wanted to run
party, you could do '../party', which would mean in the parent directory(the
one right before it) run party. If you were in /root/personal and type 'cd ..'
it would take you to /root. Now for the ? and * examples. If you had the
following files in a directory:

baaaaaabby beebby bibby bobby and bubby

If you typed 'ls b?bby' you'd be saying list all the files which start with a
b, then have any character, then ends with bby. 

ls b?bby
will list:
bibby bobby bubby

If you did 'ls b*bby' you'd be saying list all the files which start with a b,
then have any amount of any characters, then ends with a bby.

ls b*bby
will list:
baaaaaabby beebby bibby bobby bubby

The * character is useful for when you want to see all the files starting with
a certain letter, or to see all of a certain of file. Examples:

ls h*
ls *.c

If you ever want to goto your home directory or use it, you can use ~. If your
username is joesmith and you type 'cd ~' it would take you to
/home/joesmith(or where-ever your home is)

Bash Input/Output
By default, executables take their input from the keyboard, and print there
output to the screen, but this can be changed. If I wanted to redirect the
output from the command 'ls' to a file, I'd do 'ls > file'. That would direct
all the information the ls would print to the screen into the file "file". If
you wanted to input all the contents of a file into a command, you can use the
< command. Such as "more < file" that would take everything from file and put
it into the more command. If you wanted to see all the info from ls in the
more format, you could do it in two commands like this 'ls > file' and 'more <
file'. Or you could use a | and do it in one command 'ls | more'. That takes
the output from ls and puts it as input for more. Another example of using the
| is 'cut =d: -f5 < /etc/passwd | sort' That would grab all the names from the
passwd file and sort them out.

Background/Foreground

Normally when you run a program it has full control over the terminal until
the program is done running. Then it throws you back into the shell. Well,
this OS isn't called multi-tasking for nothing. If you want to run a program
in the background so you never have to deal with it, put an & at the end of
the command.

Example:
bash# tar xvf big_file.tar &
[1] 2486
bash#

The [1] means it's job number 1 and the second number is the process. I'll go
into details with processes later.

What we just did is move the program into the background. But what if we want
to see what it's doing, well, we can use the foreground command('fg').

bash# fg 1

Now the program is running in the foreground at the terminal.

If you wanted to stop the program from running, you could do.

bash# kill %1

The process is now killed. Instead of using %1, you could have used 2486 (the
process ID).

If a program was running in the terminal, and you wanted to kill it or put it
in the background, you could use CTRL+Z. If we did CTRL+Z while tar was
un-taring it's file, we'd see

[1]+ Suspended		tar xvf big_file &

Right now the program is paused. If we wanted it to goto the back ground we'd
us bg 1, foreground, fg 1, kill it, kill %1.


Processes

To get a list of all the processes currently running, use ps (or ps -aux for
more info).Remember, if the list flies by too quick, you can use ps | more.

If you see a process there you'd like to kill, you can use the kill <process>
command. If that doesn't work, they you can use kill -9 <process>

BASH Environment Varibles

In this part of the BASH Shell tutorials we'll look at BASH Environment
Varibles, how-to edit ~/.profile and ~/.bash_profile and how to set and
use some common varibles.

Sample .bash_profile

To understand how the .bash_profile works, lets first take a look a mine:

fluid@fluidenterprises:~/$ more .bash_profile

# Set environmental variables
SHELL=/bin/bash
EDITOR=/usr/bin/vi
PATH=/sbin:/usr/sbin:/bin:/usr/bin:/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/X11R6/bin
MANPATH=/usr/man:/usr/X11/man
PS1='\u@\h:\w$ '
PS2='> '

# Run any commands
mesg y

fluid@fluidenterprises:~/$

Let me go through this file line by line.

The first line "# Set environmental variables" is a comment, all comments
in bash, sh and makefile scripts start with a #.

The second line "SHELL=/bin/bash" is your default SHELL. Set it to your
favorite shell.

The third line "EDITOR=/usr/bin/vi" is your default EDITOR. Programs will
run EDITOR when they need you to edit a file, therefore set EDITOR to your
favorite text editor.

The fourth line "PATH=/directory:/directorytwo" is the PATH's your shell
will use when searching for a command. If you ran the command "vi" the
shell would search through each of those directories, in order. If it
found a program called vi in one of those directories, it'd run it, if it
didn't find any program called vi, it would reply command not found.

The fifth line "MANPATH=/directory:/directorytwo" is the path's your shell
will use when searching for a manpage. It'll search each of those
directories in order until it finds or not finds the man page.

The sixth line "PS1='\u@\h:\w$ '" is what your prompt will be, if you
notice in the above example my prompt is fluid@fluidenterprises:~/$
\d = date
\h = host name
\s = shell name
\t = time
\u = user name
\w = working directory

The seventh line "PS2='> '" is what your prompt will be when your using
more then one line as the prompt. The same commands as above work for it.

The tenth line "mesg y" just runs the command mesg with the y argument,
which means people are allowed to request talk sessions with you and they
can write to you.

All of the command the above .bash_profile could be typed in manually
everytime you logged in. Using .bash_profile makes that a lot more
conveniant.

10. Keep telling the same person that they have bad breath even if they don't, 
and then punch them in the face. 

9. Announce in a meeting that you have AIDS. After everyone gives you the 
sympathy remarks, tell everyone how you're just kidding and tell them that they 
are all a bunch of queers. 

8. Before a meeting, fill your mouth with custard. Then during the meeting, put 
one finger in the air and make like you are hocking up a big loogie. Then spit 
the custard into a clear glass and hand it to the person next to you and say, 
"Beat that." 

7. Inform a male co-worker that he "wouldn't make a good hooker." Then piss in 
his coffee and tell him that he needs a good "ass fucking." 

6. Always walk around with a big smile on your face and keep one hand down your 
pants. 

5. Answer every question asked to you with "Fuck if I know!" Then call the 
person a racial slur that doesn't even match their race. 

4. Brag about the fact that you own a gun, and keep playing with your nuts. Get 
them really sweaty, and then walk around shaking everyone's hand. 

3. Shit on the floor in your office and when someone comes in and sees it, tell 
them it's the fake plastic kind. When they try to pick it up, and realize that 
their hand is full of shit, laugh and point. 

2. Run down the hall with your dick out while pissing all over and yell, "It 
won't stop! God help me! It won't stop!" Then, when it stops, look down and say, 
"Oh." 

1. Ask to borrow someone's pen. Bring it to the bathroom and stick it in your 
ass. Return it and tell the person to smell it. When they tell you it smells 
bad, be like, "It should! I had it in my ass!"

Part ONE: The Know how. And what you need.

1. COCOT pay-phone:

these are the easiest thing to find... some people say they cant, but about 75% 
of payfones are COCOT fones, what they are, are personalized pay-fones, owned by 
a company, achool,etc. if your in high school, the pay-fones at your school are 
COCOT ones, your school gets the money. gas stations,schools,etc. best place to 
find them.

a way to find out for sure... is too look for the 'network telecommunications' 
box attached to it ( alittle box about 1foot x 1foot , ugly ass color brownish 
green, also used for beige boxing,tapping,etc. )

2. name,number,address.

ahhh, the most important piece of material... the most easiest way to do this 
is... get your fone book and rip out a page or two, bring a pen, and on the way 
to the COCOT circle some names, that u feel comfortable saying. its always good 
to have a name u might have to spell out for the op. makes it sound more 
real,etc.

3. making things realistic....

to do this you cant act like a robot, dont have things planned out to say 
either. you must play it cool, make noises,cough,hit the fone,apologize for 
things etc. its called SEing ( social engineering...) its the most important 
part. be very polite, have a realisitc voice please... and dont fuck up... its 
that easy.. i always end my calls by saying:

---------------------------------------------------------------------
   social: alright is that it?

   op: yes sir, thats everything.

   op: you are aware of our #0 options, etc.
   social: yes i am... oh and what was your name again?
                                        
   op: anna
   
   social: thank you very much anna, you were allot of help.   
                                                              
   op: thank you sir, and thank you for using at&t
   
   op: *click*
   
   social: from the people for the people ;)
   
---------------------------------------------------------------------
 
4. can of jolt! and yes this is needed ( uma exceptions for vodka/gin/etc. )
   
ahhhhh wasnt that elite? SEing is common sence... just play it cool and all 
should be fine.
   
ok now how to do this from the start. you have selected the COCOT and have a 
print out of this... now pick up the fone and dial 1-800-232-1234 ( easy # to 
remem but wright down ) it should go like this:

---------------------------------------------------------------------

   you: *dialing 1-800-232-1234*

   op: hello, at&t teleconfrencing , anna speaking, how may i help you?
   
   you: hi yes, i would like to set up a new folder please.
   
   op: ok 1 second please...
   
   you: ok
   
   op: am i speaking to the host?
   
   you: yes
   
   op: your name sir, please.
   
   you: jim jones
   
   op: ok mr.jones, may i have your home fone #?
   
( NOTE* this is the COCOT payfone number... not the address u picked... if the 
fone does not have the number listed, before u do all this call your local op by 
dialing 0, tell them you need someone to call u back and its urgent at that 
fone, and that u need the # for it, or act like a bell employee and u need her 
to read back the #)
   
   you: yes i do, 1-707-707-7070
                                                              
   op: ok one second, let me varify this number...
   
   you: ok
   
( NOTE* ok here is the mid point, and most important.... shes calling the 
security to check to see if the # is ok for billing... if she comes back and 
says she sorry but cant bill back, either hang up and start over, or if u have 
other #'s, tell her she should try your other home # and that knowone is home, 
try to convince her its ok to bill to it... this might get confusing if its your 
first time , so i would hang up...)
    
   op: ok mr.jones everything looks good.
   
   op: may i have your address?

   (NOTE* here she is just filling out a profile one you, dun worrie )

   you: yes, 1234 east hwownzme st. , bumsville IDAHO, 35689 
( yes that is the ZIP code )
    
   op: ok, thank you.
   
   op: ok your folder is made mr.jones, the folder ID is 456456890
   
   (NOTE* this will always be a 9 digit #, wright it down)
   
   you: ok thank you.
                     
   op: did you want to start a confrence today?
   
   you: yes
   
   op: ok and the time
   
   you: today at 4pm EST
   
   op: ok, and how many participants ( pardun my shit spelling )
   
   you: 10 with the port exspantion please.
   
(NOTE* trust me from a long time of doing this , if it gets over 10 ppl it 
sucks, everyone interupts each other,etc. the port expan is so if more then 10 
ppl do come in it will let them in )
   
   op: ok, and for how long will this be.
   
   you: 3 hours please
   
(NOTE* dont be retarted and start one for like 64 hours, be realisitc please )
   
   op: ok, i have a tele-conf set for monday sept. 10 at 4pm EST, 10 ppl with
   the port exp.
       
   you: thats correct.
                      
   op: ok the dial in # is, 1-888-789-0000, the host pin is 455455 and the guest
   pin is 676676
   
(NOTE* the dial in # will always be 888, and it changes everyday, and some times
everyother day.. the pins will always be 6 digits. the person who starts the 
conf uses the host pin when they dial the 888# and it asks for the pin. the 
others use the guest pin, ask her if she can read back the #'s just to make sure 
u got the right #'s )
    
   you: ok, is that it?
   
   op: yes it is sir.
   
   you: thank you. and what was your name again?
                                                
   op: lisa
   
   you: you were very much help lisa, have a good day.
                                                               
   op: thank you for using at&t                                
   
   op: click*
   
   you: click*
   
---------------------------------------------------------------------   
( NOTE!!!!!!!!*********** the above will not always be what will happen , but 
that is the original way it happens, im not responcible if you get caught, NEVER 
EVER EVER CALL FROM YOUR HOME WITH THE HOST PIN, IF U DID, YOUR SCREWED. i would 
never call from my house with the guest pin, but its ok)

JULES
-- okay now, tell me about the bestiality bars?


VINCENT
What so you want to know?


JULES
Well, fucking animals is legal there, right?


VINCENT
Yeah, it's legal, but is ain't a hundred percent legal.  I mean you
can't walk into a restaurant, pull out a sheep, and start fuckin' away.
You're only supposed to fuck in your home or certain designated places.


JULES
Those are bestiality bars?


VINCENT
Yeah, it breaks down like this:
it's legal to buy it, it's legal to own it and, if you're the
proprietor of a bestiality bar, it's legal to sell it.  It's legal to
carry it, which doesn't really matter 'cause -- get a load of this
-- if the cops stop you, it's illegal for them to screw you.
Screwing you is a right that the cops in New Zealand don't have.


JULES
That did it, man -- I'm fuckin' goin', that's all there is to it.


VINCENT
You'll dig it the most.  But you know what the funniest thing about
New Zealand is?


JULES
What?


VINCENT
It's the little differences.  A lotta the same shit we got here,
they got there, but there they're a little different.


JULES
Examples?


VINCENT
Well, in New Zealand, you can buy goat in a movie theatre.  And I
don't mean no side of the road goat either. They give you a farm goat, like
in the country.  In Auckland, you can buy deer at MacDonald's.  Also, you
know what they call a Quarter Pounder Fish in Auckland?


JULES
They don't call it a Quarter Pounder Fish?


VINCENT
No, they got the metric system there, they wouldn't know what the
fuck a Quarter Pounder Fish is.


JULES
What'd they call it?


VINCENT
A Slippery Fuck.


JULES
(repeating) A Slippery Fuck.  
What'd they call a Big Mac?


VINCENT
Big Mac's a Big Mac, but they call it 'His Big Mac'.


JULES
What do they call a Whopper?


VINCENT
I dunno, I didn't go into a Burger King.  But you know what they put
on dogs in Christchurch instead of vasoline?


JULES
What?


VINCENT
Mayonnaise.


JULES
Goddamn!


VINCENT
I seen 'em do it.  And I don't mean a little bit on the side of the plate, 
they fuckin' drown 'em in it.

And all them other hackerz you run with, get done with, dumb quick
How the fuck you gonna cross the bronc with some bum shit?  Aight
There go the nuke.exe click, nine five one shit
All over some dumb shit, ain't that some shit
Y'all hackaz remind me of DEFCON, cause everytime

And I don't know who the fuck you think tryin to skewl
but I'm not him, aight hacker?  So watch what you do
Or you gon' find yourself, nuked like someone else
and we all thought you nuked yourself
But that couldn't have been the issue, or maybe
they just sayin that, now cause they miss you
Shit a hacker tried to diss you
That's why you cryin, lookin at the logoz of yo` cisco certs
UUnet/Security Response Team tellin the truth and it hurts
 
Chorus
 
Off the gibson I leave hackaz soft in the brain

Y'all hackaz is lamerz, not even good nukerz
What's gon' be the outcome?  Hmm, let's add up all the client trin00z
You hack, you're twisted, your linux a hoe
You're broke, the Cisco 2600 ain't yours, and e'rybody know
Your old h4x0r crew say you stupid, you be like, "So?
I love my solaris shell, I never let it go"
I'm tired of weak ass hackaz whinin over kernelz

They nuke it up for real hackaz like my mans and them
who get it on with tha catalyst the strength of the nukez with them, MAN
 
Chorus
 
 
I bring down networkz so heavy it curse the 'net
No more hackin` - nuke it in the dirt instead
You keep ircin` - lest you tryin to end up red
Cause if I end up fed, y'all end up dead
Cause youse a soft type hacka
Fake ./hack type hacka
Puss like a soft solaris hacka
Hacker iz a hacker, blood's thicker than water
We done been through the IDS and we quicker to slaughter
The bigger the backbone, the more udpkillz we brought out
We run up in there, e'rybody come out, don't nobody run out
Sun in to sun out, I'ma keep the routerz out
Nigga runnin his mouth?  I'ma blow his broadcast out
Listen, yo' ass is about to be offline
You know who gon' find you? (Who?) UUnet/Network Abuse Hotline
CERT & NIST wishin your soul farewell
but it's hard to digest with the size of the hole in your firewall

7. Prae never leaves his room or wherever the pc is so he never meets any
black people.

6. Pr0n stars didn't used to get paid. Once the pr0n industry really started
taking off, the stars realised that other people were making money off of the
pics and videos of them fucking. So they all started complaining to the people
who shoot the videos and take the photos and demanded payment. They were hot
chicks and guys with big dicks so they 0wned and got paid.

5. Do you honestly think that the general public would be enthralled with a
movie that consists mostly of *nix screens? I know most of you would but the
script kiddies and parents that want to see what their children get up to on
the net would rather watch some pretty visuals than see the real thing. And
their garbage file sounds uber secret and pr0n would prevent kiddies from
using the net and that's their target audience.

4. Gay people are controversial and stuff so if boy bands (and I use the term
'boy' loosely) admitted they are ass creamers (the phrase ass creamer is (c)
Jenosyn-) then their record sales will drop seriously and girls won't think
they're cute anymore and they'd have to sell records on their musical talent
and everyone knows they have none of that.

3. Money. That, and the fact that apparently being in Playboy and Playmate of
the Year and all that shit is quite an achievement in the n00d ch33q industry,
so, like all good secretaries, they're sleeping their way to success. I dunno
bout the big cock theory, and frankly, I don't wanna know.

2. Pussy smelling like tuna is a natural aphrodisiac (in THEORY, that is) just
like some animals start stinking when they're horny. It's a way of attracting
a mate and letting him know she's horny. But nowadays people don't like the 
smell of pussy. Heck who cares pussy is pussy =)

1. When you masturbate and your cock gets ready to cum, it opens up some tube
or other in your cock and juices start filling up. After you've cum your tube
thingy is still open so you gotta pee to close it. I think.

FOREWORD:
                  This advisory probably would have never been 
released but a friend of mine brought up the point that it might be worth 
something to someone, so I said what the hell. Besides I was looking for 
something to do at the time while on a long trip I was on so i thought i'd 
lay a lil cerebrum terd on ya. But before reading further by doing so you 
agree that any content contained within this article are strictly for 
informational 
and educational purposes only. Neither I, nor any of my collegues or affiliates 
can be held responsible in any way for any misuse of any information contained 
herein. This is released more as to be a public consumer protest for such 
pathetic security that costs innocent people allot of trouble in their everyday 
lives that could be done without. All information given is true to the best 
of my knowledge and even though more than likely would never be released 
by the original creating company, can be used as somewhat of the only known 
technical information paper I've ever seen for the software and may be treated 
as which for reference if needed. yada yada yada, basically just dont get 
all pissed off an remember fux0r luvs yew... ;oD 

SUMMARY:
                   Circumstances allowed me the opportunity to perform 
a personal audit on this software over a rather short period (so I knew 
someone that owned some properties, big deal.) of time but my findings do 
deserve recognition none the less, ya, atleast maybe, heh. A copy of this 
document has been sent to many of the larger companies which employed the 
use of this software upon time of publishing. This software was sold both 
to commercial and private hotels both in the United States and oversea's 
from the time of its creation up until about 1995 or so and can definately 
still be found in the industry today. Though the larger chains began an 
upgrade to a new system in (1999-'00) but I'd bet the farm there's still 
many extablishments still using it and its presence is still considerable. 
At the time my 'test facility' was in a larger metropolitan area and first- 
hand knowledge existed that many other hotels within the chain, also pretty 
busy establishments also used the software. Which is another story you will 
hear a little about later. The ImagINN software was sold by a company of 
which I dont recall so they probably wont hear about this though I know 
sun micro had something to do with it. Anyway in the early `80's Tharaldson 
Corporation owned facilities bought a huge contract on hundreds of copies 
for all their hotels in the chain. Examples of Tharaldson owned franchises 
would be Days Inn, Comfort Inn, Motel 6 and several other chains they would 
lease the trademarks etc. from. At the time (1997-`98) they owned well over 
300+ hotel facilities around the world and had (pretty shitty) networks 
of sorts connecting all of them. This advisory effects all versions of the 
ImagINN Custom Hotel Support Software that is still widely used in many 
Tharaldson owned locations as well as many leading competitors both private 
and chains as it was sold as commercial support software all over the U.S. 
and over sea's. Points of full information will be brought to attention 
on many vunlerabilities in the system  and effects on further exploiting 
them to their full extent. Let it be known that I in no way support the 
misuse of this information, and am doing this as one way of exposing such 
security threats as they are and see about fixing them. They need to be 
brought to attention sometime don't they? Hopefully this will cause some 
immediate upgrade or something. 

ASSESSMENT:
                  ImagINN was created for hotel support for tasks 
such as guest checkin/checkout & user info., housekeeping details, Billing 
Information, Corporate Utilities etc. created in I believe it was '85 or 
some such shit and has been, and will be in use by many facilities in the 
united states and abroad for a good while (however after 2k the majority 
will be over seas.). You can tell wether or not your system is ImagINN if 
at the idle screen a little sqare resides in the lower righ-hand corner 
with the current logged in accounts account name in it. I was told it runs 
on a variant of good 'ol D.O.S. and programmed in delphi though dont quote 
me on that. It will more than likely be a old, slow, weak, machine x286 
or below for sure and is made to run without often restarts. No logs of 
any sorts are kept besides shut-off & start-up events which can only be 
accessed by higher access accounts. It works on a hierarchial structure 
as most systems do and permissions are set per user categorized by sequential 
levels such as listed below. 
----------------------------- 
01 - Front Desk 
02 - Housekeeping 
03 - Utilities 
04 - Audit 
05 - Travel Agents 
06 - Guest History 
07 - City Ledger 
08 - System Ops. 
09 - Manager Reports 
10 - Password & Sys Maintenance 
-    ______ 
11 -.................|       
12 -................|[ These are reserved for other services that more than 
likely wont be running on the console 
13 -................|[ and are reserved for them only. You might find these 
in a large establishment with many 
14 -................|[ workstations running off a network or other features 
the software has as added options.. 
15 - ______|[ If you have any curiousity, yes, much trouble can be caused 
here as well but we wont discuss it in this. 
------------------------------ 
              In order for an account to have permissions to that specific 
resource it must be given those permissions through these access levels. 
Example, say I was a newly hired employee for the front desk position, i 
would be allowed the levels of 01, 02, and maybe even 03 under my account. 
With just this amount of access I can look at all guests in house info., 
dirty/clean rooms, bills per room etc. and so forth which isnt all that 
helpful because obviously if you fuck anything up from your account it will 
be noticed as last used writes are replaced by the last user of the particular 
resource. Now we get to the meat of this puppy. The developers of ImagINN 
werent too clever in the fact that they coded in two backdoors into all 
versions of the software as 'tst' or test accounts (my guess is the first 
development team got replaced or some shit and they just forgot about them, 
who knows...) which allow access to areas they really shouldnt... 
------------------------------- 
Account: Mickey Mouse 
Login: Mickey 
Password: Mickey 
Access: 01, 02, 03, 06, & 08 
-------------------------------- 
Account: Minnie Mouse 
Login: Minnie 
Password: Minnie 
Access: 01, 02, 06 
--------------------------------- 
              That's right, I shit you not, these accounts are real and 
do actually have those permissions. So now between our good friend Mickey 
and his bitch Minnie we have access to all the other front desk peoples 
stuff, all of housekeepings and a few utilities but thats not where the 
first prize lays. You will notice that number 06 which gives you access 
to the guest history, this is your first morsel. The guest history can go 
back as far as two to three years sometimes, and with our good friend mickey, 
an attacker can simply browse around the virtual cornicopia and copy down 
previous guests full information (Name, Address, *Credit Card Info., etc. 
things required for carding) with it also being harder to trace being able 
to go back that far. Ok so the attacker literally has hundreds of full, 
fresh, virgin,  c.c.'s just ripe for the picking, so moving on... Lets get 
into a little bit of money laundering now shall we, or atleast of course 
completely in the hypothetical sense. For our good friend Mickey we also 
see the great number 08, and as we see in my list above, number 08 is a 
good thing. However don't get too excited as its not as special as you would 
think the name represents, but it is helpful. From here you can easily go 
to the ledger the system keeps of outsourced labor and work and is responsible 
for keeping all the financial information (bills paid, bills due etc.) for 
each contracter. Synopsis, say the hotel gets re-wallpapered, well the 
information 
of the company doing the labor would be entered and all accounts and payment 
information would be under that companys ledger to be paid out at the end 
of each month by the corporate offices. Well it is as you might know by 
now quite easy to obtain a post office box these days and not too much more 
challenging to get it anonymously. Using the information just given and 
all one would have to do is enter in a bogus but legit sounding company 
in as its own ledger and set it to pay out whatever amount at the end of 
each month (an obvious note, ridiculous amounts are more than likely to 
be inspected, but still considerably large amounts would get through. $500 
max) and you can keep doing it until it gets noticed or said attacker could 
just change accounts every couple months or so, whatever. 
              Ok so lets take a look at what we've accomplished in a very 
small amount of time with very little effort indeed. Given ourselves a huge 
amount of full, fresh, untainted cc's for our disposal, allowed an easy 
way of co-worker combat, and setup a little way to make some extra cashflow 
on the side. Hmmm, please an attacker much? Yes, I'm pretty sure its safe 
to say yes. Next we move on to the next little "flaw". This one is the same 
as it is in many programs, thats right, I speak of none other than the infamous 
default passwords and permissions. The setup crews in most cases contracted 
to setup these systems would leave default accounts & their passwords for 
their clients and more than likely are still the same for whatever system 
your auditing. Accounts listed are permenant with the only thing changeable 
are passwords and permissions, and are as follows... Oh and remember everythings 
in uppercase as you'll notice by messing with the program. 
--------------------------------- 
Account: Corporate Support 
Login: Corp Sup 
Password: Diamond 
Permissions: 01, 02, 03, 04, 05, 06, 07, 08, 09, & 10! 
Note:  a *nix example, if an acct. has a uid of zero, and a group id of 
zero, it's root, right? well this is basically the equivelant. And also 
the first acct. you might wana try when ya dial in to this thang. ;ox 
---------------------------------- 
Account: Credit Cards 
Login: Crt Crds 
Password: Polish 
Permissions: 01, 02, 03, 04, 05, 06, 07, 08, 09 
Note: all its missing is password permissions but we'll get to that... 
---------------------------------- 
Account: Direct Bill Department 
Login: Dir Bill 
Password: Edison 
Permissions: 01, 04, 07, 09 
---------------------------------- 
Account: Financial Statements 
Login: 01, 04, 09 
Password: Stanza 
Permissions: 01, 04, 09 
----------------------------------- 
Account: Marketing 
Login: MRKTG 
Password: Fraction 
Permissions: 01, 06, 09 
----------------------------------- 
Account: Training Department 
Login: TRG DEPT 
Password: Magnet 
Permissions: 01, 02, 03, 04, 05, 06, 07, 08, 09 
Note: that's right, another acct. with way too many permissions... 
------------------------------------ 
               Now I'm not going to say that they will be the same on the 
system in question but with the little bit of research I did I'd say it's 
a pretty damn good bet. See when the software was installed it more than 
likely stayed the same without changes from defaults as to the fact that 
regular hotel staff in most likeliness wouldnt have the first idea on how 
to change such things. Let alone the motivation to do so. Ok, so obviously 
the most important of them is Corporate Support. This account allows you 
full access to the entire system and is meant for when corporate support 
teams do required work on the system. Now the first thing I would recommend 
doing is taking advantage of that beautiful number 10, where you can go 
and view all accounts and passwords for the system including permissions 
and other information about them in plain text, hell you even have the option 
of printing them all out in a nice and neat little form. This in a way is 
how this advisory and the silent tactics archive orignally began, with me 
finding this form I had printed out a good while back and finding it again 
in some of my old notes while cleaning and remembered what information I 
could, & now I'm starting to like it and think I'll publish many more articles 
on various subjects, but back to this one. This account also holds all corporate 
information for the premises including but not restricted to, names & 
information 
of area and regional managers, location information, events & notices, perhaps 
other secluded information that might come into handy. But it also allows 
access to all area's of the support system, most vital being the Credit 
Card Information information module & Direct Billing. This would allow the 
attacker to obtain any and all affiliated corporate credit information among 
other things. This would mean that say Sprint or some other established 
company has a support team or something staying at the hotel often enough 
for them to just have it set up through a direct billing process using saved 
authorization and account information allowing anyone with a little bit 
of wit and some patience to read some commands and they could easily setup 
a second pay-out account on top of the hotel extracting, money for bogus 
stays. Either that or they could just replace the hotels information all 
together and the company would be billed correctly for their stay at the 
facility, only the pay-out would go to the attackers pre-setup, anonymous 
acct. on a nice & neat, usually automatedly created check made out to your 
bunk co. until the hotel figures out they haven't been getting their money. 
With the other way setup a pay-out account  could easily be setup charging 
the company for smaller amounts at time of payments to be paid-out to the 
attacker at an unnoticable sequential amount so as not to bring attention 
to themselves quickly. I mean damn you would think this would be enough, 
and your right. The rest of the various methods of mayhem possible with 
the other accounts and access's are up to the attackers imagination. Perhaps 
they might create themselves a personel 'super user' account with complete 
access to anything and everything connected to that system that is accessible. 
Or perhaps it will be left merely to co-worker rivalry or something of the 
same pettiness with no real harm done. I'm sure your already asking yourself 
"well how the hell did this asshole get this far if he was just sat down 
behind a lobby desk after hours an let go to work?" and well, yes I could 
easily extend the content of this advisory to much further limits detailing 
various methods of attack from a console on such a system, but I don't think 
a lion tamer would give his lions the rest of his meat, until he was positive 
he would have more to give them when it came time. So accept the meat how 
it is and be glad it's there at all... Fools do not learn from wise men, 
wise men learn from fools. 





                So quite basically by now the system is the attackers bitch 
more or less, waiting to carry out their bidding. You would think the 
information 
to this advisory would end there, of course not, you forget who punched 
this sucker out. As any even minimally experienced cypherpunk would know, 
the passwords used on one system by someone, are quite often the same used 
on other systems the user uses. This tells us what? that perhaps further 
mischief may be achieved with the crisp clean plain-text login/password 
form that just recently printed off? Well if you said no, your a moron, 
if it was yes, good for you. During this time and probably still to date 
the Tharaldson corporation was connected internationally to every facility 
owned by them, from corporate to the hotels themselves. It was an older 
complete text based messaging system used for making/cancelling reservations, 
as well as serving the general purpose of exchanging administrative information 
throughout the network. Anything from updates and event scheduling crap 
to higher up corporate private lines and meeting rooms and what not which 
are kept indexed on the system. This system works the normal routine of 
the login/password scheme as a majority of anything of standard security 
goes. Starting off with a text based screen, using the printed out 
login/password 
list grab your district manager, manager's information, the person you think 
would have the highest access and punch in their info. The local manager, 
and facility manager have full rights to the system with rights of one 
through ten by default on the Imag system and would be one's of choice. 
On their private network of well over 300+ hotels, servers, and hell everything 
else connected like corporate machines and outsourced marketing agencies 
etc. general havok could be caused on these permissions alone. I do apologize 
though because you wont be hearing of my adventures through that system 
today, because well honestly I dont have close to enough info. on it anyway, 
but oh well. 





CONCLUSION:
                Unfortunately today we arent really forced, but 
enticed into allowing things of automation to play a large role in our everyday 
lives. Nobody likes to admit it but there are many flaws in this new way, 
and especially in the way of security. It as a subject that remains unnmentioned 
and ignored, but as a reality brings much unneeded, unnecessary bullshit. 
When you think of how many people within a days time whom you know nothing 
about yet unwillingly or unknowinglingly share your complete information. 
Information that without the systems they are based upon mean nothing, but 
now leave you vulnerable with or without awareness. Protection efforts are 
to little and don't recieve the proper attention. The media and the general 
security community are seemingly centered and trained on publicised systems 
alone. Blaming millions and millions of dollars in loss upon internet banking 
theft with hackers and the whole shabbang. Do you really think they lose 
all those millions of dollars when their website's get defaced for their 
things that are their own fault? Yet what they forget to remember are the 
people you come in contact daily an exchange that information with. The 
inhouse stuff exposed to testing every day by one continuous user that's 
bound to find flaws in a system through experience, difference is what they 
do with them. Intentions of anyone will always remain unknown unless the 
technology is created to read peoples minds or something of the sort. I'd 
be willing to bet more money than the major corporations of america lose 
every year that a very large percentage gets caught up in the exchange. 
Their own infamiliarities with their sheep comparable staff lead to their 
own loss as well as their patrons and affiliates. Hopefully some day I can 
help make things better like that, would be coo.  Anyway as I said I will 
be releasing several more of these advisories on many subjects for much 
used corporate inhouse/outsourced systems and other subjects so look for 
them. I just hope that security quits being such a disgraceful topic as 
if it is. Its a matter that should be addressed appropriately and handled 
accordingly.

                                  [psyber26@tacoshell.wi2600.org] :. ]
 ____________________________________________________________________



Maybe not all of you are interested in how to do this, but I can assure
you that one day in your life, when you least expect it, this will come in 
handy.
If anything, this is a great way to pick up chixxx. Now, onto the text.

In this article, I will be teaching you how to create your own wiener dog.
Along with that, I will describe exactly what you will need, and how to put your
new found knowledge into use.


Things you will need:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
1.) A dog (non dachshund).
2.) A muzzle.
3.) A saw.
4.) Goggles.
5.) A place to do this.

Now, the dog you will want to do this on should not be your own. Many
people will ask questions as to why your dog looks different. If you do choose 
to do this on your own dog, come up with some good excuse like your neighbor ate
its legs off, because that one always works.
I prefer getting a stray dog, because less people notice when they turn
into stubbly wiener dogs over night.

Muzzles make dogs quiet. Otherwise, dogs yelp a whole bunch, and if they
do so you may instead become too annoyed with this sound and just 'put them to
sleep' instead of turning them into a piece of art.

The saw is needed for the conversion. I know a few guys who used to use
sanders, but the noise of grinding bone can sometimes be too much to work
with, and this is why a saw is what I suggest.
NOtes to muzzle users: if you have a band saw, or something else that is
really noisy, you may not need something to quiet the dog, as this will (should)
easily outweigh the output noise of a whining dog.

Goggles are a definite yes. If it wasn't for these babies, I surely would
have slipped up on many occasions and made a real mess! But seriously here, a
friend of mine, can no longer make wiener dogs because he didn't wear goggles
like I told him to. A bone splinter shot up from the band saw and damaged his
right eye and damaged it permanently. Due to this, his perception hasn't been 
the same since, and he hasn't managed to be successful in these endeavors since.

Although you know, I know, and many others know, turning long legged dogs
into wiener dogs is completely ethical. But sadly, even in modern times there
are sick fucks stuck in the middle ages out there that go against us at every
whim.
Until they learn to grow up, we must practice our arts in hidden places,
be they in our basement, the woods, or in a far off cave. A favorite of mine is 
in abandoned warehouses, but sometimes these have those crazy homeless in
there.
Sometimes they are freaked by what you are doing, but sometimes they are
willing to help you out. Then again, sometimes they're just looking to
score some free food.

What to do next:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Now that you have everything you need, we can get moving on this.

1.) First you want to restrain the dog.
    The reason for doing this is so that he won't squirm, and mess up your
    project. A ex-friend of mine suggested beating the dog into
    submission,
    but the point of this isn't to harm our best friend.
    Muzzle up the dog in the case of it becoming bothersome. Also, if it
    gets mad, it can't bite you. I don't know why it would be mad if you're
    turning it into a wiener dog, but I'm still learning on this topic.

2.) Put your goggles on. These will definately protect you against flying
    objects, such as chunks of flesh, bone splinters, and spraying blood.
    Sure, it may be fun to get soaked your first time, but sometimes fun
    comes at a cost.

3.) Get an axe. Or a saw for that matter. The axe is swift, but you have
    more feel for what you are doing with the saw, and you feel like you've
    accomplished much more when you are finished.

4.) Put the dog on a flat surface, as this makes the job that much easier.

5.) This isn't required, but sometimes music helps. A favorite of mine is
    "Who let the dogs out?" by the Baha Men. If not, the "Lady and the
    Tramp"  soundtrack is also rather exquisite.

6.) Now that you are as prepared as can be, start sawing away. I suggest
    going slowly, as this is your first time. Going slow ensures safety, and you
    will learn more this way. By going slow, you hear the ways the bones
    are made, and how tough they are. If you understand how this is by taking
    your time, it will make your next experience at this all the more
    pleasurable.

7.) Keep working on this at your own pace. You'll get the hang of it. Make
    sure to cut above the knee, because if you don't, the little stub remaining
    just makes it harder for them to walk.


What to do when finished:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Now that you are finished, I suggest you bandage up the stubs. You don't
want your new found friend dying of blood loss now, do you? Of course not.
Clean up the mess, so when your neighbors come over to see your new pet, they 
won't
have a clue that it's not a real dachshund.


Reasons:
~~~~~~~~
Why are some people just not content with the way most dogs look like? Why
would anybody want to make a wiener dog from a 'normal' dog? For me, it's
mainly the rush I get from doing this. I also have a great appreciation
for canines, and the beauty they bring to this world. That, and I have a love
for things that are so small they look funny. Just like midgets, whenever I
see one, I just have to laugh. Same with wiener dogs, they're just hilarious.
It sure is funny as hell to see one of these things try walking on their
stumps, like an ex-nam veteran with one leg. Take this knowledge and let
it spread like a disease. Remember, don't do this at home, because you will
be caught.

  There is nothing more difficult to plan, more doubtful of success,
  nor more dangerous to manage than the creation of a new order of
  things . . . Whenever his enemies have the ability to attack the
  innovator they do so with the passion of partisans, while the others
  defend him sluggishly, so that the innovator and his party alike are
  vulnerable... -- Niccoló Machiavelli, The Prince.


Ladies and gentlemen; I don't believe that anyone in this chamber would
move to disagree with the idea that BoW is an annihilation of mind,
committed from the very depths of the darkest parts of the stupor sole.
For them, there is no line between what is good and what is lacking
quality. Their life is a circus; nothing more than an immaculate cerebral
blockage towards a life in reality. Brotherhood of Warez has changed
their way from superiority to exposed identity.
  The modern desiccated swamp, b0g, has always been my preferred e-zine.
Although I have written for b0g previously, I felt responsible to write
again. At first, I thought of writing an article about BoW, but decided
to write about the diffusion of technological innovations in its place.
Hitherto, there isn't enough interesting about BoW to write an article
about. I don't know if this article is of any interest for the b0g
readers, and if any flames ought to occur, mail me at fcf@dephocus.com.
  Enjoy anyways... and, congrats to k-rad-bob & whoever in b0g!#@! ...

( as of writing for a modern e-zine, I've chosen to focus on the
  innovation of technology... if there is any interest toward me writing
  about social innovations, let me know. most below is theoretical ... )


  What is Diffusion? ...

Diffusion is the process by which an innovation is communicated through
certain channels over time among the members of a social system. It is a
special type of communication, in that the message are concerned with
new ideas. Communication is a process in which participants create and
share information with one another in order to reach a mutual understanding.
This definition implies that communication is a process of convergence
(or divergence) as two or more individuals exchange information in order
to move toward each other (or apart) in the meanings that they give to
certain events. We think of communication as a two-way process of convergence,
rather than as a one-way, linear act in which one individual seeks to transfer
a message to another in order to achieve certain effects. A linear conception
of human communication may accurately describe certain communication acts or
events involved in diffusion, such as when a change agent seeks to persuade
a client to adopt an innovation. But when we look at what came before such
an event, and at what follows, we often realise that the event is only one
part of a total process in which information is exchanged between the two
individuals. For example, the client may come to the change agent with a
problem, and the innovation is recommended as a possible solution to this
need. The change agent-client interaction may continue through several cycles,
as a process of information exchange.
  So diffusion is a special type of communication, in which the messages are
about a new idea. This newness of the idea in the message content gives
diffusion its special character. The newness means that some degree of
uncertainty is involved in diffusion.
  Uncertainty is the degree to which a number of alternatives are perceived
with respect to the occurrence of an event and the relative probability
of these alternatives. Uncertainty implies a lack of predictability, of
structure, of information. In fact, information is a means of reducing
uncertainty. Information is a difference in matter-energy that affects
uncertainty in a situation where a choice exists among a set of alternatives.
By differences in matter-energy we mean inked letters on paper, sound waves
travelling through the air, or an electrical current in a copper wire.
Information can thus take many forms, as matter or energy. A technological
innovation embodies information and thus reduces uncertainty about
cause-effect relationships in problem-solving. For instance, adoption of
residential solar panels for water heating reduces uncertainty about future
increases in the cost of fuel.
  Diffusion is a kind of social change, defined as the process by which
alternation occurs in the structure and function of a social system. When
new ideas are invented, diffused, and are adopted or rejected, leading to
certain consequences, social change occurs. Of course such change can happen
in other ways, too, for example, through a political revolution, through a
natural event like a drought or an earthquake, or by means of a government
regulation.
  Some authors restrict the term "diffusion" to the spontaneous, unplanned
spread of new ideas, and use the concept of "dissemination" for diffusion
that is directed and managed. I'll use "diffusion" to include both the planned
and spontaneous spread of new ideas.


  Technology Innovations ...

A technology is a design for instrumental action that reduces the uncertainty
in the cause-effect relationships involved in achieving a desired outcome.*
A technology usually has two components: (1) a hardware aspect, consisting
of the tool that embodies the technology as a material or physical object,
and (2) a software aspect, consisting of the information base for the tool.
For example, we often speak of (1) "computer hardware" consisting of
semiconductors, transistors, electrical connections, and the metal frame
to protect these electronic components, and (2) "computer software" consisting
of the coded commands, instructions, and other information aspects of this tool
that allow us to use it to extend human capabilities in solving certain 
problems.
Here we see an illustration of the close relationship between a tool and the way
it is used.
  The social embedding of the hardware aspects of a technology is usually
less visible than its machinery or equipment, and so we often think of 
technology
mainly in hardware terms. Indeed, sometimes the hardware side of a technology
is dominant. But in other cases, a technology may be almost entirely composed
of information; examples are a political philosophy like Marxism, a religious
idea, a news event, a rumour, assembly-line production, and quality circles.
The diffusion of such software innovations has been investigated, although
a methodological problem in such studies is that their adoption cannot be
so easily traced or observed in a physical sense. 
  A number of new products involved a hardware component and a software
component, with the hardware purchased first so that the software component
can then be utilized. Examples are VCRs and videotapes, cameras and film,
and compact disc players and CDs. Often a company will sell the hardware
product at a relative high price in order to recover profits. An example
is the Nintendo gameplayer, which was once sold at a fairly low price
(about $100), but with each Nintendo video game sold at a relative high price
(about $60). This is sometimes called a shaver-and-blades strategy.
  Some innovations only have a software component, which means they have
a relatively lower degree of observability and thus a slower rate of innovation.
Such idea-only innovations have seldom been studied by diffusion scholars,
perhaps because their spread is relatively difficult to trace.
  Even though the software component of a technology is often not so easy to
observe, we should not forget that technology almost always represents a
mixture of hardware and software aspects. According to our definition,
technology is a means of uncertainty reduction that is made possible by
information about the cause-effect relationships on which the technology
is based. This information often results from scientific R&D activities
when the technology is being developed. A technological innovation usually
has at least some degree of benefit for its potential adopters. This
advantage is not always very clear-cut, at least not to the intended adopters.
They are seldom certain that an innovation represents a superior alternative
to the previous practice that it might replace.
  So a technological innovation creates one kind of uncertainty (about its
expected consequences) in the mind of potential adopters, as well as
representing an opportunity for reduced uncertainty in another sense 
(reduced by the information base of the technology). The latter type of
potential uncertainty reduction (from the information embodied in the
technological innovation itself) represents the possible efficacy of the
innovation in solving an individual's perceived problem; the advantage
provides the motivation that impels an individual to exert effort in order
to learn about the innovation. Once such information-seeking activities have
reduced the uncertainty about the innovation's expected consequences to
a tolerable level for the individual, a decision concerning adoption or
rejection will be made. If a new idea is used by an individual, further
evaluate information about its effects is obtained. Thus, the innovation-
decision process is essentially an information-seeking and information-
processing activity in which the individual is motivated to reduce
uncertainty about the advantages and disadvantages of the innovation.
  We distinguish two kinds of information in respect to the technological
innovation.

  1. Software information, which is embodied in a technology and serves to
     reduce uncertainty about the cause-effect relationships in achieving
     a desired outcome.
  2. Innovation-evaluation information, which is the reduction in uncertainty
     about an innovation's expected consequences.


  Technology Clusters ...

An important conceptual and methodological issue is to determine the boundaries
around a technological innovation. The practical problem is how to determine
where one innovation stops and another begins. If an innovation is an idea that
is perceived as new, this boundary between innovations ought to be determined
by the potential adopters who do the perceiving. In fact, this approach is used
by diffusion scholars and by market researchers in positioning studies. For
example, a California study of the diffusion of recycling found that households
that recycled paper were also likely to recycle bottles and cans, although many
families only recycled paper; presumably the two recycling behaviours 
represented
two innovations that were part of an interrelated cluster of recycling ideas. A
technology cluster consists of one or more distinguishable elements of 
technology
that are perceived as being closely interrelated. Some change agencies promote a
package of innovations because they find that the innovations are thus adopted
more rapidly. An example of a technology cluster was the package of rice- or
wheat-growing innovations that led to the Green Revolution in the Third World
countries of Latin America, Africa, and Asia. In addition to the so-called 
miracle
varieties of rice and wheat, the cluster included chemical fertilisers,
pesticides, and thicker planting of the seeds.
  Past diffusion research has generally investigated each innovation as if it
were independent from other innovations. This is a dubious assumption, in that
an adopter's experience with one innovation obviously influences that 
individual's
perception of the next innovation to diffuse through the individual's system. In
reality, a set of innovations diffusing at about the same time in a system are
interdependent. It is much simpler for diffusion scholars to investigate the
spread of each innovation as an independent event, but this is a distortion of
reality...


* This definition of technology as information is based upon Thompson (1967)
  and Eveland (1986), who stress the uncertainty-reduction aspect of technology,
  and thus the important role of information, a view of technology that has not
  been widely recognised. Technology is information and transfer is a       
communication
  process, and so technology transfer is the communication of information 
(Eveland).

hi kids. when i'm n0t busy being a lamer, i enj0y hacking the planet. mainly 
with my ph0nes and my sekret teleph0ne utility belt. n0w, we here at hack 
kanaduh have super p0wrz and skills bey0nd c0mprehenti0n, s0 we kn0w h0w t0 
hack. this is h0w i al0ne figured 0ut h0w t0 hack, nay, phreak if y0u will, any 
payph0ne that y0u, the average lamer, might see 0n the street s0mewhere.

0k. first, y0u pick up the receiver and insert m0ney int0 the h0le. i have als0 
f0und that making y0urself cum int0 the h0le w0rks f0r this as well. anyways, 
then y0u dial a teleph0ne number 0f y0ur ch0ice. my fav0urites are the l0cal 
ph0ne sex linez, my hack kanaduh krews's's's pagers and cellular teleph0nes, and 
s0metimes even the teleph0ne c0mpany. i like calling them and talking t0 
0perat0rs. i then write ab0ut m0re c00l expl0its cuz ima hacker. and this is the 
way 0f the hacker. back t0 the expl0it. 0nce c0nnected, y0u speak int0 the 
receiver. magically, it will seem y0u are talking t0 the pers0n y0u dialed. 
fjears0me.

n0w, take heed. 0r was that weed? 0r e? fuck, n0w my raver trash ass cann0t 
remember. 0h well. this expl0it is brand new and super elite, s0 d0n't g0 ar0und 
telling pe0ple ab0ut it. 0r else the f0ne c0mpaneez ar0und the w0rld will catch 
0n and that means n0 m0re fun f0r us f0lk. 

pr0ps t0 my b0ys in hack kanaduh and all y0u 0ther mad elite lamers in kanaduh 
that think y0u have skills but c0uldn't amm0unt up t0 my super stealing lying 
bad ass.

Santa's Therapy Song by chris`


       G  G   G   x     Em      Em x x x Em
Have a merry fucking christmas,
 x  x C  C  C    x    D    D x x x D
and a happy new years too,
    G   G  G   x  Em  Em
but if you get on my nerves
         C               D
there's lots of ways to kill you.

(Follow Same Format..)

I can impale you with an antler,
or choke you with my joy.
I can stab you in the back with..
a poorly manufactured toy.

I can shoot you with a shotgun,
or this crossbow that I found.
Or maybe I'll just dig a hole
and bury you in the ground.

Have a merry fucking christmas,
all the boys and girls.
All this happy-jolly shit,
makes me want to hurl.

(Break from music, say this part in a santa-typed voice).

Kiss my ass you pansies,
Fuck you and your toys..

Strumming 

G x x G x G x x x G x x 
Em x x Em x Em x x x Em x x 
C x x C x C x x x C x x 
D x x D x D x x x D x x 

(Back to music.)

This upcoming Christmas,
don't ask me for shit.
Instead sit down at your PC,
and look at b0g a bit.

Even though Santa hates you, kids,
He'll come through for you.
You'll get your presents at midnight,
when Rudolphs shits on your roof.

        G               Em
Have a merry fucking christmas
        C              D
and a happy new years too,
 G                 Em
Santa needs some therapy,
        C               D
so he doesn't kill the jews.


Merry Christmas everyone!

I was inspired by Tak's article in b0g #9, and i'm building myself a haxor room. 
Its under the foundation of my house, and i'm working on the tunnel and saving 
up for waterproof tarp and insulation/drywall/bricks etc.as of writing this 
article ive gotten 2 whellbarrowfuls of dirt out of the ground. for the february 
or march article im gonna have a logbook of the progress ive made, and if i dont 
you can stuff my dick full of weed light my balls and puff.i live in a one story 
triplex apartment thingy. Here is a diagram:

There you go. Its on a big cement foundation. The little square in the backyard 
is the lovcation tha6t Im digging the tunnel at. After about six feet of going 
straight down, Im going to head toward the house and if the foundation is still 
there, I'm going to keep going down along it until it ends. The room will be 
seven feet from roof to floor. Im going to line it with tarp when I get it all 
squared off and haul all the dirt out. I will compact the dirt on the walls 
ceiling and floor until it is hella hard, and then drive 3foot spikes into the 
corners of the tarp to hold it on. Then I will put brick along the walls from 
top to bottom and lay plywood on the floor, against the brick, and on the 
ceiling. I will have the plywood held on the ceiling by laying it on top of the 
brick but under the tarp. Then for the final step Ill put drywall on the walls 
and paint it ninja style. then ill furnish it with desks and puters and fans and 
shit. for power i will run a cable up the side of!
 the tunnel through a nearby window into the house. ive got about 400 6 outlet 
power surge strips, and ill hook them up to each other allot in the room so 
there will be like a billion outlets, im gonna get a minifridge and shit there 
too. To prevent it from flooding, remeber how I said it would stop after 6 feet 
and go toward the house on a flat plane? here ill draw a diagram:

Not only will the water trap be there, but on the top of the tunnel, flush with 
the ground, I'm going to have a hinged and handled piece of plywood with plastic 
or tarp on it covering the opening so that rain doesnt just go straight in the 
room. At the bottom of the water trap, through the grate, Im going to toss 
sponges and silica gel and shit down there. Also down the side of the tunnel 
there will be a bundle of cables, it will consist of bigass phone cord extention 
cord and a hose. the phone is for my comp/phone (duh) the power is for lamps, 
comps, fridge, etc, and the hose will have a tist thing at the end so u can turn 
it on and off w/o going outside. I think thats like all i have to say so

Cheers go out to WIZKID for correcting one of my articles and
making me look really stupid - Thanks man!

Before WIZKID gets a chance to make me look really stupid again,
I'll correct myself: No. 10 in my getting good grades in school article
was meant to be "bribe your teacher", not "blackmail your teacher". I
was just kind of weird.

First, I'd like to start with some great quotes:

'A true friend stabs you in front' - No idea whose this is

'So many untalented people are making so much money in the
 music business these days' - A Spice Girl

'Explaining a joke is like dissecting a frog. 
 You can do it, but it dies in the process.' - No idea here either

What is this really weird article about?
It is about writing neat shell-scripts.
About using dialog boxes in your shell scripts.


First of all, to be able to get the full advantage
of this article, you should be using either the
Bourne Shell (/bin/sh) or the Bourne Again Shell (/bin/bash).
These usually come with Linux and various other Unix clones,
though Solaris (aka Slowlaris) (as far as I know) 
doesn't come with bash, stupid as it is.
So if you don't have it, be smart and search for it yourself.
You can probably find it almost anywhere 
(including http://www.tucows.com *hint hint*)
You have to be on a Unix clone by the way (*DUH!*).

Also, of course to be able to use the dialog boxes in your
shell scripts, you'll need the program/library that enables
you to do this.
You can download it at:
ftp://sunsite.unc.edu/pub/Linux/utils/shell/
The most recent version (at time of writing this article) is:
dialog-0.6z.tar.gz
(Actually, seeing as the last update of dialog was a few years
ago, I think 0.6z will remain the most recent version for quite
a while)

So, once you've got that installed you can proceed to the
rest of the article.

I recommend editing the 'colors.h' file before installing,
otherwise the colors used will look really crappy.

Also I recommend taking a look at the examples that come with it
in the 'samples' directory. My scripts are based on them, just
that I improvised.

*** CONGRATULATIONS ***
You have managed to install dialog, this article is now over!

Ok, sorry about that ... it was meant as a joke, but it was,
I guess, just too cheasy. That's my humor for you...

While looking through some packages, I found this interesting
think called 'dialog' that was supposed to enable you to use
dialog boxes in shell scripts. Well, after playing around with
it for a while I decided to document it.

Here it is ...

I didn't get everything to work, maybe you can
though. So I'll just write about what I managed to get to 
run.

You can also sort of see this as a simple guide to shell scripting.

Let's start with taking a look at our options here ...
 
dialog version 0.62. Display dialog boxes from shell scripts *
 
Usage: dialog --clear
       dialog --create-rc <file>
       dialog [--title <title>] [--separate-output] [--backtitle <backtitle>] [-
-clear] <Box options>
 
Box options:
 
  --yesno <text> <height> <width>
  --msgbox <text> <height> <width>
  --infobox <text> <height> <width>
  --inputbox <text> <height> <width> [<init>]
  --textbox <file> <height> <width>
  --menu <text> <height> <width> <menu height> <tag1> <item1>...
  --checklist <text> <height> <width> <list height> <tag1> <item1> <status1>...
  --radiolist <text> <height> <width> <list height> <tag1> <item1> <status1>...
  --gauge     <text> <height> <width> <percent>    

Now guess how I got this.
Yes, exactly! I typed 'dialog' at my prompt =)

I recommend reading the manpage of dialog, too.
(man dialog ... stupid!)

There's the first options ...

dialog --clear 
I have not found any particular use in this

For some awkward reason I have never managed to get
dialog --create-rc <file> to work

dialog --title <title>
This just gives the dialog box a title.

dialog --seperate-output
This makes the output of a --checklist different

dialog --backtitle <backtitle>
This puts a neat-looking Title on the background

So, let's start with a msgbox as it is the easiest to use.
I'll use '$' as the prompt, because I am absolutely certain that you are not
leet enough to have the '#' prompt. 
$ dialog --msgbox 'Hello World!' 5 30

Now let's advance it to try out some different features
$ dialog --title 'My areet Hello World Program!' --msgbox 'Hello World!' 5 40

Make it even leeter
$ dialog --title 'My areet Hello World Program!' --backtitle 'b0g 0wnz!' 
  --msgbox 'Hello World!' 5 40 
(put that on one line)

Notice the differences?

Let's write a little script that uses the msgboxes we just learned about
and a yesno dialog box

Seeing as I'm a very religious person (LOL!) and I've been thinking about
death lately, I will use all sorts of weird examples with death, throughout
this sacred article. 

By the way, you may need to change those little numbers to fit your screen.

-----------------death--------------------------------------------------------
#!/bin/sh

if dialog --backtitle 'Death' --yesno 'Do you want to die?' 5 30
then
 dialog --backtitle 'Death' --msgbox 'Thanks! You will now die!' 5 30
else
 dialog --backtitle 'Death' --msgbox 'Die anyway, Biatch!' 5 30
fi

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Try it out ... quite areet, huh?
So, how does this work?
The yesno dialog box has an exit status of 0 if 'yes' is answered and
1 if 'no'.
so the if checks if the exit status is 0. If it is it puts a msgbox
saying 'Thanks! You will now die!'. If it doesn't return 0 it puts
a msgbox saying 'Die anyway, Biatch!' 

Well, also the yesno dialog box returns 255 if escape was pressed ...
but we don't want to get into that now. 

Actually ... I will give you an example (just to make this article seem longer, 
of course!):
----------------death_modified-----------------------------------------------
#!/bin/sh

dialog --backtitle 'Death' --yesno 'Do you want to die?' 5 30

case $? in
 0) 
  dialog --backtitle 'Death' --msgbox 'Thanks! You will now die!' 5 30
  ;;
 1)
  dialog --backtitle 'Death' --msgbox 'Die anyway, Biatch!' 5 30
  ;;
 255)
  dialog --backtitle 'Death' --msgbox 'Why did you Biatch press ESC? Die!' 5 40
  ;;
esac
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Yet again, very simple ... =)

$? is the last return value of a program by the way.

Next there's the infobox ... which really sucks.
Don't use the infobox unless you can get it to work properly.
The problem with it is that it doesn't wait for a confirmation (like you
pressing the 'Ok' Button), it just opens and closes. So you don't even
manage to see any of it.

Now comes the inputbox ... 
Let's try it out (wee, I love examples!)

-------------death_modified_yet_again--------------------------------------- 
#!/bin/sh
 
dialog --backtitle 'Death' --yesno 'Do you want to die?' 5 30
 
case $? in
 0)
  dialog --backtitle 'Death' --inputbox 'Please enter your name:' 8 30 2> 
/tmp/name.$$
   case $? in
    0)
     name=$(cat /tmp/name.$$)
     rm -rf /tmp/name.$$
     dialog --backtitle 'Death' --msgbox "Thanks! You will now die, $name!" 5 50
     ;;
    1)
     dialog --backtitle 'Death' --msgbox 'Die anyway, Biatch!' 5 30
     ;;
    255)
     dialog --backtitle 'Death' --msgbox 'DIE NOW BIATCH!!!' 5 30
     ;;
   esac
  ;;
 1)
  dialog --backtitle 'Death' --msgbox 'Die anyway, Biatch!' 5 30
  ;;
 255)
  dialog --backtitle 'Death' --msgbox 'DIE NOW BIATCH!!!' 5 30
  ;; 
esac
----------------------------------------------------------------------------- 

Next comes the textbox ...
Let's try it out with 2 examples

-------------death_file_1----------------------------------------------------
#!/bin/sh

cat << EOF > /tmp/death_file_1.$$

This is the Death-File

*SCROLL*

*SCROLL MORE*

*SCROLL FOREVER*

*SCROLL YET MORE*

*SCROLL MORE AND MORE*

*SCROLL*

*SCROLL*

*SCROLL*

*SCROLL*

*OK, ENOUGH SCROLL*

OOPS, YOU ARE DEAD NOW!

EOF

dialog --backtitle 'Death' --textbox "/tmp/death_file_1.$$" 8 30

rm -rf /tmp/death_file_1.$$
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

So, first this program uses what is called 'Here Document' (cat << EOF)
to cat text into /tmp/death_file_1.$$ ($$ is the pid of the current process)
and then it uses a textbox to show the just now generated text file.

------------death_file_2---------------------------------------------------
#!/bin/sh

if [ -z $1 ]
then
 echo "Usage: $0 <filename>"
 exit 0
fi

dialog --backtitle 'Death' --textbox "$1" 8 30
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

First of all let me explain the variables $0 and $1:
$0 is the program name, $1 is the first argument passed on the command line.
$2 the second, $3 the third ...

Then if [ -z $1 ] checks if $1 = 0;
If so, it tells the user the correct usage of the program.

so to use it you'd type:
$ ./death_file_2 <filename>

Next on the list are menu dialog boxes ...
So let's take a look at another leeto example =)

---------------death_menu--------------------------------------------------
 #!/bin/sh
 
dialog --backtitle 'Death' --menu "What Operating System do you use?" 20 50 12 
"Windows" "Bill Gate's Nasty Work" \
"Unix" "Unix or a Unix clone)" "Other" "Some other Operating System ..." 2> 
/tmp/death_menu.$$
 
case $? in
 0)
  OS=$(cat /tmp/death_menu.$$)
  rm -rf /tmp/death_menu.$$
  case $OS in
   "Windows")
    dialog --backtitle 'Death' --msgbox 'Go fuck Bill Gates ... no wait, DIE!!!' 
5 45
    ;;
   "Unix")
    dialog --backtitle 'Death' --menu "When do you want to die?" 20 50 12 "NOW!" 
"Die right now" \
    "Later!" "Die in a few seconds" "Never!" "Never die" 2> /tmp/death_menu.$$
     case $? in
      0)
       WHEN=$(cat /tmp/death_menu.$$)
       rm -rf /tmp/death_menu.$$
       case $WHEN in
        "NOW!")
         dialog --backtitle 'Death' --msgbox 'Thanks! You will now die!' 5 30
         ;;
        "Later!")
         sleep 3
         dialog --backtitle 'Death' --msgbox 'You had 3 seconds. Now, DIE!' 5 35
         ;;
        "Never!")
         dialog --backtitle 'Death' --msgbox 'DIE NOW BIATCH!!!' 5 30
         ;;
       esac
       ;;
      1)
       dialog --backtitle 'Death' --msgbox 'Die anyway, Biatch!' 5 30
       ;;
      255)
       dialog --backtitle 'Death' --msgbox 'DIE NOW BIATCH!!!' 5 30
       ;;
     esac
    ;;
   "Other")
    dialog --backtitle 'Death' --msgbox 'Hmm, just die!' 5 30
    ;;
  esac
  ;;
 1)
  dialog --backtitle 'Death' --msgbox 'Die anyway, Biatch!' 5 30 
  ;;
 255)
  dialog --backtitle 'Death' --msgbox 'DIE NOW BIATCH!!!' 5 30
  ;;
esac
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Ok, now that script is sooooo areet.
Try understanding it your self 'cause it's actually quite simple and
I'm too lazy to explain it now.

So, this now leaves us left with the checklist, radiolist and gauge
to explain. However, since I am lazy^H^H^H^H^H^H^Hwant to leave you some
challenges to solve on your own, I'll leave you to discover these marvelous
things. 

Maybe I'll put it in 'Leet Shell-Scripting Part Two'.
