                           LOD/H TECHNICAL JOURNAL

                                  INTRODUCTION
                                  -------------


We are still alive. This publication is not released on any schedule. Past
attempts at scheduling issues have failed miserably. The editors refuse to
release issues which are not up to our self-defined standards. We have in the
past, and will continue in the future, to accept articles from anyone (e.g.
non LOD) as long as the articles adhere to our basic format and style. The
editors review all articles to verify accuracy and integrity however it may
not be  possible in all cases to check every fact. Plagiarized material is not
acceptable and we make every attempt to verify an article's originality. When
referenced material is used, the source for that material must be clearly
stated. The more articles we receive the sooner each issue is released. There
is a minimum 2 month review and editing period for each article. If you want
to contribute articles contact any member and they will forward articles to
the editors.

There seems to be some confusion as to what writers are (or were) in LOD/H and
what ones aren't. JUST BECAUSE SOMEONE WRITES FOR THIS PUBLICATION DOES NOT
MEAN THEY ARE AN LOD/H MEMBER! Just to clear up any confusion, a current
member list follows:

Erik Bloodaxe
Lex Luthor
Prime Suspect
Phase Jitter
Professor Falken
Skinny Puppy

File 06: The History of LOD/H is a short article explaining the origin of the
group. We realize this is of interest to only a few, and most people probably
could care less. However, also included is a list of EVERY member who was ever
in the group. This is to clear up any and all misconceptions about members.
The press, telecommunications and computer security people, law enforcement,
and others can finally get their facts straight [See Issue #3, article 10,
Clearing up the mythical LOD/H Busts for a prime example, and also in the
Network News and Notes section -- first two articles regarding more so called
'LOD BUSTS']. Another purpose is to thwart would-be group impostors. SYSOPS
who give system access to individuals solely because they are a member of some
respected group are urged to verify the hacker's identity as best they can. No
one should be taken on their word alone.

This issue is dedicated to the three (now "retired") members who recently
received visits from our friends and yours, the U.S. Secret Service and
Bell South Security: The Leftist, The Urvile, and The Prophet. Again, see
the Network News and Notes section for the stories.
Although the TJ is distributed to many boards, the inability for any decent
board to consistently remain online prevents us from utilizing "sponsor"
boards as distribution hubs. Therefore, the TJ will be distributed to whatever
boards are around at the time of release. Due to the lack of boards the
newsletter will be distributed in diskette form to those who can help in its
distribution.
