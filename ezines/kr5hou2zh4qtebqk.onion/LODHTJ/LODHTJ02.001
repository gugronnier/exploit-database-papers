                           LOD/H TECHNICAL JOURNAL
                           -----------------------


                               INTRODUCTION:



     This is issue #2, we had originally planned to put out 6 issues a year,
but it looks as if this will become a quarterly newsletter instead. This is due
to the fact that the articles take months to fully research, write, and edit.
By year end, we hope to show that we are not a "fly-by-night" newsletter and
will continue to provide you with the same level of information, accuracy, and
originality as this issue and the first. We appreciate those who have been
downloading, storing, and distributing the newsletter in its entirety, and hope
this will continue, as it benefits everyone.


     Here is the breakdown of this issue: 1 article on Telecommunications,
4 articles on Datacommunications, and one article in the 'other' category. Two
authors have written articles for Issue 1, and 5 are new. Obviously this Issue
is more hacking related, whereas Issue 1 was more phreaking related. If you
have any material which may be of interest, let us know.


     Our 'sponsor' BBS list has been shortened to one dependable board, as
Metal Shop Private, Shadowspawn, Hell Prozen Over, The Private Sector and
Atlantis have all gone down, though some may be back online in the future. Left
is Digital Logic. The usernumber/usernames for DL follows for those who wish to
get in contact with us. We are open to suggestions for more Sponsor Boards.

One last note, a slight clarification on articles. Articles labeled with
letters, ie: Part A & Part B as in last issue's articles on the Outside Loop
Distribution Plant by Phucked Agent 04 and the LOH Telenet Directory along with
this issue's article on Hacking CMS by Lex Luthor are intended to be complete
articles in themselves and should be merged together. They were broken up for
editing and transmission purposes. Articles labeled as Part 1 & Part 2, are
separate articles based on the same subject.
