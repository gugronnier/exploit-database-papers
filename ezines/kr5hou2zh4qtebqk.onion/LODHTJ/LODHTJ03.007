				  IRIS
		<INTERACTIVE REAL TIME INFORMATION SYSTEM>

    Iris is an operating system which most people have heard little or nothing
about.	Many Businesses across the country are starting to use computers which
support the IRIS operating system. IRIS is not new though, it was originally
written to run on PDP-11, Data General, and Royal Systems.  IRIS has grown in
popularity due to the major revisions which have been made over the years and
is a fairly easy system for anyone to learn.  This article, though not a
complete guide to IRIS, will give you the basic knowledge neccesary to
identify, enter, and access information once in.


Finding IRIS
------------

    You'll know you've found an IRIS system by its login banner, which usually
looks like this:

Welcome to "IRIS" R9.1.4 timesharing

This is Dr. BOB'S OFFICE!

ACCOUNT ID?


Logging in
----------

    To log into an IRIS system after connecting <at 7E1 usually> press the
escape key.  You should get a message asking for account ID at which point you
would enter your ID followed by a c/r.	You're in the system when you get a #
prompt.  If you've entered an incorrect ID, the normal error message would be:

INVALID

    The nice thing about IRIS from a hacker point of view is that it will allow
you to brute force hack your way in, never keeping a log of unsuccessful
tries, and never hanging up on you.
    If you don't think your ID is being entered properly, you can turn the
echo back on by first hitting a Control-E. If you suspect parity trouble on
your login <ie: the E key beeps every time you hit it> try hitting a Control-P
to change the parity.

Default Accounts
----------------

Try the account names below, and also try them with 1 or 2 spaces after them in
upper and lower case.


ACCOUNT 	       COMMENTS 		     Privelege level
DDDDDDD       DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD	DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD
MANAGER       < works 99% of the time > 	3     full system priv's

BOSS	      < manager account       > 	3     full system priv's

SOFTWARE      < software dept account > 	2     general user access

DEMO	      < demonstration account > 	1     scum of the earth priv's

PDP8	      < always on rev 7.0     > 	3     full system priv's

PDP11	      < always on rev 7.0     > 	3     full system priv's

ACCOUNTING    < accounting dept.      > 	2     general user

     Also try the company's name, or its intials.  Sometimes system operators
place control characters in their ID's, or spaces <usually one, sometimes two>
at the end of their account names, this security 'trick' is used due to the
operating system not asking for passwords. Like PRIMOS version 18 systems, all
you needed was a valid username to get in. There are plans of implementing
passwords in the future for IRIS.


YOU'RE IN!
----------

So you're in- hopefully with full priv's.

    The users Privilege Level may be 0, 1, 2, or 3 indicating General,
Privileged, Manager, or Superuser privileges respectively. Only the Superuser
account can access the ACCOUNTS file, but all level two accounts are given
most other privileges that a level 3 account have.

    If you were able to log in with a privilege level of 3, you'll be allowed
to run the program ACCOUNTUTILITY or ACCOUNTS, depending on the version of
IRIS is running.  This is almost always found on LU 0, along with all the
other system utilities.  ACCOUNTUTILITY is menu driven, and you should have no
problem using it.

Accounts File
-------------

The Accounts File contains the following information

Account ID
Assigned priority
Assigned Logical Unit #
Account# <Group and User>
Alloted CPU time <in seconds>
Alloted disk blocks
Number of disk blocks in use
Peak # of disk blocks in use
Net File Charges


ACCOUNTUTILITY
--------------

    This program is for editing the accounts on the system.  You must be a
manager on the system <level 3> to run this program, or else have a way to
change the protection of BOTH the accounts file, and the ACCOUNTUTILITY
program.  If this is done, anyone can run the program.	After typing
ACCOUNTUTILITY you'll get the following menu:

ACCOUNTS FILE MAINTENANCE  REV 2.2

(0) EXIT TO SYSTEM
(1) ADD NEW ACCOUNT
(2) MODIFY ACCOUNT
(3) DELETE ACCOUNT
(4) INQUIRE ACCOUNT
(5) LIST THE ACCOUNTS

ENTER FUNCTION NUMBER:

It's all pretty straightforward, I don't think I need to go on about this
feature...

What to do Inside
-----------------

    The first thing you want to do once inside IRIS is to issue the command PP
which will show you who's on, and what they're currently doing.  Sometimes PP
has been renamed to PORT ALL MONITOR. If you logged in and it said your
Logical Unit was not active, you must install the system under the MANAGER
account.  To do this, log in on a full privs account, and type IN, INSTALL, or
FASTINSTALL.  This should allow you to activate all the system's Logical
Units.	Normally, the Logical Units (referred to as LU's) range from 0-99, 99
being a ramdrive.  If you choose to just install Logical Unit number one, the
command would be INSTALL 0.1 and so on.  If you are told Logical Unit x
exists, change? DO NOT CHANGE IT!  Instead, attempt to install a Logical Unit
that doesn't already exist.

To list all the files on the Logical Unit assigned to your account, type LIBR.
To list only certain files type LIBR x where x = searchcriteria.
To list the files on another LU, type LIBR x/ where x = the LU number.
To list all the files that you have read access to, type LIBR @.
To list only files that belong to you, type LIBR @g,r where g is your group,
   and u is your user #.
To list files accessed within h hours, type LIBR >h where h is a decimal #.

Anyway, you'll see something like this:

#LIBR

LOGICAL UNIT #0       JUL 30, 1988  19:50:03

* FILENAME[VOL]  PROT	COST  SIZE  ACCOUNT  AGE  HSLA	TYPE  PRIV  HBA
S  ASM		  33   $0.00	11    0, 1  11068 11068  401   3    400
B  RUN		  33   $0.00	21    0, 1  11068     0  602   3    344
T  SU.DSUBS	  22   $0.00	22    0, 1  11068     5   30   3      7

and so on....

Running Programs
----------------

    Most Application Software for IRIS is written in business basic, which is
basic with extended functions specifically for business applications.

To execute a runnable file at the # prompt, just type the file's name.
To exit into basic, just type BASIC.
To run a program, simply type its name.
To load a program type BASIC LOAD x where x = filename.
To list a program once in basic, type X LIST X where, in both cases X = the
   line you want to list or simply type LIST to list all the lines of the
   program.

		    File Type Chart

Number	      Letter		     File Type

0		P		Permanent System File
1		S		System processor or file
2		B		BASIC processor or program
3		A		Stand alone processor or program
4		X		EXECUTE processor or program
5		G		GPM program
6		M		MUMPS processor or program
7		W		COURSE WRITER processor or program
20		Q		Stand alone compiler
21		J		Stand alone relocating assembler
22		L		Stand alone relocatable loader
23		R		Relocatable binary object tape image
24		I		Indexed relocatable binary library
27		Z		Temporary file
30		T		Text file
31		F		Formatted data file
32		C		Contiguous data file
36		$		Peripheral device driver

Passworded Files
----------------

    Sometimes a password will be added to the end of a file name to limit
access to users who have knowledge of the password.  To access a passworded
file, type the following: FILEX ^Epass^E

The ^E is correctly represented as Control-E.  The common defaults for
passworded files <especially on LU0> are the letter X and the word THINK.


Kicking Users off the System
----------------------------

    This is something you do not want to do unless an emergency situation
arises, in which case you would issue the PPP command. This is the port
eviction utility.  It will then ask you which port you would like to evict or
you may type the word ALL to evict everyone but yourself.  This is useful if
you hang a printer port, or are afraid you may have dumped data to a printer
which is offline.


PORT.STAT
---------

    This command gives you the status of a given port, and its channels. to
run it type:

PORT.STAT


PP
--

    PP lets you see who is on the system, what port they're on, what baud rate
they're running, and what process they're running. Just type PP from the #
prompt. IRIS will give you information about the ports on the system and then
will ask you if you would like channel status. Either type in the channel that
you wish to see the status of, or hit return to exit.


GAMES
-----

    Yes, there are even games on IRIS, all the old PDP games hunt the wumpus,
tic-tac-toe, etc...sure to provide hours of amusement.


Changing the Baud Rate of a Port
--------------------------------

    To change a port's baud rate, type PORT BAUD x where x is a standard baud
rate <110,300,600,1200,2400,9600,19200>.  Don't change the baud rate of the
port you are on. This command is useful for temporarily disabling a user.


Copying Files
-------------

    Copy is a general purpose command for moving data of any type from a
specified source to a specified destination.  Also, data from several sources
can be merged into one destination file.

The general form of the copy command is:

Copy dest = Source1,Source2   etc....

Where dest is the filename under which the destination file is to be built.


Mail
----

To mail a one line message to another port, the following command applies:

MAIL p "Hello My name is Joe Comosolo" where p =  the port # to mail to.


Loading Text Files
------------------

A text file can be loaded by use of the command:

EDIT SFILE,DFILE
an exclamation mark must be used to copy over an existing file.

A new text file may be created by typing:
EDIT,Filename

If you just want to examine a text file, then just type
EDIT Filename

Some systems also have the TYPE filename command.


BYELOG
------

This command allows you to edit the login message you receive before you are
prompted for your account id.  The syntax is:

BYELOG message to be printed


Logging Off
-----------

>From the # prompt, type BYE and hit return.
