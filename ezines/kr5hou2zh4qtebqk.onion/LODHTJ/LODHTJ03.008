     In this file I will attempt to give a basic overview of how various
central offices handle coin service.  If you feel your interest grows due to
this file there are other good technical documents about coin service, i.e.
Bell System Practices, CDs, PDs ect..


     Coin service is differentiated from other services by a special class of
service.  All switching systems give -48 volt battery toward the coin phone on
the ring side of the line.  Coin-First lines have an open TIP during a normal
receiver-on-hook condition.  When a line goes off hook the central office
takes no action and in fact can not detect the off hook condition due to the
line's conditioning-for-ground start.   When the customer deposits money the
coin ground is extended to the ring side of the line. The ground signals the
line equipment in the central office as a to give a dial tone.
     Dial-Tone First offices give both the battery and ground to the coin
station, thus providing a dial tone equivalent to a POTS phone.  All coin
service is super current sensitive. (The central office must give at least 23
milliamps of line current and 41 milliamps of coin control current to the
farthest coin station.)


     The switching systems differ in the method which calls are handled.


No. 5 Crossbar

     The No. 5 crossbar coin-first offices must have a dual wound line relay
with both windings in series when dealing with a coin first situation.	If any
Coin-First lines are served in a No. 5 crossbar office the originating
registers must be able to desensitize the (pulsing) L relay by providing a
resistive ground throgh its tertiary winding via the coin class of service
relay.
     Crossbar offices can give coin return from Originating Registers,
TSPS/Cordboard trunks, Ring and Tone trunks, Announcement trunks, and Coin
Supervisory circuits.  Coin collect current is only given through
TSPS/Cordboard trunks and Coin Supervisory circuits.  The only circuit that
can handle a stuck coin test is the coin supervisory circuit.
     Crossbar offices handle coin actions on locally completed calls in the
coin supervisory circuit (CS).	All trunks must have access to the CS circuit
or use coin junctors or coin 1A0 trunks that have such access.	The use of
coin junctors or coin 1A0 trunks elimnate the need for other trunks to be hard
wired to the Coin Supervisory Link.  When the trunk's supervisory relays show
a coin action is needed the trunk searches for an idle Coin Supervisory
Circuit through the Coin Supervisory Link.  The bridged connection allows the
Coin Supervisory Circuit to give the proper collect or return current toward
the coin telephone and test to see if the action was successful.
     Crossbar offices handle coin actions required by DDD calls or TSPS
operators in the No. 5 crossbar TSPS trunk.  The TSPS base unit signals the
No. 5 office by either frequencies or multiwinks.  The No. 5 office receives
these signals and the trunk applies one pulse of coin collect or return or
ring back.  The No. 5 TSPS trunk dose not make a test to see if the required
coin action is successful.  If the coin is still present the call is dropped
and the coin remains in the trap.


ESS

     ESS offices provide all coin control actions from the Coin Control
Circuit.  The Coin Control Circuit is switched to a customers line under
program control.  The Coin Control Circuits always make a stuck coin test at
the end of a call.
     ESS offices handle coin actions required by DDD or TSPS operators by
scanning the TSPS trunk looking for any control signals from the TSPS base
unit.  When the ESS office sees a request on the TSPS trunk the ESS office
opens the talking path and attaches a multifrequency (MF) reciever.  The MF
reciever looks at the tones being sent from the TSPS base unit transmitter and
checks if the signal requested is a  coin collect, coin return, ring back, or
operator attached.
     Dial-Tone First (DTF) offices not equipped with expanded In-Band
Signaling give +48V talk battery during operator attached and 48V talk
batttery during the rest of the call.  If the TSPS signals for coin return the
ESS office will open the talk path again, release the MF receiver and switch
the line to the Coin Control Circuit which applies  -130V  coin return
potential.  After the coin control function is finished the system will make
on recycle attempt if the coin ground is still present.
     Local calls are handled within the ESS machine.  When a coin control
function is required the program momentarily opens the talk path and switches
the line to a Coin Control C  cuit which applies the required current.

Step By Step
     Coin lines in a Step By Step area are served on dedicated Line Finder
groups.  The Line Finders are hardwired to a coin box trunk and then cabled to
a first selector appearance.
     Step By Step offices can give coin return from coin box trunks,
TSPS/Cordboard trunks, and other miscellaneous trunks. (My knowledge of Step
By Step is vague, it's kind of like trying to research dinosaurs.)
     Step By Step offices handle coin actions on local calls in the coin box
trunks.  The coin box trunk applies the coin control current through the
winding of a relay to the coin station hopper trigger ground.	When the coin
station ground disappears, the coin box trunk relay releases and allows the
connection to restore to normal.  Some Step By Step offices have a timed
release circuit that will time out after about eight attempts of coin control
action, peg the stuck coin register, then release.  If the timed release
circuit is not provided and a coin ground can not be removed, the circuit must
be manually released.
     Step By Step offices handle coin actions required by DDD calls or TSPS
operators in the Step By Step TSPS trunk.  The TSPS base unit signals the Step
office by either frequencies or multiwinks.  The Step office trunk recicves
these signals and trunk applies one pulse of coin collect, coin return or ring
back.  The trunk does not make a test to see if the action was successful.
     If a DDD call was completed to a busy number the Step By Step TSPS trunk
will apply one quick pu  e of coin return toward the coin station,  then the
coin box will check to see if the coin ground has disappeared.	If the ground
is still present the coin box trunk will repeat the attempt to collect the
coin.


     If you have any further questions about how the central  office handles
coin service or about coin service in general, I can be reached via E-mail on
