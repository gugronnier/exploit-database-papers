     In this article I will discuss the basic layout description, and use of
the keys, found on the standard AT&T 100-B TSPS Console. Possible uses for the
information contained herein (besides for just wanting to know about the TSPS
Console) are primarily for social engineering purposes. The more you know about
operators and their jobs, the more you can get them to do things for you...

                     Figure 1. 100-B TSPS Console layout

       (Due to 80 col width, picture is a little distorted vertically)
Legend:
         o Abbreviations in all capital letters are ILLUMINATED KEYS
         o Abbreviations in all lower case letters are NON-ILLUMINATED KEYS
         o Abbreviations in upper & lower case letters are LAMPS ONLY

 ie: VFY = Lighted VERIFY key, tim = Unlighted TIME key, Cg = CALLING Lamp

--  Above is the standard AT&T 100-B console layout, while there may be
additional or different keys on the various  consoles, they will generally
resemble the above layout closely.  In the lower right hand corner you will
notice the numbers 0-9 laid out into what resembles a keypad, this is exactly
what it appears to be. The TSPS Operator uses this keypad for keying in not
only routing information (Phone numbers, Inward routings, etc..) but as a multi
purpose tool for entering various numeric codes recognized by the TSPS software
itself. Routing information applied onto the trunks from the TSPS position is
of course in MF (Multi-Frequency). When a TSO keys in a number or routing, the
console buffers the KP+INFORMATION DIGITS until the ST key is pressed, at which
time it plays the buffered KP+INFO DIGITS+ST onto the trunk in a uniformly
spaced sequence. So if you were somehow able to listen in on a TSO actually
routing a call, it would not sound like someone placing a call on a standard
Touch-Tone telephone (or homemade blue box), but more like someone pressing a
"Redial key" on a Touch-Tone (TT) phone. The duration of the tone and space
between the tones are a network-wide standard, although the network in most
cases is quite tolerant to deviations of this standard. (This "loose" tolerance
is what allows us to simulate In-band signalling with our blue boxes).

--   At the upper left hand side of the diagram you will see the Ticket box,
This box has 4 slots marked New, Cancel, Scratch and Completed. I believe this
is used for manually filled out trouble and/or time tickets. As far as I know
manually filled time tickets are a thing of the past, however in case of
equipment failure the tickets are available I assume.  TSO would manually fill
out a trouble ticket to report trouble reaching a number out of her LAN (Local
Area Network - or, The area directly served by her particular TSPS position),
whereas to report trouble with a number in her LAN she would simply key in a
trouble code (utilizing the KP-TRBL (Trouble) key). to automatically place a
trouble report.

--   To the right of the Ticket box you will see the DISPLAY. The display works
in conjunction with certain keys on the console, and is used to display timing
information (hours, mins, sec's), Cost per minute, Calling number
identification (what most people refer to as TSPS ANI), numbers called, and
various special codes. The console display can be in one of two states, either
1) displaying digits, or 2) displaying nothing (dark). Both of which have
different meanings when resulting from certain procedures attempted by a TSO.
LIGHTED KEYS, and LAMPS on the console can be in one of three states either 1)
NOT ILLUMINATED (dark), 2) ILLUMINATED, or 3) FLASHING. Again the state of a
lamp/lamp-key meaning different things under different conditions.


II.                        KEY DESCRIPTIONS & USES
                           =======================

--   Below the Ticket box you will see a row of 5 keys starting with the key
labeled "VFY" (Verify), these are various special purpose keys used by TSPS
that have no real "grouping" unlike the other "Key groups". These are:

(VFY) - Verify, Illuminated key. Used in conjunction with the keypad, allows
the TSO to verify (listen in) on a telephone call that is in progress, although
any conversation taking place on that call is scrambled to the TSO, and despite
popular belief THE SCRAMBLING PROCESS IS DONE AT THE CONSOLE LEVEL, AND NOT ON
THE TRUNK LEVEL, SO FOR THOSE OF YOU WHO SEEN REFERENCE TO THE "BLV SCRAMBLING
SHUT OFF TONE" PLEASE IGNORE IT, IF YOU WERE TO SOMEHOW GAIN ACCESS TO A
VERIFICATION TRUNK FROM A NON-TSPS POSITION, THE CONVERSATION WOULD NOT BE
SCRAMBLED.


(OVR SES) - Over Seas, Illuminated key. Used in overseas call completion
through an Overseas Toll Completion Center/Server (IOCC). I believe it also
allows the TSO to key in more than 10 digits (standard POTS) for IDDD call
completion.

(SCN) - Screen, Illuminated key - Lights to notify TSO that incoming call has
an associated screening code, (ie: 74=collect calls only, 93=special billing).
Depressing this key causes the code to show on display, and it's up to the TSO
to decipher the code and explain its meaning to the customer if he/she is
attempting something forbidden by his associated screening code. (ie: Prison
phones have a screening code of 74, allowing them to place collect calls only.)

(INW) - Inward, Illuminated key - Lights to notify the TSO that the incoming
call is "Operator to Operator", therefore she answers by pressing the key and
answering "Inward!". In most cases Inward Operators are actually TSPS, with
their INWARD lamps lit.

(EMR INT) - Emergency Interrupt, Illuminated key. Used in conjunction with
the VFY key, to interrupt a call in progress while a line Verification is being
done, pressing this key causes an audible "beep" to be applied to the line, and
de-activates the console scrambling (for roughly 30 seconds) , allowing the TSO
to talk to the parties being verified/interrupted. Use of this key & the VFY
key, is constantly kept track of via various security & maintenance TTY's and
any abuse/misuse will set off alarms.

--   To the right of the above set of keys you will see three groups of
LAMPS/Keys labled "Non-coin", "Coin 1", and "Hotel".  The TSO utilizes the
condition of these lamps to identify the status of incoming calls. There are
three lamps that are common to each of the three groups, these are: "Sta",
"0+", and "0-" their meaning is identical in each case as you will see below.

(Sta) - Lamp, NON-COIN STA lamp lights when a non-coin caller requires TSPS
assistance in placing an otherwise direct-dialable call (in some rural areas
that have limited DDD features).  COIN STA lamp lights on direct dialed coin
calls that are sent to TSPS for payment collection. HOTEL STA lights on Hotel
originated DDD calls, TSPS also receives room number call is being originated
from.

(0+) - Lamp, Lights to signify that the incoming call was originated by a
customer dialing a "0+telephone number" for an operator assisted call in each
of the three groups (coin, non-coin, hotel/motel).  (ie. if a customer were to
place a "person to person (op assisted) call from a payphone, this would cause
the "0+" lamp in the "coin" group to light, one placed from a residential phone
would cause the "0+" lamp in the "non-coin" group to light, etc..)

(0-) - aka "Dial Zero", Lamp. Lights to signify that the incoming call was
originated by a customer simply dialing 0 (zero), in each of the three
categories (non-coin, coin, hotel/motel).

(PST PAY) - Post Pay, Illuminated key. Coin group only, Depressed by TSPS when
a customer requests a "post pay" call from a payphone, allowing him to deposit
the full charge at the completion of the call.

(Tne) - Tone, Lamp. I believe this lamp lights to inform the TSO that a coin
customer has flashed his/her switchook during a call in progress, requesting
operator assistance, although I'm not positive of this.

(GST) - Guest, Illuminated key lights on all hotel originated calls.

--   Below the above rows of keys and to the far left you will see a row of
keys labled "Outgoing Trunks". TSPS utilizes this group of keys to select
various outgoing trunk groups the keys are used as follows:

(DA) - Directory Assistance, Illuminated key. Used by TSO to place calls to the
directory assistance group.

(R&R) - Rate & Route, Illuminated key. Used to place calls to rate and route, I
believe TSPS now goes to the Universal Rate and Route position known to all you
boxers to be found at KP+800+141+1212+ST.

(SWB) - Switchboard, Illuminated key. I believe this key is used to reach a
cord-board position, although I have no evidence of this.

(OGT) - Outgoing Trunk, Illuminated key. Depressed by TSO to select an outgoing
trunk to be used to place operator assisted calls, special purpose calls (ie.
Inward), etc..

--   To the right of this row of keys you will find the group labled "Ring",
these keys are utilized by TSPS to activate special purpose ring features and
line handling.

(BAK) - Ring Back, Illuminated key. Used by TSO to ring the originating party's
line while holding the forward line in the event that the originating party
looses his connection

(FWD) - Ring Forward, Illuminated Key. Exactly the opposite of ring back.

(CAL BAK) - Call Back, Illuminated key. Used in special operator call back
situations on person to person calls where the called party is not available
but a message is left anyway, I really don't understand it's full potential and
most positions I have spoken with don't either.

(T&C) - Time and Charges, Illuminated key.

(Nfy) - Lamp.  Used in Non-ACTS (Automatic Coin Toll Service) originated calls,
lights to inform TSPS to notify caller of expiration if initial n minute period
(n = number of minutes entered via the KP NFY key at the origination of the
call).

(Chg Due) - Lamp. Lights to inform TSO that more money is needed at the
completion of a TSO assisted coin call, the usual procedure is to ring the coin
station back and attempt to frighten the customer into making the proper
deposit ("If you don't pay we'll bill the called party...").

(Key Clg) - Key Calling, Lamp. This lamp is used by TSPS to determine the
status of an incoming "Operator Number Identification" (ONI) marked caller or
an incoming caller that was routed to TSPS due to an "ANI Failure" (ANIF) Both
call conditions come to as a "0+" call (hotel, non-coin, coin - see above), if
the calling party is marked as "ONI Required" the appropriate "0+" lamp will
light, and the "Key Calling" lamp will be LIT STEADY. If the incoming call was
due to an ANIF, the "0+" lamp will be lit, and the "Key Calling" lamp will be
LIT & FLASHING.

--   Directly to the right of the "Ring" group of key's you will find the
RELEASE set of key's, these two Illuminated key's allow the TSO to selectively
release (disconnect from) either the calling, or called parties by pressing
either the "Release Back" (BAK), or "Release Forward" (FWD) key respectively.

--   To the right of the release set, you will see a group of four key's with
no particular "group designation", these again are various multi-purpose key's
that serve the following:

(SR) - Service (assistance) Required, Illuminated Key. Pressed by TSO to
Forward calling party to a supervisory console (ie. Irate Customers demanding
supervisor), can also be used if she is confused and needs assistance.

(MB) - Make Busy, Illuminated key. Used to "Busy out" her console, lights when
pressed, console will not take any incoming calls until it is pressed again.
(ie: Useful when gabbing, doing nails, or filling out time/trouble tickets).

(Mt) - Maintenance, Lamp. This lamp Illuminates to warn the TSO that her
console has been placed into remote maintenance/testing mode.  A flashing MTNC
lamp indicates a faulty console.

(PT) - Position Transfer, Illuminated Key. A TSO depresses this key to transfer
the call in progress from her console (position) to another console.

--   Below the "Outgoing Trunk" keygroup, you will see a Lamp marked "Cw" Call
Waiting - This lamp lights on every active console to inform a TSO that there
are incoming calls waiting.

--   To the far right of the "Cw" lamp, you will find the AMA group of keys,
broken into two sub-groups, which are "Station" and "Person", a complete
description of each key in this group would require more room than I have
available here, so if there's sufficient interest I will devote another article
to the use of these key's.  Basically these key's are used in conjunction with
the "KP" and "AMA Timing" groups of key's (see below), for attaching the
appropriate class of charge to the call being originated. The keys in the
"Station" sub-class from left to right are "Paid" (PA), which is used to attach
a "Station to Station" originating caller paid class of charge, "Collect" (COL)
to attach "Station to Station" Collect Call. "Special Calling" (SP CG), and
"Special Called" (SC CD) which are both used in "Special" Station to Station
billing procedures, such as third party, or credit card calls. "Auto Collect"
(AT CT), used in coin billing procedures and "Direct Distance Dialing" (DDD),
Attaches a DDD class of charge in cases where you have trouble dialing a number
and require operator assistance in completing a call.  Below this row of keys
you will find the "Person" sub-group of AMA keys, their uses are identical to
those in the "Station to Station" group only they attach a "Person to Person"
rate of charge. The "No AMA" (NO AMA), key is pressed to eliminate a charge for
a person to person call where the called party is unavailable.  Although all
the key's in this group can take on different meanings under different
conditions, the above definitions are suitable for the sake of this article.
All key's in this group are Illuminated keys.

--   Below the "Cw" lamp you will find two keys under the heading "Coin 2",
their uses on "Coin originated (payphone)" calls are: "Coin Collect" (COL) -
which causes the payphone to collect coin, and the "Coin Return" (RET), causes
it to return a coin. Both are Illuminated Key's.

--   To the right of the "Coin 2" group, you will find the "AMA Timing" group.
These key's are used in conjunction with the "AMA", and "KP" groups for:

(CA TMG) - Cancel Timing, Illuminated Key. Cancels AMA timing charges and also
allows TSO to change the class of charge on a call.

(ST TMG) - Start Timing, Illuminated Key. Used to start AMA timing after
appropriate class of charge has been entered, and the calling party has reached
the called party in person to person calls (or in station to station DDD calls,
destination ring has been established).

(CA CAL) - Cancel Call, Illuminated Key. Used in conjunction with the Cancel
Timing key to Cance&2cP"qcall and mark a "NON-COMPLETED" call on the AMA tapes
(ie. A person to person call where the called party is not available).

(REC MSG) - Record (AMA) Message, Illuminated Key. Used at the completion of
(completion meaning calling & called party are done talking), to record the
time of the call and the appropriate class of charge onto the AMA tapes and
releases their forward connection. --   To the right of the AMA timing group
you will see three columns of four buttons under the heading of Loop Control.
These allow the TSO to access any of the three loops available to her for
placing calls. The keys have identical meaning in each set they are used in the
following manner:


(CLG) - Calling Party, Lamp. Lights to signify person on said loop is a calling
party.

(CLD) - Called Party, Lamp. Lights to signify that person on loop is a called
party.

(HLD) - Hold, Illuminated key. Places a loop into a hold state, the calling and
called party can talk to each other, and AMA timing can be started. The call is
held at the console.

(ACS) - Access, Illuminated key. Used by TSO to initially access a loop.
Pressing this key selects an outgoing loop, and readies the console for placing
a call onto it. It is also used to allow TSO back into a loop(s) in a HOLD
state.

--   To the right of the loop control group you will see the "Keypulse Key"
group, these key's are pressed by the TSO to initialize the keypad parser into
the proper mode for entering information, which is completed/entered by
pressing the ST (START) key (to right of keypad). Their uses are as follows:

(KP TB) - KP Trouble, Illuminated key. Used to enter various TSO encountered
trouble codes such as noisy line, customer(s) were cut off, couldn't complete
call, etc. I believe the format for entering a trouble code is as follows: "KP
TBL + TC + NTE + CN + ST" where KP TBL = KP Trouble Key, TC = 2 Digit Trouble
code, NTE = Number of times Trouble was encountered (1 Digit), CN = Callers
(phone) Number, and ST = the START key. a record of the trouble is made on the
AMA tapes and the calling party is usually given credit.

(KP RT) - KP Rate, Illuminated. Used to enter and display Rate (Charge)
information. Can also be used to display rate information at a customer
request.

(KP HO) - KP Hotel, Illuminated Key. Used for manually entering a verbally
requested room number on  Hotel/Motel originated calls.

(KP NY) - KP Notify, Illuminated key. Used for entering time in Minutes on a
NON-ACTS originated Coin call, when entered time duration is up, it causes the
NFY Lamp (See above) to Flash.

(KP SP) - KP Special, Illuminated Key. Used for entering Special numbers such
as credit card id's and third party billing numbers, causes TSPS software to
automatically query the BVA (Billing Validation) database to check validity of
number/CC, will flash if billing to an illegal card or number is attempted.

(KP BK) - KP Back, Illuminated Key. Used in entering the calling number in ANI
failures (ANIF), and ONI (Operator Number Identification) required situations.

(KP FD) - KP Forward, Illuminated. Most commonly used KP Key. Used to enter
called party's number on all TSO assisted calls. Pressing the ST (START) key
causes the entered number to be applied onto the accessed trunks in MF.

(ST) - Start, Illuminated Key (Found to the right of the keypad). Used in
completing all KP+number sequences listed above.

-- Below the "Coin 2" set of key's you will see the (POS RLS) - Position
Release key, this key is used by the TSO to release her position from the call.
She would hit POS RLS after completing a call, and also to release a person
calling to ask her questions and not actually requesting a call be placed (ie.
Name/place requests, etc..)

-- Below the Position Release key you will see a set of 5 key's labeled
"Display Control", these key's are used to make the console display show
various information. Their use is as follows:


(TIM) - Time, Unlighted Key. Displays time of day in Military format.

(CHG MIN) - Charge per Minute, Unlighted Key. Displays the $ charge per minute
on a call in progress.

(CLG NUM) - Calling Number, Illuminated Key. Displays the number of the calling
party.

(CLD NUM) - Called number, Illuminated Key. Displays the number of the called
party.

(SPL NUM) - Special Number, Illuminated Key. Display's various special numbers
such as Calling Card numbers, and third party billed numbers. Use of this key
in displaying Calling Card numbers is as follows:  Press it once you get first
10 digits of 16 digit Calling Card, press it a second time and get the second 6
digits of the Calling Card, press it again and it darkens the display.

-- That's it for the key's on the console, on the left hand side of the diagram
you will see the "Multi Leaf Bulletin Tray", this is an all purpose holder for
information leaflets that contain information on special numbers, Rate & Route
information, special non-standard assistance routes, and various other TSPS
related information. At the lower right hand side of the console is the "Number
Plate", this is simply the console's Position number and ID number. It is a
stamped metal plate, I haven't figured out any way to abuse it yet, other than
scaring a TSO by knowing of it's existence.

** That's about it for this article, if there is sufficient interest in TSPS I
will write further articles with more detail on the actual procedures used by
the TSPS operator in call handling and such, I will also be writing an article
on the BOC TOPS (Toll Operator Position Service) operators that have begun to
pop up since the divestiture when I get some better information on the position
itself. It seems that AT&T inwards no longer handle only long distance
assistance in TOPS services areas and the TOPS op's handle all local area
assistance.

Until then, Dial with Care.
