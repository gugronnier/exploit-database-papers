				INTROUCTION:


    When putting together a high quality newsletter, it is sometimes difficult
to locate suitable articles and arrange with the author for transmission.
Difficulties of this type have caused this issue to be almost one year late.
All of the older articles have been updated to insure the latest, most
accurate information.

2600 Magazine update:

    Lex Luthors' Hacking IBM VM/CMS Systems article from Issue 2 has been
published in the November/December issue of 2600 of 1987.  Phucked Agent 04's
article on the Outside Loop Distribution Plant has been published in the
Fall/88 issue.	This brings the total up to 5 articles from the LOD/H
Technical Journal that they have published.  The others were CLASS by The
Videosmith, the TSPS Console by The Marauder, and Update #4 of the LOH Telenet
Directory. To subscribe to 2600, which is published quarterly contact:
