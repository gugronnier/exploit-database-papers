  3. What is a Rogue
     I have  gotten  this  question  alot  ever since I started the group IRG,
     so after a while I decided  that I need to get somethin' strait...What is
     a Rogue.  Well it all started way  back when I  had just got my modem and
     had  started  to  pirate  games,  I had pirated games  for a while when I 
     to phone phreak.  And now I have started to hack.  So when people ask  me 
     what I do I have to say I am a pirate that  is also a phrack(phreak+hack)
     but I also box. Well I said PHUCK that, so I decided that there needed to
     be  a  word  for  a person who does just about everything possible on the 
     computer and out  of the computer field.  So I thought of the word Rogues
     and then the Guild came to me.  So I started IRG...             
                                                                     - Haywire
  
  4. What is IRG
     IRG is a collection of computer users who decided they should pool  their 
     skills  in  various areas to form a group which will help to  inform  the 
     elite computing community.  We are a new group and would probably benefit 
     from  any criticism/comments you may have about the group.  If you  think 
     you  have something to contribute to the group, try and get ahold of  one 
     of us on any IRG node and we'll see what you can do.

  5. Hackin' With Haywire
     The  word  Hacking I have heard a lot but I never did much  of  it  until
     recently, when Doctor Dissector put out NUAA105 (Doctor Dissector is  not 
     an  IRG member; he wrote and released NUAA).  Hackin' SprintNet  is  what 
     this  Hackin' with Haywire is about.  I will show you how to get  started 
     then leave you a list of NUAs that I know work, so here goes...
     
     1. First dial your local SprintNet
     2. Wait for connect
     3. Hit <CR> twice
     4. You will then get a @ sign, then type in one of the following NUAs
        you should get some kind of connect sign, then your ready to go...

By </\>asteland </\>arrior

Now that Haywire is done talking, I'll put in some more important stuff.  Each 
newsletter I will try to compile a list of as many hints to as many games as I 
can.   All  of  the following hints for Ultima VI were compiled  from  my  own 
experiences.  Since  a complete solution will take a while, I'll post  what  I 
have so far in the newsletters.  

The first, and most important news, is that there is at least one major bug in 
Origin's  software.  In order to obtain the 8th and final circle (level),  you 
need  to talk to the wisps, learn their secrets, and then talk to Xiao of  the 
Council  of  Wizards.  The problem is that Xiao doesn't always  recognize  the 
fact  that you have talked to the wisps.  I contacted Origin systems and  they 
are going to be releasing a patch for the program soon.

The  wisps  can be found in the forest at night. Take the  road  leading  west 
(left)  down  at the southern end of Britannia.  Stay on the road  and  you'll 
encounter probably two or three glowing balls of blue light.    The wisps will 
eventually  give  you a scroll for the eighth circle  spell  Armageddon  which 
destroys all life on this plane.  Since I can't find a use for this spell yet, 
it's  probably  not  a good idea to use just yet.  I'll  figure  it  out  soon 
though.

Xiao is over north of the Lycaeum at 1Nx69E.  The easiest way to reach her  is 
take  a boat directly across the sea and use the sextant to make sure  you  go 
far enough north.  She can teach you very powerful spells such as Telekinesis, 
X-ray, Wing Strike, and a lot of other stuff.  

The  most  important  spell  you'll  ever  learn  is  Ex  Por,  Unlock   Magic 
Doors/Chests.  It's a second circle spell and you can purchase it from Horance 
on an island just north of Skara Brae.  The coordinates are 15Sx23W.  Once you 
have  that  spell  you can get incredibly rich.  Another  important  piece  of 
information  is how to use spells.  Select [M]ove and then click  the  scroll, 
then click the magic book and it's in there... but be careful not to  overload 
a  spellbook,  I  figure 20 is about the maximum because  it  caused  me  some 
problems  like  not  being able to look back in the  book.   Blank  books  are 
available in Cove 2Nx30E, just take the eastern road, go through the Shrine of 
Compassion, and take the road leading out of the south-eastern end.  

Once you learn Ex Por go to the Justice building in Britannia and walk to  the 
northern  half where the mint is.  Go in and unlock the northwestern door  and 
the  three chests.  Get all the items from there.  Then you MUST cast Kal  Lor 
to  go back to the throne (don't worry the only way to loose experience is  to 
be  killed,  casting (help) only puts you back to Lord British).  If  you  are 
stealing  and don't cast (help) she won't give you gold.  Then return  to  the 
mint  and  ask her to trade and you'll get around 5000 crowns  total...   SAVE 
THIS MONEY FOR MAGIC!!! You NEED to save money for purchasing spells they  get 
expensive, same with reagents.  Look for the cheapest place for reagents, they 
go buy fast.

Another  very  powerful  sorcerer is Nicodemus.  His building  is  at  19Nx2E, 
southeast of Yew.  He sells Yew staves, which you can enchant with spells.  To 
enchant  a staff, learn the seventh circle spell Enchant (from here).  If  you 
are  not yet eight level but want to cast an 8th level spell, Enchant a  staff 
with the 8th circle spell and then arm yourself with the staff (like you would 
a  sword or shield) then [U]se it from there... Staffs are best when  you  are 
going  somewhere where you expect to use a lot of fireball spells,  you  first 
Enchant with about 20 spells (need to rest to get spell points back though  if 
you  are enchanting with a lot of spells) and then when you use the staff  you 
don't need reagents or magic points.

In  cove  there  is a very powerful 5th circle spell  called  Pickpocket.   It 
allows you to remove one item from whoever it is cast upon (just keep  casting 
to take more items).  Make sure you can carry it or the spell fails and  still 
takes  away reagents.  Merchants, in general, don't carry  anything.   Guards, 
however, are good for plate mail and some gold.  As soon as you can afford it, 
go south to Trinsic and buy magic armor for everyone in the party you will  be 
needing  it.  The exceptions to the merchants are the ship-wrights.   You  can 
pickpocket the deeds to ships and skiffs (very helpful).

Lord  British can't be killed, believe me I've tried.  But his rings are  good 
to Pickpocket, but remember rings and wands disappear after they've been  used 
a  while.   His amulet is magical, but doesn't do  anything  (called  customer 
support to make sure).  It's best to wear Spiked Collars which absorb 2 points 
of damage, but I can't remember which Armory you buy them at.  

The  Serpents Hold is at 75Sx35E on the southern side of an island.   You  can 
find  many valuable allies here like Seggallion who has 28 strength.  Talk  to 
the  armorer here about magic shields.  If you have a curved heater shield,  a 
lump of gold, and a gem, then he'll craft you a magic shield.  You can do this 
for every curved heater (snake) shield, gem, and lump of gold you have.

Iolo's place is at 17Nx14W.  Take the westward road from Britannia all the way 
up north until you find a road-sign saying Iolo's Hut.  And be sure to talk to 
Smith the Talking horse, he has a VERY helpful `clue' for you!

The Lycaeum is at 10Sx72E.  Get the half of the silver tablet... When you find 
the  other half, Mariah will decipher The Book Of Prophecies for  you.   There 
are  nine  pieces to the map leading to the other half.  I've found one  in  a 
shipwreck  down  by  Serpent's  Hold.  Also, The Orb  Of  The  Moons  is  very 
interesting.   Talk to Lord British about stone and then stand one  step  away 
from the snake on the rug in front of him and [U]se the Orb onto the snake.  A 
red moongate will appear.  I suspect is takes you to a different world,  since 
at first you appear outside the Shrine of Diligence.  But if you go  northwest 
around  the mountains you will find an entire land filled with gargoyles!   DO 
NOT  kill anyone.  For example Naxtilor is the Gargoyle King and if he's  dead 
the game will never be won.  Also don't talk to the lens maker since you can't 
understand any of them yet and the guy will die and you need his lenses later.

In  the  other  world at 42Sx25E you'll find the Tomb Of  Kings.   The  silver 
serpents are hard to kill but give 91 experience each.  You aren't supposed to 
know  this  yet, but the gargoyles milk their venom and drink it  just  before 
going  into  battle.  They fight "like the wind" but after a while  they  just 
drop  dead.   You can find a vial in Sutek's castle which I'll go  over  in  a 
second.  Also the electric field can be turned off by finding a switch in  one 
of the tombs. 

Those  of you who played Ultima V remember Lord Blackthorn's Castle,  west  of 
the  Isle of the Avatar.  The coordinates for the dock to his castle is  about 
75Sx60E,  maybe 75Sx65E I can't read my own notes.  Kill the  rabbits  quickly 
with a Flame Wind spell if you want, that's what I did... Or Wing Strike works 
good.   It  conjures  up a dragon that fly by and  attacks  each  opponent  in 
vision,  which  is  more than enough damage for rabbits.  Also  you  gain  the 
experience from the Wing Strike.

Go into his castle, and you will find a decorative sword on the wall..  Remove 
this  along with the holder, or just An Ylem to Vanish them.  Then look for  a 
secret  door  there  and walk though.  You can always  find  secret  doors  by 
looking  for a small pale imperfection on the wall.  To get past the  Ethereal 
Void, cast Telekinesis on the crank (spell learned from Xiao).  Before  coming 
to  the  castle it might be good to enchant your staff with  10  Remove  Field 
spells.   Whenever you see the swords, remove them and look for a door.   When 
you  get to the two signs each telling you where to go, go left.   Remove  the 
field and kill the monster.  Then search the eastern (right) wall and get  rid 
of  a  few of those fields and use the switches.  Some switches  go  different 
ways, you have to experiment.

Then  unlock  the two doors and search for secret doors on  the  north  walls.  
Make your way to the right and kill the Hydra.  In that room search the  north 
(remove  the swords) and south walls.  Go north and you can talk to Sutek  the 
Mad  Wizard.   I don't know what good he is yet so just keep  him  alive.   Go 
south through the secret door and down the stairs.  Keep searching and make  a 
map  to help you and you will eventually find the plans for a hot air  balloon 
(you need these plans).

Okay,  now the shrines.  First, get the rune and manta to the shrine and  then 
go  to  that shrine, kill the Gargoyles, and [U]se the rune with  the  mantra.  
Them  [M]ove  the stone off the altar.  If you take the stone you  can't  Gate 
Travel back there.  Then [T]alk to the altar and if you have enough experience 
you  are promoted a circle.  When you are moved up a circle you are  given  an 
attribute  raise.  Different shrines give different attribute raises.  I  went 
into  the game by bringing in an Ultima V character patched to  153  strength, 
intelligence,  and  dexterity.  Since 30 is the max it would  just  move  that 
attribute down to 30.  That sucks because strength is how much dammage a blunt 
weapon  does and how much you can carry, dexterity is how many moves  you  get 
and  how  good your aim is, and intelligence determines the  effects  of  your 
spells.

The  Rune of Honor is right in the middle of Trinsic (south of Britannia)  and 
the  mantra is Summ.  Oh yea if you go south out of Trinsic you will find  two 
buildings, one with a switch.  Use the switch and go back up to the armory and 
you can then get those weapons that were sealed off.  

The Rune of Valor can be found in a Tavern in Jhelom.  Look for the mouse hole 
in  the Tavern, and then Solo to Sherry and go in and get it.  The  mantra  of 
Valor is Ra.... The coordinates to Jholem are 16Sx19W or take a moongate  when 
the dominate moon phase is when the left half is white and the right is black.

The  Rune of Spirituality can be found in a house (chest) in Skara Brae,  just 
south  of where Horance lives.  The mantra of Spirituality is Om.  To  get  to 
this  shrine,  wait until the moon phase is black on the left,  white  on  the 
right (split in half) and go in.  Make sure you don't take the moonstone  from 
the shrine but just move it to the side or you won't ever go back!

The Rune of Compassion can be found in Britan.  Talk to Anya in the Blue  Boar 
tavern  and  ask about Rune.  Then go to the conservatory (just north  of  the 
oddity museum) and talk to the child Ariana about the rune.  Then stop talking 
and then resume talking and say you have permission.  Unfortunately the little 
bitch  said she gave it to me but she didn't and I don't know how to  get  it.  
It  may  be another one of those damn bugs and I'll let you know in  the  next 
newsletter when I find out.

The  Rune  of Justice is in Yew, in the Slaughtered Lamb Inn.  Just  move  the 
plant  to the side and there it is! The Mantra is Beh, that's all there is  to 
it.   You  are SUPPOSED to talk to Lenora and ask for permission  to  see  the 
thief, then go tell the jailkeeper you need to see him and you get the key.  I 
had  to lie to the thief to find the rune but you don't even need to  talk  to 
him.

That's  most  of what I have right now.  I'll be writing up some more  in  the 
next  newsletter,  and  when I finish a complete solution  I'll  release  that 
separately.   The  IRG-U6SS.ZIP  semi-solution is basically  a  collection  of 
information  to let you in on some secrets to the game (like the  books).   If 
you  have any questions or want more detail on something, you can reach me  at 
any IRG node.
