    International Rogues Guild and Shadow/Net Presents...            
    IRG Newsletter v5.01              Released: 1/31/91 
    Written by: Haywire               Edited by: Haywire
        
        Hola Folks,
                Hi everyone out there as you see I have changed the format a
little do to both The Spectral Demon and Control-S asking or telling me how to
change it.  Thanks for the ideas, anything to make IRG better.  As IRG gets
older I am stream lining it a little more each time.  Maybe one day it will be
perfect.

5.03 More About IRG
-------------------
        IRG is at last going.  Before I would of said it was still getting off
the ground, but now it is going good.  I get the newsletters off the ground
every two weeks or so and everything is fine.  I have changed a few things
around an one of the members The Spectral Demon has started his own group, so
go out and join either that or mine.  I find it hard that a person could run a
group and put all the could into another group so The Spectral Demon has left
IRG.  He will be writeing articals still though. 
        Ok now that thats all done with, heres the the current members and all
that stuff.

5.04 CyberPunk Follys
---------------------
        Here is one of those parts that I have decided to change.  People out
there need something more then just how to make bombs and that kinda shit.  I
will still be writing up things on Anarchy BUT I wish you guys would get that
kinda stuff in.  I will put everything submited to me in Letters From Prison.
I want responses to everything in the IRG Newsletters so if your pissed about
stuff I am saying then why don't you contact me upload a little file and more
then likely I will put it in the next newsletter.  So get everything that you
can in!
        Now for what I realy wanted to talk about, I will call it the State Of
The Union Address.  I have a few things to talk about, first the state of
hacking today, second the state of groups today, and last the state of new
hackers in our union.
        The State Of Hacking Today
                All I have to say is its a very poor state of things.  Hackers
are known how well they can hack systems that everyone and there brother can
hack.  People get in "wars" over how one person is a "hacker" and the other is
a "lamer".  What a joke, first the fucking wars are the funnesty things in the
world they call names at each other and then maybe virus there board.  Big
fucking deal.  Once maybe a few people will get together to drop by that
hackers house, well shit he happens to like 500 miles away in Kansas.  What are
ya suppost to do?  So you say ooh well guess that wars over.  Shit you people
are lamers, get a few of you friend "hackers" who live in Kansas to go over and
kick his butt, or don't even talk at all.
        Then theres that problem with who is a hacker and whose a lamer.  Well
sorry to tell you all but only about MAYBE 1% of you are hackers, and most of
them are the unknown users who hack not to gain status in the  computer world
but to get info on things there intested in.  You ask a hacker why he hacks
he'll say its fun, and I have to say that is pretty much bullshit.  Hackin' is
not that fun, the only thing fun about hacking is getting a rush when you find
something new, that NO ONE else has found, becuase then YOUR an elite K-rad
dude.  Or some crap like that.  The best thing to happen to the hacking world
right now would be for companies to start hiring mavrick hackers to get
information from other companies.  But that should not happen for a while.  I
know your probaby reading this right now going man, your a lamer Haywire, a
fuckin' LAMER!  Guess what I don't care what YOU think becuase I would believe
most people who are true hackers don't even read any groups newletters, so fuck
your a lamer too.
        In short the whole problem with hackers today is that they hack to find
fame not information.  The one only other problem are boards such as The
Reformer's board and Face To Face.  These kinda boards sell out all groups and
other poeple to the feds.  Those people who can't handle the presure of feds
running after there ass then they should get out of the computer world all
together.  NOT make a fed lover board.
        The State Of Groups Today
                Another problem are the groups, most groups are bullshit and
never do anything.  People want the fame of being a leader of a group so they
create some stupid group that does only one thing and that is nothing.  Of
course there is that problem with all those stuck up hackers who think there
god, shit I am sure you know a few.  Me, I can hack, not as well as I wish or
as most other people, but thats why I got this group together, it was to make a
place where people could teach other people to hack(like me).  It was also
hoping to bring more closness in the hacking comunity.  I started my board to
be a central information exchange center for IRG so that all those people who
want to learn or who can teach other people call up and do so.  The boards
working, of course never enough users but a bunchs of people are learning
new shit every day.  Now your thinkin' man this guy must have the total lamer
board, well shit sorry to say but its probably the best 619 board around for
hacking/phreaking info.  Thats all I gotta say on this, lets see whats next...
        The State Of New Hackers Today
                I went over this already alittle bit, but more or less people
need to learn and YOU self proclaimed hackers need to get your act together and
teach them.  The hackers are getting younger and with less of a life, that the
only problem with some of these new hackers.  All they do is sit infront of
there computers all day long, fuck get a life people.  Well thats all I gotta
say this time, next time more things that I have noticed over the last 2 weeks.


5.05 Letters From Prison
----------------------
        Well there is not much in here this issue, you people need to get some
stuff in!  Thanks to Kryptic Night for what he submitted.  Next time I have
been promised a bunch of articals, so be ready for alot of stuff next issue.


                                                        
5.06 Tymnet For The Novice
--------------------------
                  ___________________________         
                  \        Kryptic Night     \
                  /   of P4 and SMC presents /
                  \   Tymnet for the Novice  \
                  /__________________________/
                 Released under the IRG newsletter

 This file will try to teach the beginner of some basic facts
and methods for using Tymnet to it's fullest possible use.
This file will not be a comprehensive guid on (P)acket
(S)witching (N)etworks, or even on Tymnet itself. Rather it
is meant as a starting point for the beginning hacker.


I. Basic Packet Switching Networking

 Packet Switching Networks (PSN's) provide an efficient, and cheap, way
of data transmission. PSN's are made up of hundreds of interconnected
computers and gateways. When you transmit data over a PSN, it is bundled
into 128 characters blocks and sent through the network to it's destination
source. If the destination is outside of the originating network, it 
must go through a specific gateway. Gateways link up different networks, and
allow the user to contact virtually any network in the world. 
 To connect to a computer or service on a PSN you must use a (N)etwork
(U)ser (A)ddress. In laymans terms, a NUA is the equivilant of a phone 
number. If the computer you wish to connect to is outside of your 
originating network, you must use a (D)ata (N)etwork (I)dentifier (C)ode.
This 4 digit number tells the originating network which country and network
the NUA is located in. A NUA of 311040800110 could be divided up into 2
seperate pieces. The 3110 is the DNIC (Sprintnet) and the 40800110 is the
NUA. 

II. Tymnet

 Connecting to Tymnet is amazingly easy. First, of course, you will need
to find your local Tymnet indial. To do this, select one of the numbers
provided in Appendix (A). Call it any way you want to, code, direct, 
whatever. Make sure your term is put into (O)dd parity, (7) data bits, and
(1) stop bit, (O71). Once you connect to it you will receive a string of
characters, usually this is something like 'xxx>xx|x', and so on. At this 
point press the 'a' key. This will tell Tymnet that you have called it at
O71. This should drop you down into a 'please log in:' prompt. From their
type 'information'.  Information is Tymnet's user service system. From here 
you can find your local Tymnet indial, and many other pieces of 
information. At the menu you should be able to find which service you need. 
depending on your wants. 
 Once you have your local Tymnet indial, call it up as you did the last 
one and do the same thing as before until you get to the 'please log in:' 
prompt. This is where you will enter your (N)etwork (U)ser (I)dentification.
An NUI is the equivilant of a user name. Some NUI's are passworded but I've 
found that quite a few are not. Check Appendix (B) for a listing of a few
valid Tymnet NUI's that will connect to places as of 1/91.
 After you enter your valid NUI, and your password if needed, you will come
to a ; prompt. This is where you will enter your NUA. Check Appendix (C) 
for a listing of interesting NUA's. If at any time you wish to return to
the Tymnet login prompt, press Ctrl-Break and then return. This should take
you back to the login prompt from most systems.

 Well, that should get you started on your way to the use of Tymnet. If you

 If you wish to learn more about Packet Switching Networks, here is a list
of some excellant files that will help you learn more on them.

PSNINTRO        This file was written by Doctor Dissector of P/H/A,
                who is probably one of the more knowledgable persons
                on PSN's and networks in the world. This file will
                tell you about PSN's in general, and go into more depth
                on Sprintnet. Another program by Doctor Dissector in 
                relationship to PSN's is...
                NUAA - Network User Address Attacker, this is a Sprintnet
                       scanner, it's very easy to use, and is ripe with
                       options. The documents provided are also a great
                       source of information on Sprintnet

CIRCUIT         This is a confidential Tymnet Circuit Protocal manual
                that was captured by Bronstone and PhanthasMumble and 
                released under their group, PSC. This file is NOT for
                the beginner, as it is very technical. But if you can
                handle it, it is an excellant source of information
                on the inner workings of Tymnet.

TELENET         This file is a compilation of a Sprintnet indial list,
                an MTARG.DAT of over 200 Sprintnet numbers for use with
                Code Thief, and a short text file by Scooter. Although it's 
                not the best file in the world, it does list several 
                commands available to the Sprintnet user, and is good for 
                the beginner.
                
                
               
5.07 The Crack Down by The Spectral Demon
-----------------------------------------
                                                                    PSNfo
                                "The CrackDown"

        Recently (1-30-91) the 3 main NUi's that have gotten to
the more active H/P users have been shut down. Video, that which has
been around for a long time, pretty much everyone who is into tymnet has that
account (but most of the more knowledgeable H/P users have refrained from
doing so, because of its 'popularity'). In addition, T.LLOY01 and T.LLOY02 have
gone down as well.

        At the present time, one person alone hacking out 100+ NUi's, even
to find one password out of any would take a considerable amount of time.
However, with a larger group of people to aid in the hacking of these, the
amount of time would be decreased tremendously (depending on how big the
group of people is). So I have conjured up just such a group for this purpose,
since no one else has that I have been told of, and it needs to be done.
Network Hackers' Alliance (NHA).

        In IRG-03, I released to you 40+ NUIs, all virgin. Rather worthless,
to those who are unexperienced in the hacking field. On the other hand, they
can be a goldmine to those who know what they're doing.

        If you would like to join NHA and really want to help those of us who
will keep the H/P community's access to networks clear, please contact me
[The Spectral Demon], Haywire, or Skylar via internet address
IRG@PNET12.RFENGR.COM, or on the following boards:

                        Insanity Lane
                        (619) 591-4974
                        NUP: Last Try
                        SysOp: Haywire

                        The CorrupT SocieTy
                        (619) 630-8450
                        NUP: Defiance
                        SysOp: The Spectral Demon

        If you choose to join, we will provide for you a list of 100+
NUi's all begging to be hacked. You will either be assigned 1-5 NUi's
to hack, or you may choose your own (as long as they are not chosen
by another member). You must have a decent background in hacking,
and tymnet or other such network to be accepted.

        Remember, the list expands every day, and with each
NUi discovered the easier it is to hack 'em. For more information,
call the boards listed above.

        Thanks for listening, and we look forward to letters regarding
NHA or IRG, and I hope we have 'perked your interest' in this matter.
