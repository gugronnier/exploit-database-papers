Hi there,
Prime Anarchist here. Sorry this issue is late again. Well, you probably
don't care much as long as you get this every week or so, but I'm trying 
really hard to "constrain" myself to getting 11k out every Sunday nite. 
But last Sunday nite that JUST WASN'T GONNA HAPPEN.
   You've probably read about Earth First!'s occupation of Crandon WI's
proposed Exxon mine offices by now, and you've probably been given totally
false information. In an effort to NOT clear any of that up (not worth
anyone's time trying), but to add my own distorted perception, I'm just 
going to add two very important facts that never made any media. 
1) in the chaos of 29 (30 if you count the one unthwarted getaway) arrests
one Earth First!er got away with a new pair of handcuffs. That's right, the
arresting office was so hot for more arrests he abandoned his first arrest.
He or she (the EF!er) walked off calmly and then found someone to help him
or her open the cuffs. 
2) short of the arrests themselves, the entire action was peaceful. 
   You'll notice that no media reports give any evidence that the thing was
violent in any way shape or form, but they sure don't go out of their way to
say it was peaceful either.
   Yeah, the media suxx. But Exxon suxx worse, so you work with what you 
got and the warrior fights nonviolently like Ghandi with attitude watching
the rest of the world crumble around him or her. I was quite pleased to 
notice Monday nite while helping Earth First with their jail support that
ABC and NBC allowed the words "EXXON Valdez oil spill" through 3 different
times during their 6pm newscasts. Afterall, they're owned by Westinghaus
and General Dyslectric. So I guess all attempts at guerrilla theatre were
right on.
   Ask me about the Wisconsin Forest Hodag someday.

** Ground Zero's Random Notes **

Pollution Control or People Control?  

On June 25, US President Clinton announced tougher new 
pollution control standards from the EPA, supposedly
created in the name of "improving public health" and
"protecting the children."  But this action brings more
questions than answers.  

Does this new pollution control really have anything
to do with public health, or is it just another tool for
government control, social engineering, and private property
confiscation?  

Check out California's pollution control plan:  

" Many older cars are expected to fail the Dynamometer
(SMOG II) Test, perhaps 60% according to the EPA... What's
happening... is frightening and ominous. It's about
getting folks out of their cars, by force of fraud......." 
 -- Eric Peters, The Wall Street Journal, May 9,1996  

"Gross Polluter' means a vehicle with excess....emissions as
established by the Department......"  --  California Health
 and Safety Code, Section 39032.5
 

"'Gross Polluter'....30 days to pass the Smog test... if you
can't afford repairs (no ceiling on cost),.....Your car can
be taken by government and crushed."  --  Jim Anderson, President,
Automotive Technician's Association, March 19,1996  

"Businesses surpassing emission standards will be forced to buy
'Pollution Credits' from the state government to continue 
operating.... The state gets 'pollution credits' to sell by 
rushing cars....selling 'pollution credits' is not cleaning up
the air...."   -- Jim Anderson, President, Automotive
Technician's Association, March 19,1996  

Taken and crushed??  Remember that little clause in the
Constitution about how private property shall not be taken for
public use without just compensation (want to place any bets on
 whether the State will buy you a new car before
it crushes your old one?).  

Think this can't happen here?  Or that it can't happen in
your state?  These new federal mandates are a step in that
direction.   Perhaps the most important question raised is this:
how can the EPA dictate law to the American people?  How can
the President dictate law?  Isn't that the job of  Congress?
Did you know the President can make law at his discretion?  He
simply issues an "Executive Order", and if left unchallenged, it
becomes law just as if Congress had passed it.  It is even possible
to make laws that go against the will of Congress (remember the
 Peso bailout? Congress said "no", but the President
did it anyway). 


--> No Escape?

The REAL reason for these new standards may be to force
Americans to phaze out old cars and phaze in new cars that can
be (or already are) equipped with a "kill switch" in which law
enforcement officials (or New World Order stormtroopers) 
can shut off the ignition of cars they are pursuing.  
I don't know about you, but I don't want anyone but me being in
control of my car.

Hi,
You reached Lenox MA.  (Western -- near NY state)
I'm a bit confused though -- do I know you?  Are we on a list together?
And what exactly is this 'zine?
I go to school at Stanford, Palo Alto CA, so I guess you reached there,
too.


Prime,
My sister <jafuller@bics.bwh.harvard.edu> or 
<104255.2704%compuserve.com@hin.sld.cu> is coming down this summer.
If you could call a progressive newspaper and find someone interested 
in making a donation to Prensa Latina Publications in Havana, we need 
desperately:

JOURNAL POEM 14 BY MARCO

Coffee buzz at Denny's 4AM.

How do you outrun a storm on a 10speed?
Ride really hard Buck, and don't look back.
Ask a local ahead of time, when is
Thunder's first most likely crack.

Mexicali tofu and a hot potato salad.
New England chowder and a quesedilla.
Salad, soup & sandwich bar sumptous.
Home of the perfect hummus.
What's in a guacamole salad?
Can I get my espresso in a to-go cup?

A sagebrush tumbleweed 
Squeezes out under a Ford Falcon;
Bounces up toward my face
Then around over my head.

Cripple Creek or Bust.

If you don't want a watch tan:
Then don't wear a watch.
