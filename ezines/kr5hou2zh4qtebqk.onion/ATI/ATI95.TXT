  / ATI -- YOUR HACKER-ZINE  OF HOPE \

 \------------------------------------/

Hello there, and welcome to ATI 95. It's Sunday, 7:30 EST. (ed note: 
correction. It's Tuesday 830am. Same Timezone. This has been a labor of love.
<frustrated grin> S'what I get for even mentioning issue 9. 
Karma there. OK...) I was GOING TO Compose this on a MacSE I'm babysitting, 
but I'm still a little spooked  about trying that on anything 
Apple/Commodore/Atari since way back in the days of issue 9. 
If you  do a hotbot or yahoo search for ATI issue 9 you'll see what I mean. 
   Anyhow I'm Prime Anarchist and I'll be your guide through this wacky 
edition of Activist TimeSignatures Ingratiated. As you probably know by now,
ATI 94 had really wide recirculation and AWESOME response. In fact, many
people around the world took its parody of S.P.A.M. (which stands for
Some People Act Mellow) quite seriously. I guess I should've added my 
-    -      -   -       
Post Office Box afterall. My friend Jeff said I'm the next Castro, whatever
THAT means. Anyhow, we got lots of good stuff in store for you. We'll start
with Ground Zero's column and then on to some numbers running and calendars.
If you want back issues, t-shirts, hats, cap 'n crunch whistles (only 11 
left) go to:

------------> Random Notes from Ground Zero
                 gr0und0@iirg.org <- NOTE NEW ADDRESS!
 

Greetings, folks.  This time I'll say a few words about Beyond Hope, the 
hacker conference hosted by 2600 Magazine in New York last month.  

The general area of the conference was interesting in itself.  The lobby
was filled with tables of people selling back issues of 2600 Magazine,
posters, T-shirts, and more.  One table was manned by people from a New 
York pirate radio station called "Steal This Radio."  Another table
manned by a very interesting fellow known as "Conspiracy Bob"
offered information on New World Order conspiracies. 

Another room provided terminals for people to log onto systems, an area
for people to plug in their laptops, and a huge sound system blasting 
nerve-frazzling techno music.  I considered logging into my ISP to
check my email, but decided against it.  My suspicions were confirmed
when, during the "Information for the Masses" panel, the speaker Steven 
Rambam advised a "roberto @ NEU" and anyone else using the terminals
to log into remote systems to change their passwords.

I won't go into much detail about the panels, as you can read about them
in detail on Beyond Hope's website, http://www.hope.net , or Chesire
Catalyst's web site, http://digital.net/~cheshire/ .
You can also listen to some of the panels recorded in Real Audio format
at http://www.hope.net . Briefly, here are some highlights of the
conference:

The Information for the Masses panel described the nature and scope of
of information that businesses, governments and other organizations 
compile on individuals.  Rambam, a private investigator, stated that
private investigators and hackers share a common goal: the 
democratization of information.  However, the amount of information 
available on individuals is astonishing: one's income, political and
religious affiliations, spending habits, sexual orientation and more can 
be readily obtained using numerous sources described in the panel.

The L0pht panel is worth mentioning, although I will let them speak 
for themselves at http://www.l0pht.com .  All I can say about them here
is that people such as those of the L0pht are the future of computing.

An annoying panel member was Ira Winkler, part of the "Tiger 
Teaming" panel about people who are paid by corporations to
hack into their systems and report security holes.  Winkler stated that
most hackers are "losers" who hack into systems to brag about their
exploits on BBS systems, and such people are an impedence to Winkler.
Winkler also hosted another panel by himself, "Where Hackers and
Criminals Collide," where he administered his "Are You Clueless?" 
test to the audience.  The test allowed points for dubious hacking
skills, such as being able to have two or more platforms share the
same printer, and deducted points for possessing a lineman handset.
It appears that Winkler is the clueless one.

An optional event of Beyond Hope was the TAP reunion, which I
attended.  Chesire Catalyst, some old TAP regulars, and a mix of
other Beyond Hope attendees descended upon Eddie's Restaurant in
New York.  Chesire was a very interesting and personable gentleman,
and welcomed me and the group of friends I arrived with.  

Another unofficial event of the weekend was my visit to a local
bar called Milano's on Houston St.  Entering the bar was like
stepping back into history.  The bar was established in the 1880s,
and displayed its original tax stamp, along with countless 
photographs, newspaper clippings and other memorablia.  

I learned about the overly zealous punishment given to some members
of the hacker community such as Kevin Mitinick and  Bernie S.
Any prosecution or imprisonment by the government is done in the
name of its citizens.  Those who agree with the government's excessive 
treatment of the above affirm the state's right to commit the same
excesses on any other member of society, for any reason, at any time.

I met some old friends, such as my friends at IIRG: Thomas Icom,
Black_Ic, Mercenary, and others.  I made some new friends, and met
a lot of interesting people.

In the aftermath of Beyond Hope, there are reports that are
troubling.  There are unconfirmed allegations that I won't repeat
here until some corroborating information is received, and other 
post-conference issues, such as 2600 Magazine staff posting on the 
internet what is claimed to be White House Communication Agency
pager transcripts.  But despite all that, I must say that I 
gained new insights, some new ideas, and learned a lot.  Events
such as Beyond Hope are worthwhile, as they help define a sense
of community and reinforce the positive aspects of hacking: the 
creativity, the energy, the desire to discover, learn, grow and
challenge.  And that always has been, and always will be
required of civilization.

Hi Marco,
My name is Nate and I am a student at Fairhaven College in Bellingham, WA.
I am working with a group of students on a school publication. Our editor,
Samantha, is on the can-aj list and forwarded your post to me.
  We are interested in learning more about how to use the internet as a
means of publication.
  Could you please forward me a recent edition of ATI?
  Thanks in advance!

Dear Friend:
Thank you for writing to Vice President Gore via electronic 
mail.  Since coming on-line, vice.president@whitehouse.gov has 
received thousands of messages from people all over the world.
Although the volume of mail prevents the Vice President from 
personally reviewing each message, be assured that your concerns, 
ideas, and suggestions have been read carefully, and a detailed 
report of the mail is provided to the Vice President on a regular 
basis.  Your message will be brought to his attention as part of 
that report.  We currently are working toward a system that will 
allow us to respond more specifically to your messages.
In order to do so, your help will be needed to ensure that 
we can read and record your message clearly.  Please try to write 
short and concise messages, address only one issue per message, 
and send only one copy of your message.  You will receive one 
automated response per day.
On October 20, 1994, President Clinton and Vice President 
Gore acted to improve the accessibility of government information 
by opening a service called "Welcome to the White House: An 
Interactive Citizens' Handbook" on the Internet.  This new World 
Wide Web service provides a single point of access to all 
electronic government information on the Internet.  By using a 
free Web-browsing software program such as Mosaic or Cello, the 
user can access a multimedia interface to information from the 
White House and the Executive Branch of government, including 
White House documents, a virtual tour of the White House, and 
detailed information about Cabinet-level and independent 
agencies.  This interface includes photographs, audio, and 
"hotlinks" to other government Web sites and services.  You 
should check with your service provider for instructions on how 
to browse the Web.  "Welcome to the White House" can be accessed 
at:
http://www.whitehouse.gov
publications@whitehouse.gov

     In the body of your message, type "Send Info" (without 
quotes); no other text should be included, specifically message 
headers or signature lines (.sig files).  The instructions will 
be sent to you automatically.
faq@whitehouse.gov
All of us at the White House are excited about the progress 
that has been made with this historic project, and we look 
forward to future developments.  Your continued interest and 
participation are very important to us.

Sincerely,
Bill Mason  (202)

PAWN WORLD NEWS TONITE -- WASHINGTON, District of Columbus. 
   IRS AGENTS, HIDING FACES ALLEGE ABUSE OF SHEEP. Janet Reno Blames Syphilis
On Taxes. Sheep Are Often Abused, Senators Told.
   "Sometimes we would tie their legs," said a faceless IRS agent. 
"Sometimes we even manipulate their you-know-whats," outbursted one without
a spine. The taxman further expounded that unfair cash collecting or
bribery, as they say in other countries has been practiced by representatives
of the US Government in both the census bureau AND the IRS.
   "Sometimes you count their children and their livestock," said a high
level official who asked to remain spineless, "and sometimes we screw them.
It's like 'poetry-in-taxation,'" he said.
   He went on to share that it shouldn't surprise OR bother anyone. In fact,
any families willing to pay their taxes early enough to not need such abuse
will be given two US made Claymore anti-personell mines. They're new and
improved -- now with even more C5 and less rocksalt and steel shavings.

ENGLAND AND WASHINGTON -- US DEPARTMENT SPOKESWOMAN MARGARET THATCHER
ANNOUNCES DEFCON 3.5 DUE TO RECENT DEATHS OF PRINCESS DIANA AND MOTHER
THERESA.
   "People are going to take sides," Said Maggie "Juevos-the-size-of-
church-bells" Thatcher in a press conference at the FTC building.
   "They're drawing straws already."
   Irish Catholics are expected to believe Mother is most important, while 
Protestants are expected to take the Queen's daughter's side.
Pope John Paul the 13th has announced an official British World-Soccer-
Grudge-Match to be held this Saturday in an effort that people would do in
sports what they should NOT do in civil unrest. The state department is
downright mortified over this. All military personell the world over are 
on hyper-alert. It could go to DEFCON 3.6 any moment, according to Thatcher,
"Or, Queen forbid, DEFCON 95, 97 or 98 or DEFCON NT."
   "They should do football, oh that Papal grandson pisses me off. All we'd
fear there is broken necks. People get KILLED in those English soccer
stadiums. Everyone from the fullback to the hot-dog vendors. Thatcher should
know, she's related to everyone in rows 3, 5, 7, 9 and 11 all the way 
around.
   The state department is worried that should a ground war begin before a
proper airstrike could be implemented, 15,000 relatives of George Bush
could be lost and it might take the Republican Guard 6 months to die off.
   "That's OK though," Maggie was over-heard via telephone with former 
president Ronald Regan (sic), "We could always WIN-NUKE them with a PenPal
greeting or a Goodtimes virus."

JOURNAL POEM 23 by Marco Capelli
 
        Pomegranite.

Does anger have taste?
Car's down 'til roads clear.
December the freezin' season.
2-8 a.m. only good times to drive;
Least bit of thaw slides you 
        Off-road.
Big Mountain, thrown off a horse;
Hauling water & hay for the elders.
Fixing hay shack, chopping wood.
VW microbus' 1st gear freezes stuck.
'Til 10am or so. (so cold & dry.)
Jan. 7, 1992. 9am. Lamb born to
The sheep who looks like Don King.
Denny makes coffee for wider eyes;
And 85th monkey follows the wind
Pondering the 4 directions. Red, 
White, yellow and black; Nevada,
Mexico City, Washington, or Spain.
James buys Edensoy in Winslow's 
Art Colony Fish Hatchery Homeless
Veterans Shelter. Vanilla's good;
Original's not. Run cooperatively
Sells bikes and skateboards too.
Customary cleaning woodstove each
Sunrise. Ash is for the outhouses
Always keep hot water on in case
Company comes. And the door key 
Hangs from lower branch of a tree. 
What's yellow, black and white?
        Uranium.
Headache and much noise. "Don't herd
The sheep near the uranium wash," 
Auntie says, "makes them act wild."
Well, you would too if you had those
        Headaches.
Told my guardian angels are spiders,
Whales, porcupines, buffalo, crows,
Badgers, turtles, bats & dolphins.
Roasted pinons; like chestnuts the
Size of roasted coffee beans.
"Nova" means food in Hopi.
"O" is yes in Navajo. "Ba" is bread.
        Go figure.
So what's red, white, yellow and black?
        Pomegranite in a wash full of
Uranium.
