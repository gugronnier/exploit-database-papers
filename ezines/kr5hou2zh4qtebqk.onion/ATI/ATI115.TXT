Dear Prime,
I didn't change a thing. Look at this paragraph from AP!

Israel has asked to buy millions of doses of antidote to the
weapons from the United States, according to an Israeli
government official who spoke on condition of anonymity.

Little Pete, Earl of Sand.
Pux, Penn.



Why would ATI ever be upset that Paul Harvey was hawking Walmart.  That
dyed in the wool conservative has been fooling the american public for
years with his down home folksy crap.  We all think he's telling nice
stories of americana when the reality is that he's one step away from Rush
Limbaugh.

Trust me.  Go get a history of Paul Harvey's broadcasts and listen to them
for a week. By the end if you're not puking your guts out then you are a
card carrying member of the Christian Coalition for the rights of unborn
white republicans.

So wake up ATI!!!  That's not your fathers Pontiac you're getting screwed in.

-DP-
Boston, Mass.

If you are offended easily, go away now. If you are
super religious and take things way too seriously concerning 
your religion, go away as well. 
The same goes for those with no sense of humor. 
If you decide to stay, and something does offend you, you are 
free to write me and whine about it, but chances 
are unless you have a legitamate complaint I'm just going to 
laugh at your letter, and put up on my page if it's stupid enough. 
But anyhow, this is what I'm going to do. If you see something on 
this page that you think you have seen before or created
yourself, then you know where the credit is due. 
Otherwise I take all credit for everything else, 
unless you yourself want to take credit for something, which you are
certainly free to do so. I'm not going to know probably, 
and even if I did i dont really care. 
If you want to put something written from my page on yours, by all 
means go ahead. I'd appreciate a link back here or a 
little mention of my name, but if not, oh well. I don't really care. 
a goodly portion of the stuff on this page, including this 
disclaimer, is stolen anyway. Thank you, drive thru.

USP LEAVENWORTH Text and Graphics by Lori Kettner & Maureen Flynn-Hart,
        L A W R E N C E , K S  -  On May 20, Walk Across 
America For Mother Earth marched into a flurry of events designed 
to honor indigenous people. 
        You can believe in Creator in any way you choose in the US, but
ultimately you have to respect the Earth. Ultimately you have to live
a life where the Earth replenishes itself each spring. It is THE way
of life.

        "This country is following a drug-mentality - it's a 
        mentality that will do anything for a quick fix," said
        David Hill in front of Leonard Peltier's Leavenworth
        jail cell. "They are out there teaching you that you
        are one purchase away from happiness. We want you to
        know that is a lie. You have to find happiness today.
        You have to find freedom today. Don't let them convince
        you that you have to wait until you're 65 and you have
        to have a Winnebago before you can find freedom."

We now return you to the reprint of the interview Prime Anarchist gave
in 1992 to Infinite Onion magazine about his walk across the country.
David Fischer - Is there a connection to Big Mountain? If so what?
Prime Anarchist - Oh yeah. A big one. The people down at Big Mountain
                  are living proof that the Genocide of the last 
                  500 years is still going on. In fact after people
                  up in Pine Ridge, and the people over at the 
                 Nevada Test Site trying to live through all the
                bombing on their ancestors' lands, Big Mountain is
               one of the biggest travesties of justice and simply
              the worst insult to humanity there is.
Fischer - You want to say more, I can tell...
Anarchist - Get those vapor locking Navy A-6 fighters and polluting
           Air Force B-2's away from the Four Corners area! You're
          ruining the juniper and sage and you're scaring the hell
         out of the sheep. Do you know how hard it is to lead 6 goats
        and forty sheep after a fighter pilot screams up a ravine 
       you're in... 9 feet over your head??? One time I found a sheep
      shaking behind a rock as if she knew it was the end of the 
     world. If you keep doing this... maybe this WILL be the end.
D.F. - Craziest story?
P.A. - Craziest, hmmm. Well, in Amarillo there's ten pink Cadillacs 
      with their noses buried in an old corn field. It's called the
     Cadillac Ranch Museum and some oil baron guy bought ten brand
    new cadillacs to do this, I swear. They look like they fell out
   of the sky.
      "Looks crazy," said one of the other walkers.
      "Looks pretty fucking stupid," I said. My journal entry that day
  just says: "only in Amerikkka."
 Keep in mind this is Texas where you can get a free 72 ounce steak if
you can eat all of it in half an hour without dropping dead from
cholesterol shock, angina, or a full blown heart attack.
D.F. - What convinced you to join the army??? And what convinced you
       to get out?
P.A. - Good question. I joined in '88 for the peacetime GI Bill to go 
       to college. During basic training a Navy A-6 blew 2 Libyan
       MIG's out of the water and when we found out everyone cheered
       except me. It suddenly dawned on me. There's two pilots I've
       never met and will never know if I liked them or hated them.
       I'll never know. They're dead. And we're fucking cheering.
      Then a year later we invaded Panama to regain control of the 
     Canal and to shut Noriega up about Bush's hand in Iran Contra.
    Then exactly a year later we're kicking it into high gear -- 
   Showing George is no whimp, he goes after Saddam Hussein
  "the next hitler," he tells us. Yeah, the same guy Bush helped stuff
 ballot boxes for in 1980 in his "election" against a man named Bakr
who wasn't as "moderate" and as "secular" as Hussein. Back then, Bush
called him Mr. Hussein. Now it's Sodom??? Gamorrah Bush is slimier than
a one-eyed sapsucker on a honeycovered x-rated waterslide at Disney.
But I digress. Right after the Persian Gulf war I got a medical
discharge which I was supposed to get 8 months prior. Did you know we
were about 20 bodies away from a draft during Operation Desert Swarm?
Yes. And I made one of them!!! They kept me listed as a full fledged
"active duty" even though my paperwork had to say "physically unfit
for duty." The scoop is -- if I left without a soldier coming in from
basic to replace me, we were a social security number away from 
not effectively defending the continental US during our gallavants
overseas. And that would have looked bad to congress. And God forbid 
to the American people. So they released me after "mop-up." If I didn't
have a medical discharge coming for my knee injury, I would've hunger
struck. There are about 700 soldiers still in stockades over in Saudi
and God knows how many everywhere else. And all they did was say,
"count me out." Oh well, that just gave me eight more months to decide
how much I hate Bush's administration, and any pseudo democratic
alternatives, and this whole fascist government. Do you know where 
Hussein got his signal corps training when he was a young officer?
FORT GORDON, GA!!! I SAT IN HIS OLD CHAIR DURING MINE!!! That was 
back when we didn't like Iran I guess. And Russia didn't like Iraq.
    (This interview continues next week in issue 116)

Yeah, yeah,
God works hard.
And yea, yeah,
Punch the time card.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yea yeah.

What if God made minimum
Just a job at minimum
Would he work for minimum
Or be a jerk for minimum.

If God was employed; what would he do
And would he come in at nine
Or maybe two
And would he ask union scale
And save for an IRA
Take straight pay
Or share all the profits (prophets?)

And yeah, yeah.
God kinda slacks
yeah yeah, he's always eating snacks.
And yeah, yeah, yeah, yea yeah...

What if God made minimum
Just a job at minimum
Would you downsize God for minimum.
Or be a jerk for minimum.
