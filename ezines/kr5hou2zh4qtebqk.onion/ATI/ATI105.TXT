----->   Random Notes from Ground Zero
		   By Ground Zero     

Hey folks! I'm putting up my very own web site soon! Watch for it!
And now..

	  A Chat with the Phone Man (A work of fiction)
	
	
	As I sat at the bar, the blue baseball cap sported by one of 
my neighbors' caught my eye.  It sported the new Bell Atlantic logo.  
	I couldn't resist.
	"Hey, do you work for the phone company?" I asked.
	"Yeah," he answered.  "This is the brand-new baseball cap they have.
I'm one of the very first to get it."
	"So what do you do for them?  Repairs, installations?"
	"Yeah, both," he replied.  "Been there for a few years."
	"Interesting.  I always wanted to work for the phone company.  
Do you like it?"  I asked.
	"Yeah, it's fun," he replied, sipping his beer. 
	I gulped down the rest of my beer and ordered another one.  
	"What's your name?"
	"Keith."
	"Hmm, sounds like fun.  I'd love to see what one of those central 
offices looks like from the inside," I mused.
	"Well the public isn't allowed in the central offices."
	"I'm more than just the public," I said, smiling.  Keith looked 
at me strangely, trying to discern the significance of my remark.  
	"How is it that you're allowed in the central office when your 
job is repairs and installations? You don't need to go to the 
central office to do those things."
	"Because *I* work for the phone company," he replied, grinning.
	"But don't the people at the central office know you don't 
really belong there?
	"Do you have to show them ID?"
	"No, we just walk in."
	"So theoretically I could just walk in one of these central 
offices myself if that's true," I reasoned.
	"What if they ask you who you are and where you work?  What would 
you do?"
	"Start running, I guess," I said, laughing.       
	"No wait, I got it! I'll just tell them I work with you!  
So what do you do in one of those central offices when you visit one?"
	Keith considered me for a moment.  "We just hang out."
	"Really?  What do you do then, listen to people's conversations?"
	"Not really."
	"Yeah, I'll bet!  I know what you do in there!" I said, teasing him.
"So Keith, what do you think of hackers?" I asked.
	"Who?"
	"Hackers.  You know, people who can get into other people's 
computer systems, including those belonging to the phone company."
	"I never really thought about it.  Why?"
	"You should learn about these things if you want to get ahead! 
Don't you want to advance in the company?"
	"Yeah, I'd love to have one of those corner offices," Keith answered.
	"Well, think big!  Learn all you can!"  The beers were starting 
to kick in.  I decided to test Keith's knowlegde.  "So do you guys still 
use COSMOS?"
	"No, that hasn't been used in a long time. That's way old.  How do
you know about that?  Are you one of them?"
	"One of who?"
	"Hackers."
	"I could be," I said tenatively.  "How about LMOS?  Do you use that
or is that outdated by now?"
	"Yeah, we use that."
	"What about REMOBS?"
	"REMOBS?"
	"Never mind," I said, laughing.  "You know we know how to
use loops."
	"Loops?  Hey wait a minute.  You said 'we''.  Who are 'we'?"
	"Fruit Loops," I said, laughing.
	"Yeah, you're a fruit loop all right.  But you *looked* like such a 
nice girl!"
	"Appearances can be deceiving, you know.  Hey I know what the
ANAC is.  How do you like that?"
	"ANAC, huh.  I'm not even going to touch that one!"
	"Yeah, you know, dial 958 and it reads back the number you're
calling from.  The public isn't supposed to know about that!  So can you
get me a test set?"
	"No," Keith said, laughing.
	"How about one of those cool terminals you use?"
	"No, not unless I want to keep my job."
	"You know I'm only kidding, right?  How about one of those new
Bell Atlantic baseball caps?  I wouldn't want it for free, I'll give you
the money if you can buy one for me."
	"No, I had a hell of a time getting one for someone who worked
for the phone company for over 35 years and is retired now.  They're
that hard to get," Keith replied.
	"Well, that makes me want one all the more!"  I ordered another
beer for myself and one for Keith.  I put my arm around him.
	"Keith, stick with me. You'll go straight to the top!"


.....................

In an unrelated story, Bell Atlantic just announced the cost of a payfone
call is rising in NJ to 35 cents.  What a rip! 

The new issue of Cybertek has an interesting article on payfones and why
the red box is going to be obsolete.  For more info, see:

See you next time.  And remember, Be Creative!

Thanks Ground Zero. It's always nice to hear from Joiz-ee.
OK, this is the special giving-of-thanks issue of ATI, Active 
Thanksgivings Indicated.
We give thanks to GZ, and Fah-Q; thanks to the world wide web,
Angelfire, Geocities, Etext.org, oh, let's not forget suck.com.
Thanks, people. And an especially big indication of thanks to 
all my readers "all-over-the-haus," and I mean that from the 
bottom of my art. All of you. Portugal especialmente, hola:
que tal la familia??? Gracias, gracias al todo.

s prime.

OK, we move right over to PRIME ANARCHIST WORLD NEWS and then a
special guest star input from mr. nopie himself. Then not much
else, I'll end with a poem of mine perhaps, or maybe steal one.
Hey, cheer up, this only happens once a year. I mean 2 issues in
one week only happens once. Not Thanksgiving. Thanksgiving happens
every day. Every meal if you do it right. =) Yack!!! I sound like
an earth day fanatic or something. <flashing two peace/victory signs>
"turkeyday is every day, d00dz; hang eight." (Oh I forgot, I 
H A V E     all 10. (good luck following that one: excessive brain
dump de-activated))


(WallyHood - CALIF.) -PAWN.   NEWTON SAYS HE LOST HIS PAINTINGS
WHILE ZONKED OUT ON IBOGAINE.
	"I want my art back," said the famous opera diva, Huey
P.F. Newton, of the paintings now held in escrow by a joint 
branch of the IRS and the Federal Marshalls.
	He claims the Dalai Lama, John F. Kennedy Jr., Robert
Ulrich, Jimmy Carter and German rap trio Tic Tac Toe all saw IRS
agents and US Marshalls sting him and then take his paintings away.
He's demanding their return and 25 million dollars given him for
all his troubles.
	"First they threw hot bubbling acid at my face," said 
Newton, which must hurt when you've already got white ibogaine
powder up your nose and under your eyelids, "then they took my
Pablo Picassos and Rembrandts. Ooh, they pissed me off."

I guess I have to reply to that one heheheh.

As you have guessed this is Fah-q The Irish Roads Warrior! I guess 
since you have reprinted a cygnus blurb I have to come up with something 
new.

Here I am in the heartland of central Illinois and I love it here. 
Most of the people in these old towns still think it is the 50's 
and some think that that is too new fangled for them. The kids 
get together and hang out on the railroad crossing and just drink " to 
use a word that they use here " "POP" you couldn't find a beer in this 
town if you had a million dollars and you best well go to some church 
on sunday morning....afternoon......evening......night or they will 
look at you like you are some kind of freak. I have hung a picture of 
jesus in my window ( jesus?.... or is that jeff...?) and when they come 
over and ask me to go to church with them I ask if they would accept 
the mormon missionaries some thursday evening for a visit. I drive too 
fast for the cop? ( he doesn't have a gun and his name is andy no 
kidding) and he says that I have to stop bothering the librarian to 
get Steal This Urine Test. The library is owned by the Piat County book 
worm society. They have some good books 
here in the stacks but since there is no T.V here to speak of I read most 
of the old books in the place and wanted some new ones. I tried to give 
them some that i had but they got turned down as too controversial ( tom 
clancy , alan ginsberg complete poems and white shroud ) nope noway.
 I am thinking of getting another chevette and a pen......

well i have to get going so i can make it to lake decatur and listen to 
the art bell show on wsoy....

Two Line Poem 
	-by Harry Ehren.

There I sat in Elija's Diner
    -for 25 hours:
He never came.



JOURNAL POEM 32
       by Prime Anarchist.
Harmonarchy, a house hoping 
For harmonious anarchy.
Got a Christ room and everything.
Waking up I ask my wife wonderfully,
Is margarine magnetic?
If you're quiet, you can hear
The owls go to sleep.
Just a random thought
Happily hazarded.

So there we were thinking "here we
Are slapdash in an unplanned spot."
Gentrification -- a $10 word. If you
Can't afford it -- means racism.

Will the Yucatan pope show up at the
Vatican peninsula? Expecting him
Is like Pope on a hope.
2 Heyoka moons each month. Sometimes 3.
If you own a dish you might see 
Him applying his clown white,
Or noxeeming it off. Dare I call it
Papal soap? Hope not -- nope.
Diet pancakes in New Rochelle reduces
Stresses from NYC driving.
Half moon, heyoka -- a spiritual slap
In the face. More fun than anything
Pious, pompous, or pathetically
Prudish any day.
Fact, a clown each day makes
For a nice clean smile.
Even better than soap.
