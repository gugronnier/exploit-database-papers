HONG KONG- Wang Dan has agreed to leave the China in exchange for his release
from prison. 27 year old Wang served 3 1/2 years for his involvement in
the Tianamen Square demonstrations (that China still insists never happened)
((imaginese: "you can leave now. You've served all your time as punishment
for all that stuff you didn't do. Thank you for not protesting all the
terribly heinous things that we don't ever do."))
        Last October, he was sentenced to another 11 years in prison for 
publishing essays critical of the Communist party and meeting with other
dissidents. The government accused him of plotting subversion, and found
him guilty after a four-hour trial.

Thanks Marco... I wasn't sure what this "newsletter" was all about,
Hey!
I don't know who you are, but anyone who prints the Unabomber Manifesto
can't be all bad. I've got 2 copies of it (and underlined) it
several times. Plus I'd like to put parts of it in poetry and illustrate
them. Plus, I have a web page with a bunch of fiction stories I wrote about
the Unabomber.
http://www.geocities.com/SoHo/Lofts/2532
So you know I'm quite fascinated with this character!
Thanks!

          . . - . - . - . . . - . . - . . . - . . - . . - .
67...our lives depend on decisions made by other people; we have no control
over these decisions and usually we do not even know the people who make
them. "(We live in a world in which relatively few people- maybe 500 or 1000
make the important decisions"--
Phillip B. Heyman of Harvard Law school, quoted by Anthony Lewis, New York
Times, April 21, 1995.) Our lives depend on whether safety standards at a
nuclear power plant are properly maintained; on how much pesticide is allowed
to get into our food or how much pollution into our air; on how skillful (or
incompetent) our doctor is; whether we lose or get a job may depend on
decisions made by government economists or corporation execs and so forth.
Most individuals are not in a position to secure themselves against these
threats to more (than) a very limited extent. The indicidual's search for
security is therefore frustrated, which leads to a sense of powerlessness.
NOTE 11. ..we can't claim that today's acquisition-oriented culture is 
exclusively a creation of advertising and marketing industry. But it is 
clear that the advertising and marketing industry has had an important part
in creating that culture. The big corporations that spend millions on 
advertising wouldn't be spending that kind of money without solid proof that
they were getting it back in increased sales. One member of FC met a sales
manager a couple of years ago who was frank enough to tell him, "our job
is to make people  buy things they don't want and don't need." He then
described how an untrained novice could present people with the facts about
a product, and make no sales at all, while a trained and experienced 
professional salesman would make lots of sales to the same peole. This 
shows that peole are manipulated into buying things they don't really want.
68. ...Psychological security does not closely correspond with physical
security. What makes us FEEL secure is not so much objective security as a
sense of confidence in our ability to take care of ourselves. Primitive man
threatened by a fierce animal or by hunger, can fight in self-defense or
travel in search of food. He has no certainty of success in these efforts,
but he is by no means helpless against the things that threaten him. The
modern individual on the other hand is threatened by many things against
which he is helpless: nuclear accidents, carcinogens in food, environmental
pollution, war, increasing taxes, invasion of his privacy by large 
organizations, nationwide social or economic phenomena that may disrupt his
way of life.
NOTE 12. The problem of purposeless seems to have become less serious during
the last 15 years or so, because people new feel less secure physically and
economically than they did earlier, and the need for security provides them
with a goal. But purposelessness has been replaced by frustration over the
difficulty of attaining security. We emphasize the problem of purposelessness
because the liberals and leftists would wish to solve our social problems 
by having society guarantee everyone's security; but if that could be done
it would only bring back the problem of purposelessness.
75. In primitive societies life is a succession of stages. The needs and
purposes of one stage having been fulfilled, there is no particular 
reluctance about passing on to the next stage...  it is not the primitive
man, who has used his body daily for practical purposes, who fears the
deterioration of age, but the modern man, who has never had a practical use
for his body beyond walking from his car to his house. It is the man whose
need for the power process has been satisfied during his life who is best
prepared to accept the end of that life.
76. In response... someone will say, "Society must find a way to give people 
the opportunity to go through the power process." For such people the value
of the opportunity is destroyed by teh very fact that society gives it to
them. What they need is to find or make their own opportunities. As long as
the system GIVES them their opportunities it still has them on a leash. To
attain autonomy they must get off that leash.
80. People vary in their succeptibility to advertising and marketing 
techniques. Some are so susceptible that, even if they make a great deal of
money they cannot satisfy their constant craving for the shiny new toys that 
the marketing industry dangles before their eyes. So they always feel hard-
pressed financially even if their income is large, and their cravings are
frustrated.
94. ...One does not have freedom if anyone else (especially a large 
corporation) has power over one, no moatter how benevolently, tolerantly
and permissively that power may be exercised. It is important not to confuse
freedom with mere permissiveness.

A 28TH CENTURY FABLE by Shadow
        This tale was reported by a tireless researcher in the Human
Archives, who noted its similarity with the earlier Robin Hood legends.
        Long ago, (in the days of the humans) a tyrannical technocracy of
scientists and their machines conspired to enslave the human race. In those
days there came a brave man they called the Unabomber who fought for 
humanity's future. He lived deep in the woods with his shadowy band of
co-conspirators called the Freedom Club. They say that he could be everywhere
at once, travelling all over the country to strike terror into the hearts
of the oppressors. Legends also tell of his skills as a mighty mountain man
who could hunt his own food in total darkness. They also say he may have had
a secret identity as a shy professor. The story tells that the "mystical and
awe-inspiring" Unabomber, after waging a long & lonely battle against 
overwhelming odds, finally forced the Corporate Powers to publish his 
written manifesto proclaiming the revolution at hand. But in the end, he was
betrayed by his own brother. They paraded him before the courts in chains
& shackles and decided his fate. But the legend of the Unabomber lives on to
this day!

We end this issue of ATI with 
JOURNAL POEM 3
        by prime anarchist. previously published in a 33-poem book of 
poetry entitled "I Slurp My Coffee." (c)1995

Old Pomes. New Pomes.
Borrowed pomes; blue pomes.
Funny pomes, sad pomes; goofy and glad pomes.
Pomes pomes. pomes pomes, eat them up - yum.

Make alliteration instead of legislation.
Ah, all's well that "and's" well-
And all are about action.
Skip, jump, lay there, run, smile, frown.
Run around, skip the jumping;
Lay there down.

Who chewed a page outa my pomes?
You're not s'posed to chew:
Eat them delicately.
Luscious, yummy, soft delicious yellow pomes.
Moist, meaty, mysterious succulent pomes.
Pomes about poets, presidents, pests
And pomes full of juice.
I eat pomes.
Do you eat pomes?
Red pomes, yellow pomes, green poems.
Don't eat the blue ones.
