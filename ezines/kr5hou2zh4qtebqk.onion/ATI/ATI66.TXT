A quick Clinton Quote and then I'll tell you a little about this month.
	"Music should push the limits. It really should be anarchy."
		-- George Clinton. 1997
February is fashion bashin' month.
No Barbies, no fur, no polo cologne. Every Friday, consider feeding fashion
models a nice big healthy filet-of-tofu. Take a supermodel to dinner. Make her
order more than lettuce salad with vinegar, cheezestuff sandwiches on white toast
and coffee.
Tell her she needs to gain some weight. She looks like a malnourished cow.
	Say it, it's February. Fashion bashin' month. Rest of the year you can
Buy clothes.                             / - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

LETTUCE FROM           -----------------/
OUR REE-DUHS:
Dear Prime:
Please send me a copy of your ATI. 
I'm not FBI, I promise.
                   Hope you like. Even if you were,
                   You know I'd send it to you.
                   Truth up. Word, to your 
                   Homequarters.
                   What---ever.
Hi Marc,
My name is Nate and I am a student at __________college in __________.
I'm working with a group of students on a school publication. our editor,
Samantha, is on the __________ newsgroup list and forwarded 
your post to me.
We are interested in learning more about how we can use the Internet as a 
means of publication. Could you please forward me a recent edition of ATI?
Thanks in advance.
                         Sure thing. You're welcome in advance. 
                         De Nada, I always say. Well,
                         most of the time. 
Dear Abbie,
Oh honey, you haven't e-mailed me in 22 hours. I know you're busy, Bubbe but the little one is falling
apart over here. He keeps doing yo-yo tricks saying "daddy does like this," "daddy does like so," and
he's only 3!!! Of course then he pees all over the TV every time Dan Rather comes on and I think how
much better my husband is at all this childraising stuff  than I.
	But you're out there doing the overthrow thing, toppling dictators, fighting for the underdog.
What will become of this country if you DO SUCCEED, Abbie. Maybe firehoses CANT stop you.
What then?? I see your footage on tele and then await your next email to "see" the real you again.
Missing you is hell, Abbie. TV viewers think you have all the answers. They follow you like disciples to Christ or sheep to David ben Jesse. And there you just wanna smoke pot, talk politics, 
and build illegal web-sights.
	Write your son Abbie, he loves you. As do I. A day and a half without your system-chat
commands or sideways smiles and winks is torture for us. What will become of the US after Gingrich
gets impeached gives way to thoughts of what will become of us.
	There. I've hammered you with more than your share of that shallow jewish guilt/love stuff.
Maybe you'll never write back. See there I go.
	I love you,
	A-
                         "Wow," says Prime
                          I couldn't have written a
                          Better fiction myself. ;--)

In case you still wanted 
this for your newsletter.
Peace,
Shelly.

          And now part II of the Weisenheimer Document
          ----------------------------------------------------------------
Weisenheimer and Compressionism. (Cont from ATI 65)
THE PARTICLE POETS
A similar phenomenon was pressing on in the field of poetry between the late 1990's and now. Compressionism took its shape in poetry much the same way it did in painting. Words were collected up from time immemorial then mooshed down into compressed "pulp" phrases that seemed to say almost nothing, at first read. Further study would show that they took at least a little thought to build.
	In the example "Ode to Odes" by the still famous Franco-American poet Carello Sands Burgero, at first it seems to make no sense whatsoever:

Ode to ode an ode an.
I Splendid how odes of ode.
Ode odic an what oh, and odes to ode, my.
Ago centuries 21 it received I
Is this "my ode" ode odious;

	Further study shows that if you read Burgero's "Ode" backwards it makes a little more sense.
	Hence:

This is my ode to odes.
Odious ode my ode, this is.
I received it 21 centuries ago,
My ode to odes, and oh, what an odic ode.
Ode of odes, how splendid is
An ode to an ode to odes.

	Particle Comprssionism came to the fore in the work of such poets as Burgero as well as Neil P. Eugene (1990-2007) J. Edgar Oem (1988-2025) and Allen Kernsberg (1941-pres.) Kernsberg, Oem and Burgero were all trained at the Virginese schools, but all felt it only fair that they do with words what others were doing with brushes. Like paintings, some of these poems found some unusual things on the pages right from the poets' heads. In "The Winged Creature" by J. Edgar Oem legend has it that Oem's manuscript contains actual illustrations on every other page using decoupaged composted vegetables right out of his kitchen. Modern technology kept the texture and the smells in each print but managed to keep the bacteria from traveling book to book. By the turn of the century, programmers had gotten really good at debugging such virus'. No one has seen Oem's original manuscript after publication of the copies distributed. Rumor has it that the entire book of galley sheets is under his wife's Corsican mint patch in their herb garden.
	A little must be said about Neil P. Eugene who in 1990 was born in a cottage in New Japan, Connecticut. That would suffice.
COMPRESSIONISM IN MUSIC
Music was very important to all the Compressionists, not just the recomposers and song splicers. Painting was done to fully orchestrated music; poetry was read aloud to such musical instruments as the Black & Decker drill, Norelco's Dial-A-Bean, and of course La Machine.
	Car stereos became obsolete at the turn of the century along with cellular phones, as people began wearing both on their wrist in a multi-purpose device called the  Sony "Hand Stand Man." It allowed people to fax, phone and groove to old Grateful Dead songs while doing light calisthenics: all the necessities of the modern american workforce worker.
	Compressionism reflected this in its popular music in the '00's.
	"What Do You Want Me To Do, A Hand Stand, Man?" was the most popular song in 2002 and it managed to remain anonymous until 2007 when style sleuths were able to detect that the rhyme scheme was similar to another by Marc Weisenheimer. He was charged with 1 count of e-mailing  a song on the internet without a Handel, and let go on grounds that the song was necessary with or without credit whether it lacks prurient interest or not.
	Even though the song wasn't made in Virgin, it got him $4000 and is still popular as today's' most important work anthem, second only to  The Who's "We're Not Gonna Take It."
	Other composers true to the Compressionist genre were Warm Milk (1998-pres) Gangsta M.C. (short for Mozart Christ) (1990-2005) Spinning Light (2000-pres) and L.M.N.P. Cool Musician (1975-2005)
	It can be said Compressionist music comes from many styles but mostly from a cross between Gregorian Harmonies and Baroque MegaPolyphony. Cool Musician was called to do a Miller Light beer commercial last year and poked harmless fun at Compresssionism when he was heard saying "Sounds Baroque; Tastes like chicken."
	A little more ought be said about Marc Weisenheimer who was born 1964 in Rotten Villa, England; then moved to Virgin, Virginia in 1003 to see the beginning of Compressionism. That's enough.

SCHOOL OF THE AMERICAS by Shelly Stern. 6feb97
School of the Americas. When I first heard the phrase I tried to imagine what this place could be about. Was it an institution of higher education that initiates and encourages dialogue between our northern and southern neighbors? Was it a non-profit organization that taught the true history of our continents? I was pretty optimistic with the fairly inclusive title. This did not leave me fully prepared for the hidden truths I was soon to discover. All I had to hear was the title of the video "School of the Assassins" and I knew I was in for some grim news. Once again I learned how our government is undoubtedly responsible for the deaths of thousands of people in Latin America. Our tax money is going to support torture, rape and murder.  
	The school of the Americas (SOA) has been in existence for about 50 years now; first in Panama to ultimately "combat" communism and today in Fort Benning, Georgia to essentially crush socialist thought. It wasn't some ignorant soul who one day decided that the "School of the Assassins" was a better name for the place, but rather a passionate reaction to the discovery that graduates from the school were committing disgusting acts of violence on their own people. SOA students aren't taking Non-violent Conflict Resolution Skills: 101 or even a mediocre leadership course like I might have hoped. These people are taught "how-can-I-get-away-with-torturing-raping-killing-entire-villages-of-peasants-who-are-becoming-empowered-by-an-honest-liberation-theology-driven-church-worker-and-get-away-with-it: 101." Let's face it, with former panamanian dictator, Manuel Noriega as an "honored" graduate, what more do we need to concur that something is just a little bit corrupt with the activities of SOA?
