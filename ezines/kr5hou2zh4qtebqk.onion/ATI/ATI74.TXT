CHILDREN OF WOOD AND METAL
        by Shadow. (ed note: this is a very long piece. It will show in
                    the next 5-20 issues as a saga. Consider it a good
                    alternative to the Starwars mega-ilogy)
   He had never had any children, and he probably never would,
this ragged man named Ted Kaczmaryk who rode a junkyard bicycle.
Nevertheless, he was intimately acquainted with the immensity of life and
death on this planet. He was a very creative man.
   His mind was in a ferment today as he peddled up the hill toward his
cabin. He'd spent all day at the town library, catching up on the world's 
news. One article in particular haunted him. He could not get it out of 
his mind as he labored up Stemple Pass Road.
   A yellow school bus was stopped by the cluster of mailboxes, disgorging
a horde of children. One of them waved to Ted, who recognized the boy as
Dan, the librarian's son. Ted lifted a finger in return, but did not 
speak (ed note: that is "way" montana/colorado/arizona) Two other boys 
turned to stare at him. There goes that weirdo, said one to the other,
and they both laughed.
      TO BE CONTINUED IN ATI 75 NEXT WEEK.

1955. (right about the same time MacDonalds sold their first thousand.)

PART IV OF MARC FRUCHT'S GUIDE TO THE UNABOMBER'S MANIFESTO.
Previously Published in paper form December 1995. Timed but oh so timely.

95. It is said that we live in a free society because we have a certain
number of constitutionally guaranteed rights. But these are not as
important as they seem. The degree of personal freedom that exists in a 
society is determined more by the economic and technological structure of
the society then by its laws or its form of government.
NOTE 16. When the American colonies were under British rule there were
fewer and less effective guarantees of freedom than there were after the
American Constitution went into effect, yet there was more personal freedom
in pre-industrial America, both before and after the War of Independence 
than there was after the Industrial Revolution took hold in this country...
95. (con't) Most of the Indian nations of New England were monarchies, and
many of the cities of the Italian Renaissance were controlled by dictators.
But in reading about these societies one gets the impression that they
allowed far more personal freedom than our society does...
97. Constitutional rights are useful up to a point, but they do not serve
to guarantee much more than what might be called the bourgeois conception
of freedom. According to the bourgeois conception a "free" man is 
essentially an element of a social machine and has only a certain set of 
prescribed and delimited freedoms; freedoms that are designed to serve the
needs of the social machine more than those of the individual... But what
kind of freedom does one have if one can use it only as someone else 
prescribes? FC's conception of freedom is not that of ... bourgeois
theorists. (I almost spelled that terrorist, had to do a doubletake)
The trouble with such Theorists is that they have made the development and 
application of social theories their surrogate activity. Consequently the
theories are designed to serve the needs of the theorists more than the needs
of any people who may be unlucky enough to live in a society on which the
theories are imposed.
(CONTINUED NEXT ISSUE)(For those just joining in, and others keep in mind:
this is just a primer. I've picked the ones that I think we need to know of.
I've left out the ones the Washington Post and New York Times picked that
didn't seem to make sense, kept in the most important 4500 words. T'least
that's MY opinion. Read the whole thing please and make up your own mind.
I urge you NOT TO BELIEVE ME BLINDLY OR THE OTHER PRESSES.)

JOURNAL POEM 5 previously published in a UCONN quarterly under a true name.
fall '95.
Woman wearing topaz bolo tie
Dismantles her "NO TRESPASSING"
Unfurls her new "NO SKATEBOARDING."

Cooling off by a fake waterfall
I watch lead, rhythm and bass 
Zylophonists play "Not what it used 
To Be," their final cut-
Slices thru my heart like Swiss Army
Sawblade thru sun-melted butter.
Hold the Coke and smile, I want
RC Cola and a wince.

Slept thru half an Eagles song-
Woke up; clock saying 1189 p.m.-
2 many people w/ fake black hair-
1st Ronald McDonald was vegetarian-
Guess I woke up on the wrong side of-
The driver's seat: damn those digitals.

Dale Carnegie once said, "Plan for 
The worst -- and hope for the best."
"This isn't a bagel," he said once 
Too, "It's white bread with a hole."

Inchworms are the same, the world over:
Just a little different in size.
