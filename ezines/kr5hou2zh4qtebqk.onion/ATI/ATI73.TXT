Subject: La vuelta a InterNet en 80 virus. Parte III
The instruments of darkness tell us truths...
	WilliamShakespeare. Macbeth.
Usuario:BFY qu&eacute; m&aacute;s hay en Internet que se pueda transfer ir por FTP?
Cracker: Virus vivos y muertos.
Hacker: =A1Ya c&aacute;llate, Cracker!
Amigo (usuario Avanzado): =A1Sopas! =BFOtra vez no lo vas a dejar hablar? C: No, ahora el que no va a hablar es el Hacker...
H: =BFPara qu&eacute; es esa cuerda? =A1No! =A1Esp&eacute;rate! =A1No! =A1= Manita de puerco, no!
=A1No me amarres! A1No! BFPara qu&eacute; es ese trapo? A1Nooooh mmm
C: =A1Listo! As&iacute;, amarrado y amordazado, no vas a dar lata.
H: =A1Mgrhmmmm!
U: =BFY c&oacute;mo est&aacute; eso de los virus vivos y muertos?
BFLos muertos son los virus que ya no existen? BFLos que ya no se usan?
	=BFAlgo as&iacute; como el Lat&iacute;n es una "lengua muerta"?
C: No, a esos se les llama virus "extintos".
Los virus "vivos" est&aacute;n en c&oacute;digo ejecutable (programas .exe o .com),
mientras que los "muertos" est&aacute;n en "papel" (en listados fuente).
A: Los virus vivos se pueden activar o infectar f&aacute;cilmente con s&o= acute;lo
	ejecutar el programa...
C: S&iacute;, incluso los programas antivirus checadores de virus (Scanne= rs)
	pueden detectar los virus en los programas ejecutables,
	pero NO de los archivos de programas fuente en "Assembler".
A: Pero es que esos virus est&aacute;n "muertos" porque requieren ser "traducidos"
	o "ensamblados" a ejecutables...
U: En ese caso, ser&iacute;an virus "latentes", =BFno?
C: S&iacute;, bueno, el chiste es que No est&aacute;n "vivos".
U: =BFY por FTP podemos "traernos" virus vivos?
C: S&iacute;, inadvertidamente en un programa infectado, je je,
o de un lugar como por ejemplo el que no me dej&oacute; decir el Hacker
	el mes pasado: del usuario Chaos en Kaiwan...
H: =A1Nfffsss!...
U: =BFY no es peligroso tener virus vivos?
C: Es peligroso para quien no le gusta el peligro... Adem&aacute;s del riesgo "tonto" de auto-contagio, 
existe el riesgo de ser atrapado en la "cacer&iacute;a de brujas" contra pornograf&iacute;a, virus y dem&aacute;s "vicios"...
H: =A1Tppprr!
C: No te creo que no tengas vicios...
Bueno, comencemos a dar direcciones porque sino nos apuramos, se acaba el espacio, o los quitan, o cambian de lugar... 
como el ftp.u.washington.edu/public/alt.cyberpunk =A1que desapareci&oacute;!
A: =BFY cu&aacute;les NO han desaparecido?
C: Por ejemplo en server.netcom.com/pub/br/bradleym/ el usuario Bradleym tiene fuentes de virus en el directorio virus-source.
U: =A1Virus muertos!
C: =A1Andale! Adem&aacute;s tiene revistas electr&oacute;nicas sobre virus
	en el directorio Zines, revistas muy "buenas" como 40hex,
	CryPt, NuKE, IR Immortal_Riot y VLAD.
H: =A1Pddgggttt!!!
U: Este... =BFNo querr&aacute; opinar?
C: Pues ya est&aacute; opinando.
	Otro excelente lugar es paris.fc.net/pub/deadkat
	en el que est&aacute; el "uNDERGROUND zINE aRCHIVE", o sea
	el "Archivo de revistas subterr&aacute;neas".
A: Pues si el usuario es un "Gato muerto", tiene que estar bajo tierra, BF no?
C: S&iacute;, jeje. Pues siendo este el art&iacute;culo de Noviembre, estamos con los "t&eacute;tricos" temas de virus muertos
	y la obscuridad de la noche de brujas.
U: =BFTrato o truco?
A: =BFTranza o trampa?
H: =A1Nchtrrrr!
C: En el lugar del gato muerto, en el subdirectorio hacking
hay much&iacute;simas revistas electr&oacute;nicas sobre el arte del "hackeo",
	como ATI Activist Times Incorporated, Digital_Murder, FBI...

								 
Welcome to ATI. Activist Times, Inc. It is Sunday. April 6, 1 a.m. 
You are reading issue #73.

There is no numbers run this week. Keep playing with the last ones I'd say.
Oh, and send any neat ones you find here. (marco99@juno.com (hint, hint.))
ATI GIVING COOL LINKS SINCE 1989.

CALENDULAR SECTION is rather short too. I've been lazy in the research
department. In fact, I'll put all the dates here within the Primenotes and
then return to some editorializing before I get you into the stories. Oh, 
there's also only one letter to the editor this week. We were at an 
average of 3 which was pretty exciting. Anyone feel like sending one in?
(ibid-hint, ibid-hint.)

April 14-18 is the journalism conference I was hoping to go to in Havana
Cuba. Shall have to try for next year's.
24th to 30th of same month is International Turn Off your TV Week. If anyone
wants to write a story about what it was like to watch no tellie, lemme know.

Allen Ginsberg died the other day. I was hoping the old guy would never die.
Oh well. If anyone gets his rent fix apartment, please donate it to ATI.
It's right up the hall from where TAP and YIPL used to be put out. And
you-all know Prime Anarchist here sees himself as the national youngest 
yipster of the year, yadda, yadda, Thank Yawveh!!!

So here's a moment of silence for Mr. Dare-To-Be-Gay's passing.
							    
							 
							      
							      
							     
							   !
									
							   
							    
					     Oy
						 
					     
				      
				 
				 Feck.



			    
That's the closest to a Kaddish 'ya gonna get from this prime anarchist.
Farewell, Allen Ginsberg. Body gone, your muse lives on. 

WANNA READ SOME BULLSHIT? DEPARTMENT. by Anarchist Prime.
"CANYON HOTEL?" reprinted from ARIZONA HIGHWAYS Magazine. January 1962.
						      FORTY CENTS

...In last month's beautiful issue of AH, I noted with interest the concern
expressed by some readers over the possibility of a new hotel being built on
the South Rim of the Grand Canyon. Lest your readers think that we are
callous destroyers of nature, I would like to explain our position.
	Western Gold & Uranium, Inc., has for some time been carrying on
very profitable mining operations on the claim in question. It is our
desire and intent to continue mining, but in order to do so we will have to
rely on our extralateral rights under laws which enable us to mine under
government-owned land adjacent to ours. In order to avoid costly litigation,
our company has offered to give the government a deed to the entire claim.
We are willing to do this in return for mining rights for 35 years. (ed note:
YOUR TIME IS UP. GET THE *&%$ OFF THAT LAND BEFORE YOU DESTROY THE REST OF
THIS PLANET) If our offer is accepted, we can mine ore that we feel we 
already have a right to mine, and the government will acquire, at no cost,
all surface and subsurface rights to our patented claim. No hotel will then
be built...
	... You see, we do not want to build a hotel. We are a public
corporation, however and we have a duty to our stockholders... (blah, blah)
... We will build the hotel to accomplish this end, but only as an 
undesired alternative to mining our claim. If Uncle Sam will let us mine,
we will mine. If he forces us to build a hotel, we will build a beautiful
one...
BRILLIANT ANALOGY DEPARTMENT...
Anyone who has lived on that land or has relatives or friends out there,
<raising hand for 2 or 3 of those> will see these two choices (bigger mines
vs. new resort hotel) the same way they'd see these two choices:
"I can rape you or shove this rattlesnake up your butt."

1. Dial Campus Switchboard Operator. (dial -0)
2. Identify yourself- giving your full name.
3. Give city calling.
4. Give complete telephone # including area code.
If outside operator needed or assisted phone calls--
Follow directions.

...which amuses us every day and encourages us to continue. Every night
from 19h30 to 20h00 (state news time) all over the city people come to
their windows and balconies and make unresistable noise with whistles, 
kitchen equipment, loudspeakers, chainsaws and drills... so it becomes
impossible that anyone follows the lies on state news because of the noise.
(ed note: Belgrade, Yugoslavia if you didn't already figure that out.)
For those of you from out of town, we all look mad and lunatic, but we
are having a lot of fun. With this action, demonstrations happen all over
and not only on central streets and all those who didn't know or didn't want
to know about it finally know what is happening. With all these actions
Belgrade seems the most interesting place in the world to be right now.
Other towns in Serbia are maybe not that active and interesting but it is 
important that protests and marches continue there as well (Nis, Kraljevo,
Valjevo, Pirot...) They also keep police dispersed.

Did anyone hear Dark Tangent on National Public Radio Last Wednesday?
Yeah, 2:30 p.m. on Talk of the Nation with Ray Suarez. (hope I spelled his
name right. Oh well.)
Mostly he was plugging his umpteenth annual Defcon in Las Vegas.

I'm about as interested in going to Defcon in LV as I would what with 
going to see the Grateful Dead (with OR without) Jerry in LV. Hmmm. 
Let's parachute in this summer.

PART 3 OF MARCO'S GUIDE TO THE UNABOMBER'S MANIFESTO

72. Modern society is in certain respects extremely permissive. In matters
that are irrelevant to the functioning of the system we can generally do
what we please. We can believe in any religion we like (as long as it does
not encourage behavior that is dangerous to the system). We can do anything
we like as long as it is UNIMPORTANT. But in all IMPORTANT matters the 
system tends increasingly to regulate our behavior.
(tune in next time when we analyze 95, 97, 114, 123, note 19, 125, and 127
of unabom's megamanual on the meaning of life.)
