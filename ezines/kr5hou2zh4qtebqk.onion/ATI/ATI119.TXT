Hi hi. Prime Anarchist here. We got lots of mail. Some will have to 
carry over to next week. Many compliments about the latest parodies,
so let's next with another...

                This to the tune of:
           THE JUICY FRUIT GUM COMMERCIAL
  from Mark Weisenheimer's album Hootenany Green. 1988.

             In the morning wakin' up
             Pour a box of meuselix;
             The taste is gonna move you.

             Get your nuts,
             Eat 'em whole;
             The taste is gonna move ya
             When you're sittin' on the bowl.

             Meuselix, is gonna move ya.
             Lotsa fiber - it goes right through ya.
             Meuselix. The taste, the taste;
             The taste is gonna. 
             Moooooooove ya.

And now, a Poem by Marc Frucht.

SWASTIKAS  dedicated to Tara.
Gangsta swastikas all over the place.
G.D. Folks. In your face, dude.
Vice Lord Folks put swastika on bathroom stall.
Crip and Blood gangbangin from way back - y'all.
Swastikas, token of our symbolic hurt.
Spray it, draw it - chalk it down.
Plaster it on with tape.
Krylon, nylon.
An artist swastika all about town.

Swastikas, swastikas, neo Amerikkkan swastikas,
A crip swa- on your door.
Nazi one on your lawn -- tall.
Christian one on your forehead.
Blood, your sickle eats my ass.
Latin Ladies lay eggs all around.
Ovulating near a crip, hopin' 4 a
West Side 7 story baby 2 gether.
Fiddler on the Effin' roof.
Bad boys, bad boys, Helicopter's gonna do...
Do you up the Association.
Police swastikas all over your
DARE graduation.

Army swastika. Signal corps, 2 B precise.
I trim my mustach to within regs.
Shave it off violently shouting -
I look like Adolph Effin' Hitler.
Big gang - Army.
Big gang - Po-lice.
Boy Scout swastika 3 fingers up.
Vice Lord war red and blue - 2
Fingers up and back...
2 fingers down / Some body kill him.
Up your kilt. Flip a bird.
Your naughty swastika.
Point out Salmon Rush Die.
A Fatwa Swastika.
Cop swa, big gang. Army swa, big gang.

Crip swa, Blood swa, Latin King swa.
G-D swa. Vice Lord swa, Folks again.
Swa, swa. Swa, swa; swa.

Kokopeli my swastika of choice.

Toot your OWN horn.

E L E T E L E P H O N Y  - by Laura E. Richards.

\Once  there was  an   elephant.   \
 \Who tried to  use the  telephant- \
  \No!  No!  I  mean the  elephone   \
   \Who tried to  use the  telephone- \
    \(Dear me!  I am not  certain quite\
     \That even  now  I've got it right)\
      \                                  \
       \Howe'er it was,  he got his  trunk\
        \Entangled  in  the  telephunk;    \
         \The more he tried to get it phree,\
          \The louder buzzed  the telephee-  \
           \(I fear I'd better drop  the song \
            \Of elephop and telephong!)        \

I added a link to Common Dreams 2000 on the 'NO MORE OIL WARS'  page I
have added to "Green Parties of North
America".   I   think the Union of Concerned Scientists   said it best
back in '91: "this is an armed conflict over terms of
access to oil."  All the stuff about how awful or threatening Saddam
Hussein is is just hype.  The USA has no problem
with its minions doing exactly what he does. Saddam's crime is the same
as Noriegas' was: he stopped taking orders
from his handlers in the CIA. But his crime was also more fearful than
Noriega's was: he developed his third world
colonial holding into an independent regional economy with a good
(before the war) standard of living and out of reach
of the IMF and World Bank.  That's why Iraq had to be hit harder than
Panama.


I have to say I like those text files...quite funny. This is something that
should possibly be on Mancow's Morning Madhouse. Well, anyway, I said I would
send you a few links.

Happy Birthday Dr. Soos. by Prime Anarchist
The cat in the hat was phat.
She spat on Pat. What's that?
My pet gnat.
Pet gnat has no hat.
That's a gnat without a hat;
A hatless gnat.
For if he were a hatted gnat,
The fatted cat would eat the gnat.
Snd so it goes. And
So it goes.
A vegetarian cat in a fat old hat
Who seldom eats neither gnat nor rat

And, if that ain't all...

The fatted hatted Pat spitting cat,
Ate the rat's hat.
It was high in fiber, porous,
And full of greens.

"CLIFF PALACE, MESA VERDE, COLORADO.
   The most remarkable aspect of this largest
and best-preserved ruin in the Southwest is that
some gangster real estate goon has not convinced
the Indians to turn it into a fucking casino.

NEWSPAPER ROCK, THE PAINTED DESERT, ARIZONA.
   These petroglyphs are believed to be the work 
of the Anasazi, a Native American people inhabiting
southern Colorado and Utah and northern New Mexico
and Arizona from about A.D. 100 and whose descendants
are the present-day Pueblo peoples.
   We arrest assholes in New York City for drawing
this kind of shit on subway cars."
