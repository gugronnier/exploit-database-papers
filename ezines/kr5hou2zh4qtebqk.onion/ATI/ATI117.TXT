Hello, and welcome to ATI issue 117. Sunday, February 22, 1998.
In the year of our Olympic Training Center.
I'm prime anarchist and by way of introduction I move you
right to the last part of the 1992 Infinite Onion reprint.
David Fischer interviews Prime Anarchist during a quick break
from his walk across the country.

IO: What is the fuel of the revolution, is it rice?
PA: The fuel of the revolution is not rice, but you are close. It was
a tossup between foodstamps and saline and saline won. Seems in the US
these days, if you have a conscience the only way you can afford to
speak out on anything is you gotta plas. (if you live in a state where
plasma distribution is not yet legal, you won't know the expression
"plassing;" which is donating two pints of your cells in exchange for 
$13 and free donuts and coffee.

IO: Wow. That's harsh. 
PA: Removing myself from the system means I have to live way under the
poverty line, and without any property puts us at a big disadvantage
unless we learn to be communal. And guess who can teach us this?

IO: I don't know but I bet you're going to tell me...
PA: The 900,000 Native Americans who somehow managed to live through
this holocaust so far. So there's a lot of Anne Frank diaries, huh?
Get involved in a native rights group. Help chop wood or live with a
family. Let them help you get YOUR roots though. Don't take their
religion! You let your government take everything else they have, don't
take their spirit. Just let them inspire you. Help them brainstorm.
Get involved.

IO: Yeah, I've been there.
PA: The native American bros and sisters will wake you up. Next step is
smashing your TV set and taking back your life. Get out of the fogging
mall and start making your own jewelry and clothes.

IO: Any other comments? Things you want to say?
PA: Yes, thanks for the interview. Pray for peace. We're all related.
That's all for now.

                  This interview was reprinted 
                        from Issue # ate
                   of Infinite Onion Magazine.




Since it's pretty obvious that Clinton basically took the 
"baton" from Bush, and is now doing the CIA operative's 
(once a... always a...) bidding, now is a great time to come 
forward with something that was handed to me by a kind woman 
on the capitol steps october 7, 1992. 
   It was an advance copy of George Bush's victory speech. 
(yes, he really expected to win.) It might as well be Clinton's 
"victory" speech, or any 7 of his state of the onion addresses if he feels
like just respitting something old and  re-pertinent. hint, hint...

         GEORGE BUSH'S PLANNED VICTORY SPEECH FOR 1992. 
                NOW MORE APROPRIATE THAN EVER.
            typed in by Prime Anarchist Productions. 
                    February, 20, 1998 

     My fellow Americans, I stand here before you proud to accept 
the honor and challenge of my second term as President of the 
greatest nation on earth and leader of the Free World. In the first 
four years, we completed our policy of containment, engineered a 
peaceful displacement of communism, and ushered in a New World
Order.
    In central america, we helped install fledgling democracies whose 
governments regularly hold free elections. In Panama, we rid the 
hemisphere of a dangerous demagogue; in Nicaragua, which fell under
the control of radical-nationalists, we restored democracy; and in 
nearby Cuba, we continue to work toward  neutralizing Fidel Castro.
    Around the globe, especially in Eastern Europe, we helped newly 
liberated peoples to see the benefits of the market and privatization. 
    In the Middle East I advanced the peace process by leading America 
to a spectacular victory in the Persian Gulf War. With few casualties, 
we were able to save Kuwait and uphold the principle of opposing aggression.
Now, Kuwait, and Saudi Arabia, are independent and both nations can 
pursue their evolution toward democracy at their own pace.
    Our task, however, is not finished. Saddam remains defiant despite 
the pummeling we gave him in Operation Desert Storm. Even now, he is 
rebuilding his army, only a short time ago the 3rd largest in the 
world., and making threats and thus requiring us to exercise our 
right to self-defense. In short, our national security still requires
vigilence and a prudent level of defense expenditures.
    Although we must prepare for all eventualities, we will look 
first to negotiations and diplomacy to restore stability around the 
globe. If, however, we are challenged by bullies, we will not shrink 
from using force.

    Here at home, I will continue to be president to all the people. 
I pledge never to bow to special interests, but instead, to always 
seek and ever serve our national interest. For we are a compassionate 
nation and, in this time of temporary economic malaise, we must reach 
out to the poor and encourage them to free themselves from the burden 
of food stamps, Medicare, and the dole. We must end dependency on these
ensnaring safety nets and replace them with economic trampolines to 
propel the homeless and the unemployed to new heights of self-esteem 
and success.
    But I want to make it perfectly clear, that if we are to reduce 
inequality, eliminate the deficit, win the war on drugs, and rebuild 
our cities, our first step must be to cut the capital gains tax so 
that those most able to help the less fortunate will be able to do 
just that.
    My fellow Americans, as we enter this, my second term as president, 
and march together, bound by common values, the United States of 
America will once again be an example to all the world. With God's
help we will internationalize the thousand points of light and we 
will make them millions of glowing embers of democracy.
    In closing, my fellow Americans, I pledge four more years of the 
same, only better.


And how, George Bush. You said a mouthful, toots.

                                   by the way
                          I verified the truth of this
                            intended speech right after
                             I'd gotten it through
                            Covert Action Quarterly, 
                                El Monde, and 
                           Linda Lovelace's official

PARODY TIME.

To the tune of Riding On The City Of New Orleans
as sung by Arlo Guthrie
parody by prime anarchist. denver. 1995

Riding on the city bus this morning
Dollar-50 just to ride to work. 
Smell of diesel fuel just makes me nauseous
There's no bathroom just a window that doesn't work.

All along the trip to work I thought
About the car I never bought
& I coulda gotten there faster if I'd jogged.
Making stops at every spot
Picking up every old sot
Maybe I'd'a just rather had been flogged.

Good morning America how are you
Your transportation system really sucks.
If I walked to work I'd have prob'ly gotten there faster.
I'd rather hitch a ride with an ice cream truck.


Here's another. See if you can guess the original just 
from the rhythm. OK here's the chord chart just in case.

Bb    Bb-maj-7     Bb6     Eb
Bb
Cm7     F7      Bb
Gm7    C7    F7     Bb     Bb-maj7
Bb6      Eb    D7
Eb-maj7      Bb      Gm7    Cm7
F7     Bb

Look for that NAFTA label
When you are buying some cheap cologne.
Remember job search. Our unions looking
While jobs are going to Mexico
And further south.
We're all broke now, but who's complaining.
Thanks to the NAFTA we're starving today.
So always look for that NAFTA label
It says we're ruining the USA
(you better believe it.)
We're ruining the U-S-A.


OK this one's a cute little short one.
I'll just give you the notes.
c-d-ee-f-g-a-d   d-f-e-d-e-c-c  e-c-c

probably your favorite chocolate commercial...
C O LL A P S E 
NAFTA makes it happen quickly
G O P


OK and tha's my final offer...

G Em C D

Does your chewing gum lose its flavor
On the bed post over nite.
When your mother says don't chew it
Do you swallow it on site.
Or do ya reach from under the table
Stick it in your mouth and say "yum!"
Oooh ABC gum.

Does your mind get tired of tuning in 
that propaganda stuff
When CNN says things around
Wall street are getting rough
Do you reach for television
Kick it in the tube n say ooh,
Ooh ABC sucks.


OK folks, help me complete one here.
Yeah, group effort. Send all ideas, inputs
brainstorms, cerebral el ninos to:

ati@etext.org

This is to the tune of Islands In the Stream.

When I began songwriting there were songs to sing. 
Well written stuff out there and every thing
But it's different now. Now there's nothing going on.

It's a strange (phenomenon) that I can't explain.
Years without some music for my ears is pain.
Everything coming out, sounds like it is 10 years old.

Tender love songs hold; no need for celebration.
MTV's new sounds simply require (parody-eye-ation)
We wait for new music    uh-huh

(here's where it gets really weak, help me out here)
Like making love with no partner uh huh
Generation X that is what we are
Fans without a dream where do we belong 
Sail away with me to another world.
Where the musicians don't sound like all the others.
From one songwriter to another, uh huh

(OK I really like this part, but will gladly change it 
if anyone has better ideas...)

I ain't heard a song that ha'nt been plagiarammed
Everything is rehashed like a can of spam
Or maybe diet spam
Slowly losing sight of a new sound
Everybody thinks they have the newest hit
Ask my opinion it just sounds like
OK diet spam, this could be the year for the new spam.
No more will you spam
Baby boomers crooning soon
We start and end with nothing new. 
We can...

A February Poem For You. By Prime Marco Anarchist

A stalk of brussels sprouts
Poked thru the melting snow.
Sun beating down making for
Glistening beads of dew dripping 
Down to the roots.

Reaching out I spy a spider,
A gray little old man
Of a spider runs away.
My warning? I think...
Should you eat a brussels sprout
Coming up on March?

Is there a month or a day when they're
Poisonous?
Like some of the others?

Never I mind. It's mildewey looking afterall.
Kind of rotten.
Ready to be turned in.
I toss it aside just as it
Tumbles crumbly out of hand.

A stalk of brussels sprouts
Poked thru the melting snow this spring-  
And me?
I was too late to eat.


THIS ONE'S SHORT LIKE ME.
She went into the circle
For the circle ate her.
Chewed her like a chocolate shekel
And spit her out like a percolator.



Here's a couple more short ones to commemorate 
February, the shortest month. 

POPEYE   by Marco
I am, I am;
Iambic's what I am.


DEAD KENNEDY by the same

Jello likes short songs;
As I with small poems.



 CONDO SONATA IN V FLAT
   by Prime Anarchist

I.
Your neighbor buys one of those commercial flag and poles
And you think you gotta have one.
You throw yours away after 2/3 of the dwellers all have them.
You see someone else has a vault-for-valuables-thingie 
That goes disguised as a rock in case you forget your key.
You'll keep that one well past its catch-on over-popularity.
"Everybody" but you has one of those plastic bootscrapers
Next to their Valkomen matt. 
You follow suit.
Almost 2/3 of you have one now.
The kitchen witch.
The big window-mercury-meter.
The Ginsu knife, the bowler's crying towel.
Same for the golfer.
The LaMachine.

II.
Worm who tried to cross the sidewalk:
Windburn?
Sunburn?
What hardened you?
Petrified?
How you died?
2/3 of the way across,
Almost made it to the sand-
Too late.
Rain might've helped.
Or is that what drove you out in the --
First place.
Did you run out of water,
Air
Nitrogen.
Parched like Arizona mud in mid May or July.

III.
This poem is 2/3 done.
Or should I have EVEN pointed that OUT?
You guessed it.
Could've made your own
Connections.
Can you drive on farther
Without
A car
Or a condo
Or even
A Cuisinart?

Subject: Anarchist Cookbook

Does this cookbook accept submissions?  If so, I have a 
delightfully- light tuna cassarole recipe that one can whip 
up in less than 15 minutes, all from common household ingredients.
Where do I write to contact the publishers?
Regarding the "anarchy-theme" of the cookbook, this is no problem.
You outa see the condition of my kitchen after an 
exciting morning of cooking!
