RE: excited.

6:40pm Wisconsin Time. Friday. 
I was watching Fashion Television on VH-1 tonight and on came a few of your
subvertisements.
The last one before going back to the show was the skinny girl vomiting into
the toilet. 
Great job, people. 
I really appreciated it.
That's the first round of Adbusters ads I've seen here in Wisconsin.
It was very exciting.

FLASHIMOTO!
   Prime Anarchist Returns Below Ground.
   Anarchist had so much trouble with tails, spooks, geeks, pheds, phish-
heads, war mongers, and assorted other Dennis Rodman look-alikes he has
made the editorial decision to un-surface.
   So Marc Frucht was NOT the Prime Anarchist; forget you'd ever heard that. 
Nor was Marc Weisenheimer, Marco Capelli, Norris Admonton or even Fry Guy.
   With Anarchist will go the infamous Prime Anarchist Phamily Photo Album.
   "You couldn't get it for the last two years anyhow," Said Anarchist. He
went on to neither confirm nor deny the reputed second printing of the 
album in the future. "If another printing happens," said Anarchist, "It wont
come out of MY house."
   Will ATI continue on into the 80's, 90's and "zero's," you might be
wondering. Well, Anarchist put on  his best Buddhist accent for this 
response. "But of course!" he hoarsely said waving his right hand from his
out toward his right ear. "Only the new publisher will be Cerberus."
He said he will still put out a weekly column from within Cerberus' all new
3-headed ATI.
   "I'm the voice of the community around here," said old 6-eyes. "Prime
thinks he's a moderate, but he's kind of out there. We'll let him columnize
a bit. Rant, if you will, but the rest of the 11 or 12K I'll be editing."
Cerberus added that Anarchist will stay on as contributing editor of the
PAP run, and along with his columnizing will also run the all new Current
"ebb and flow" Affairs desk.

SPY MAKES ME COVER MY MOUTH WHEN I LAUGH.
   Not to be polite. I'm afraid I'll spit up a mouth full of iced-tea. (not
the rock star, the drink. (not the mixed drink of long island fame, the 
soft drink. Use hard water though. 2 softs is overkill.))
   This month's Spy Gray Area column deals with Irony in true Alanisism
fashion. Peter Townsend receiving medical treatment after penning "Hope I
die before I get old."
   Dave "Wendy's" Thomas having quadruple bypass surgery.
   Who is Susan "16-years-no-emmy" Lucci???
   Cover your mouth. It's that funny.


FLASH. COUNTERFLASH.
        Mike Royko and Allen Ginsberg are no longer on the advisory board
of FAIR/EXTRA!
        Why? You might ask. Well I'll tell you. Mostly because Fairness
& Accuracy In Media people don't believe in Ouija boards or seances. But I
can assure you, Edward Asner, Jackson Browne, Noam Chomski, Casey Kasem,
Winona LaDuke, Prime Anarchist, Tim Robbins, Dr. Been Jammin' Spock, Studs
Terkel, and Little Steven Van Zandt still are.

PAWN- (Oneida, WI) - Journal Poem 5 got published in the spring '97 
Sheeps Head Review, a twice-a-year art and poetry magazine on the University
of Wisconsin campus. See also ATI 74 for JP-5. 
        "Didn't make me any money," said local poet Marc Frucht, "so you
can't really call me a pundit yet. But it was a whole lot of fun. So call
me a fundit."

LADIES AND GENDERMEN, WE NOW RETURN TO PART 7 OF mARC wEISENhEIMER'S 
GUIDE TO THE UNABOMBER'S MANIFESTO.
151. The social disruption that we see today is certainly not the result
of mere chance. It can only be a result of the conditions of life that the
system imposes on people...If the system succeeds in imposing sufficient
control over human behavior to assure its own survival, a new watershed n
human history will have been passed... in the future, social systems will
not be adjusted to suit the needs of human beings. Instead, the human being
will be adjusted to suit the needs of the system.
162. The system is currently engaged in a desperate struggle to overcome
certain problems that threaten its survival, among which the problems of
human behavior are the most important. If the system succeeds in acquiring
sufficient control over human behavior quick enough, it will probably
survive. Otherwise it will break down. We think the issue will likely be
resolved within the next several decades.
