           ATI MISSION STATEMENT
                    by Prime Anarchist.

There is only 1 acceptable purpose for technology:

Simply?

To improve life.

Lives of people, plants animals; people in jail, people in the air,
people in the water.

Winged and legged. "Things" that just set there. Every single atom
on Mother Earth is sacred. If any technology works against one single
thing's harmony with another:

YOU'RE USING IT WRONG.

"Make your adjustments and get back to me."

<> NITED NATIONS - TripleE - MINTON LOOKING FOR ONE GOOD LONGFELLOW.
        Lawrence Serengetti becomes the 37th poet to turn down the 
President's invitation to come read Chelsea to sleep this summer.
        With sex charges looming all over the white house lawn this year
some suggest pundits the world over have sworn a secret pact to stay
a ten-foot pole's length away or more from the presidential first  
daughter at all times.
        But Serengetti says it has nothing to do with that.
        "Each poet has a different reason, I'm sure," says Serengetti.
"Some say they won't sell out, others refuse to give their social security
number." Serengetti also said many don't wish to risk a photo op with 
the man whose opinion polls go up and down faster than the beat of "that
bad 1070's porn-movie-theme-music."
        "Me, I just think President Minton's a bad dresser," said 
Serengetti. "I mean, his pants don't match, sometimes he only shaves half
his face, and his speeches don't rhyme."


                CONTROLS LACKING ON LOCAL SALES OF US WEAPONS.
                Some Firearms May Be Finding Their Way To Maple Ave.
                and Washington St., Maybe Even 23rd.
         By Edmond Dahmer. 
         New Holland Rhymes Service.
         NITED STATES - Despite US laws intended to curb local trafficking
         in firearms, the Minton administration has discovered that 
         Niketon has virtually no control over where American weapons
         end up once they are shipped to Europe, officials say.
                As a result, Tipper Over says thousands of high-powered
         and semi-automatic American pistols and rifles sold to Europe
         in the last few years have ended up fueling violent conflicts
         in places that include McDonalds, the Post Office, and now a 
         few state lotteries.
                There are also indications that American firearms have
         found their way to Kidney Island and the Joneboro, Arkansas
         public school system.
                As a first step to address the problem, the state 
         Departpersont has called an emergency meeting for January 19, 2002.
                When asked why the emergency summit was pulled together
         so rapidly, State Departpersont Nancy "Stun" RayGun said they
         needed to meet well before the fiscal change and also the tax
         deadline or else the illegal distributors might make an 
         offering of common stock on Tall Street.
                Minton administration officials, who are making a major
         effort to stem the illicit movement of firearms, say they 
         discovered the loophole somewhere between GATT and NAFTA. The
         Embarrassy says they won't divulge exactly where but assured
         the American public they will have this fixed by 2076.

And in real news, one year from today, 1/3 of Canada will finally be ruled
by the indigenous people who live there. Some people call them Inuits,
some call them Eskimos, but the indigenous people in charge there, making
up 85% of the 26,000 people who live there say, "Rules. We will have
Nunavat.
   (a prime anarchist comment. That's beautiful. Especially since in 1992
    the Canadian government announced this will come about "immediately."
    Those Kanuks are almost as boggledy bogged as we are!!!")


mighty hinge: great place for a prime anarchist opinion column, wouldntcha
think?
        I watched 3 minutes of Roller Derby on CLASSIC SPORTS NETWORK (tm)
yesterday while I waited for my oatmeal to boil. Whatever happened to
Roller Derby? That was some weirdass schitt. Looked like an excuse for
men and women with feathered hair and bad makeup jobs to beat each other 
up wearing expensive bad disco clothing. Round and round they go, 
up and down, up and down. Almost reminds you of bad 70's porn, eh? 
(OK, Bill Hicks you get two posthumous checks for $7.)

subject: Ever wanted to be a hacker?

Have you ever wondered how people called hackers keep on annoying 
government agencies and major corporations? Most secure government
information is not a secret to these people, no protection guarantees
safety against their breaking in. Some people may think that in order to
be a hacker one most be extraordinarily smart, use expensive equipment
and have contacts with the underground world. This is not true.
        Recent studies show that a computer user is at least twenty
percent smarter than an average person. If you are reading this you
are smart enough. (too close? t.i.c.) All the equipment you need is your
computer and a modem. And try to avoid contacts with the underground 
world - they are trouble. All you really need is information. For the

    Password shadowing.
    Dialouts.
    Scanners.
    Brute force hacking.
    ...and much more.

  (3rd ed note: ay yay yay. If you really need this phile that badly,
   do a keyword search in your favorite engine. I considered shelving
   this letter in its entirety, but thought some of the content was worth
   sharing. Believe me, I feel really rotten about editing the addy out;
   because I'm mega-against censorship, but it was the only way I would
   print the whole thing, and if I shelved it, you can be assured, it would
   have been the first time in ATI history something in our email box 
   didn't get printed for reasons besides our own "disheveledness."
   Again, sorry for address-white-out and the huge editorial intrusions.
   Will be kept to the minimum in the future if possible.)

PARODEES, PAIR OF D'S PARODIES. Prime Anarchist Parodic Odes.

This one's to O Solo Mio by Eonardo Di Caprio 

Oh Solo mio, O solo mio.
Oh solo mio, o solo mio.
I don't,     know the rest.
So it is best, to just sing what I know. Oh.
O solo,      mio.


This is to We'd Like To Thank You Herbert Hoover, from the Broadway
Play "ANNIE." 
We'd like to thank you Billary Clinton,
For really showing us the way,
We'd like to thank you Billary Clinton,
You made us what we are to-day!

Prosperity was round the corner, 
A cozy cottage built for two,
In this blue heaven that you gave us
Yes! we're turning blue.




Parody. To the Tune of: the Hymn Once to Every Man and Nation.
Once the myth becomes a nightmare
Wherein church abuses lie
Some ordained become false prophets
Blinded to the real most high.
Some will say you work within it.
Others cry out "topple down."
Babylon will fall unaided
Safety has no golden crown.

When your leaders all disgrace you
Time will come the youth shall lead
Truth prevails slow but surely
Turning you away from greed.
Piecing back the myth together
Look to what your elders taught
Peace can't come when love's perverted
Victory's only in battle not fought.




Here's another. To the tune of House of the Rising Sun.
The "D" version, not the "Am" one. But that'll work fine too it
turns out.
There is a house on Main Street USA
They call the factory.
It's been the ruin of my whole generation;
But me, Oh God, not me.

Bought me a John Deere tractoree
That ran me 7 years rent.
They took it back so violentlee
Long before the money'd been spent.

(ch)

All the jobs I knew went to Mexico
When the US Empire collapsed.
& none were the wiser 'cause the wars got small
When the great experiment elapsed.

(ch)

So listen to my sad sad tale,
& tell your children cold.
Be sure to ignore your parents advice.
Dontcha learn anything until you get old.




Is there time for one more?
Loosely to MORE THAN A FEELING by Boston.

Don't know the words to the rest of this song
So I reach for my fake book and sing along.
I ask myself is this the right way
I close my eyes and forget where I was.

(ch) More than a chord change.
Just one note that I can't sing.
Must be a key change.
Had the right words and everything.

Haven't a clue where it goes from here.
So I wander around making perfectly clear.
This version is no more than parody.
I hum a few bars in the E minor key.

(ch) repeat and fade.
