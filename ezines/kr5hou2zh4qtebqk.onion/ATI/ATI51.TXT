     Hello. Welcome to ATI51.  First off, I apologize for all the typos
in ATI49 and ATI50. We'll try to better this time ;) .
     I would like to welcome all of the new ATI readers that have been 
added to our net distribution list.  We acquired these new readers due to
a piece written by Prime and myself that was run in the Computer Underground
Digest (CuD).  Any reader who has any comments or contributions, or would
just like to say hi, email me at:
...uunet!tronsbox!akcs.groundzero
     Those of you who expressed an interest in writing for ATI may send in
their contributions by typing them out and emailing me the text at the 
above address.  Anyone who does not have a net address may type out their
piece in hardcopy (handwrite it if you have to as long as it's readable)
and send it to me at the above ATI's PO Box address. Submissions can range
in size from one paragraph to about 15k. We will consider articles larger
than 15k, but send a brief outline first before submitting the actual piece.
     A warm welcome also goes out to two new regular contributors: Happy
Harry Hardon (anyone see "Pump Up The Volume"?) and Stormbringer.  You'll
be seeing items from them every so often.
     Also, some corrections and updates on items in ATI49/50. Ripco BBS is
back up, under a much smaller system with a file area and one message base. 
The sysop, Dr. Ripco, has stated that the "new Ripco" is not meant to replace
the system as it was before Sun Devil, but exists mainly as a means for
interested parties to keep in touch. Call it at 312-528-5020.
     In our review of other interesting publications, we neglected to 
mention CuD (although we have written it up in a previous issue). It is an
online newsletter dedicated to reporting items about the computer underground
and any issues relevant to computer use, first ammendment rights of computer
users, and more. CuD is a professional journal and provides valuable 
information in a well-written, concise format.  To get on their distribution
list, email them at: tk0jut2@NIU.BITNET.
     Now, as always, let's start out with Prime Anarchist and his column,
Prime Anarchist World News:
 
pawnPAWNpawnPAWNpawnPAWNpawnPAWNpawnPAWNpawnPAWNpawnPAWNpawnPAWNpawnPAWNpawn
 
    Allo, Luke. Laura et al? Prime Anarchist here. Your Libertarian at
Large. Or was that Librarian on the Luge? Or was that Thespian on the
Thames???
    INSURED UP TO 100,000.? Yeah, right!!! Remember the old-time bike with
the huge thin front wheel, and the little wimpy wheel in the back? Know what
it's called? Penny Farthing Bicycle. This trivial thought, petty poop, and
little luckypiece brought to you by P A P.
    Sign on a park bench, "NO GOVERNMENT WILL BRING YOU FREEDOM," Yippie!!!
I recommend Earl Grey tea over Celestial Seasons or English Breakfast-then
again, nothing beats a good (FLASH-- this just in. Prime Anarchist changes
his tea-stance. "I get a bigger kick out of English Breakfast now. Anyone
who can make something in Pencil-Vein-Yah, and call themselves English has
my vote!!! Had me rolling on the floor with laughter. Eating white bread
is like chawing on a soft sugary sponge.
    The DIAMOND VISA CARD. A 50,000 limit. Lets you buy stocks and bonds.
No commission-- just a 29$ service charge with each transaction. Hmm. What
made the 29-crash??? Fronted bucks!! Hmmm...
    If anyone wantsa do a movie about George Bush, John-Boy Walton would
make about a great choice to play our illustry yuss Prez-Phez. When
restringing a guitar, always wear something around your arms. Nasty slices
are no fun.
    Dr. Hunter S. Thompson freed, film at 11-ish.
    TomTom Club is getting back together. At long last, some old-timers
re-onioning I can tolerate.
    #'s? You want #'s? I don' nee' y'ur stinkink #'s. If you're still with
us here, here's a treat: 213 935 1111's a loopchecker generator. Some
gweebs call em sweep or sweeptone. So is 215 698 0049. Also 617 494 9900 
and 718 528 9979. 412 633 3333 is a PA Bell employee newzlyne. So iz
717 255 5555. 619 375 1234'll getcha time and temp on the west coast; while
303 443 1910 gets u the same schtuff for the rockies. Anyone got central
and atlantic? Lemme know. The Watson vmb demo has changed from an 800# to
508 650 1399. I guess like our beloved fearless-faithless healer, Pat
Robertson after a prezident-yall ploy, THEY can't afford to foot the
fonebill anymore EITHER. 719-630-1111 is a lot of fun. News, sports, jokes,
poems, stories, movie reviews, all automated, menu driven. AT&F is
800 424 5057. Tell em u wanna traid dope for tobacco, acid for alcohol,
and daisies for dummdum bullets. 800 826 6290 is the automated fone-service
changer-upper. The white house press office is 1-800 424 9090.  Have
much phun, ok?
    RESEARCH TOPIC OF THE DECADE: Why does ITT get to share the 1-800 424
exchange?? Thank you Sothsenes Behn, thank you Adolf Hitler!!!
    Book of the day? "How Not to Pay Your Bill Collectors" by D. Trump.
$15.95. Tell him you'd rather owe it to him than cheat him out of it. Send
him a check for 13 cents. He'll cash it in less than a week.
I swear to God.
    PRIME'S FAMOUS NEW FOLK SONG CHORUS:Abm,E,Gb,Abm. George, George, George
of the jungle. How ya gonna deal with the drugz u dealt. George, george,
good king george. What's gonna happen under martial law.
    FLASH, FLASH, FLASH. (hey, cut it out. that hurts your eyes) World Will
End; And You May Die.  James Baker (not the jailed preacherman-prophet-
pudpuller-pee, but might as well be (the sik of state)), in a sudden
turn of back on national tv, told both sides of the gaza strip (dont ask
for an 8 oz gaza strip (medium-well) at a kosher restaurant.) "our fone #
is still 1-202-456-1414. If you feel like talking about peace sometime,
give us a call." Now, I'm not saying we should continue our orgiatic
lovemaking with either side but we've been in bed with Israel for 42 years
now, and mother earth has stayed-together-at-her-seams so far DESPITE all
our efforts to plunder, pillage and petrify. You know what the Bible says
about cursing Israel? Uh oh...
    Welp, that's about it for now. Tune in next week when Prime interviews
a friend of a friend of a real beatnik. We'll have more phun #'s, and we'll
bring you "all the viewz that fits in a bag lady's shopping cart". Hasta
Banana..Buenos Tacos.............
