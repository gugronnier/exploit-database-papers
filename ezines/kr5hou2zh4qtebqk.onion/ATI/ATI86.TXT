Prime here, how goes it? No letters to the editor this week. A first in a 
while. Summer's getting things moving slowly I guess. Not much netsurfing,
maybe there's some real surfing going on, eh?
OK how it is with Leopold, Mr. Aldo dude? He was born in Burlington, Iowa
which has no particular attention to hold me to; but he got his master of
Forestry degree in Yale, and being the konnetiuk that I am, my ears pricked
up when I heard that. Never mind my first thought of how the hell does one
practice forestry in Connecticut??? Then come to find out he taught at
University of Wisconsin from 1933 until the day he did the physical death
thing. Earth Firsters quote him a lot, so my ears had to prick up a LOT last
week.

So, what else do you wanna know about Aldo? Knock it off, Jolie. I heard
that. She thinks you wanna know "nothing." OK. I'll tell you anyhow.
   Read the phollowing books immmmmmmmmmmediately if you wanna be IN THE
KNOW as regards this wonderful planet, old space ship earth of ours.

   "Game Management," "Sand County Almanack," and especially "Round River."

OK. I promised stuff about the hotel-from-hell.
HOLIDAY INN ALERT!!! HOLIDAY INN ALERT!!! HOLIDAY INN ALERT!!!
1986. HI enters into a direct partnership with the Chinese government.
Jello Biafra, eat your chingadoodoo heart out.
Holiday Inn now represents 75% of all foreign money coming into Tibet.
Do I have to explain how repressive China is of Tibetan people? I hope not.
Lemme know if I need to, I'd please to oblige.
Can you say blowing up monasteries???
All fones and phaxes are tapped coming and going to/from Holiday Inn.
Police have keys to all the rooms for regular random searches. (oxymoron???)
During tense times Holiday Inn there has billeted Chinese troops and 
security forces used the hotel as a nerve center to monitor the actions of 
tourists. That suxxx.  
You might call 18006210555 and 8004654329 if you feel like telling them
how you feel. I feel kinda randy.

JOURNAL POEM 15 by Prime Anarchist aka Marco Capelli

Hill climb.
      up a hill;
     up a hill;
    up a hill;
   up a hill;
  up a hill;
 up a hill;
Up a hill.
You can't find good clam 
Chowder up a hill.
Great cod, but lousy chowder.
2 stroke oil: that'd get you
Up a hill. Or take a cog.

There's 575 lefts in 3/4 of a mile.
Are there any fossils of people
Up a hill? Or just fish?
Blisters: Don't shoogoo (tm) sneakers
If you'll be climbing up a hill.
Red zinger iced tea.
Throw these shoes to the rats.
Sunset from a foothill.
Setting behind the hill.

Chapstick will be 
Crucial up a hill.
Calves hurt: heels too.
Blister the size of Boulder.

NORAD's storming pretty
Hard down there.
Barr Camp -- 4 bucks a night
In an A-frame,
Half way up her purple
Mountain's majesty.

I'm so high it's 
Raining sideways.
Up a hill.
2 miles.
Barefoot.
Both ways.
