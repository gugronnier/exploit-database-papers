CAVENHAM, UK - Madeline Albright asked Prime Anarchist to accompany
her to Saturday's funeral of Princess Diana but he humbly declined.
   "It wasn't my idea," said Albright, "but how could I not consider it."
She said the Queen had told her to invite Anarchist Monday.
Thurston Gates, spokesman for her majesty said the Queen considered him the
closest thing to a Thomas Jeffereson experience the United States has had 
in YEARS. (emPHASis on the YEARS)
   "Naturally," said Gates, "Her Majesty would want Anarchist present. He
went on to say it was with regret that she accepted Anarchist's offer to
have Lord Hanson go in his stead.
   Hanson will escort Albright and will be carrying a rolled up letter to 
her Majesty which he's been instructed to un-roll at the very moment her
Queenliness will be standing over her daughter's coffin.
   "I'm sorry," will begin Anarchist's short scroll, "Sorry about the trees,
uranium and coal -- and Irishmen uprooted all these years, and doubly sorry
your Majesty, for the trees, gold and plutonium -- and Navajo dead. It's all
my fault.                          
For Lord Hanson,

Prime Anarchist"
Anarchist could not be reached for comment this morning.
A local BBS sysop was willing to confirm the invitation,
although software still tends to be disallowable in court.
A firewatch clerk at Three Mile Island broke loose from her solitaire
game on her Pentium Hewlett Packard just long enough to say,
"Yeah, I heard that too, here lemme do a Savvy Search and show you."
She wasn't able to call the confirmation up via Savvy.com
but Dogpile and Yahoo worked just fine.
Paparazzi are now in the process of getting an actual photo of
Prime Anarchist's parchment letter from Albright's office.
Anarchist will be signing his reply at 4pm this evening using 23 pens,
despite Nancy Reagan's Insistence that it transpire at 432 pm.
To use the 23 pens necessary for all his friends he will be signing
his middle name for the first time in 39 years.

	    Good Evening, and welcome to the 93rd issue of ATI.
	    Activist Treasonings Incredible. September 5, 1997.

To The Editor:
cool site.  very non-linear.      

And Another Letter to the Editor: (a great week)

This is cool. Last time I read ati was around '91 or so, and I wanted to get
involved with it. Do you take submissions etc? 
    (ediface note:  yes! yes! hit your send key now...)
					       Certain lines have stuck with
me over the years, like how numbers with answering machines were good for
playing your guitar over, etc. My time since then has been spent on cyberian
art i guess you'd call it, on making music and literature in the digital
world on my linux box. ATI was one of the few zines that seemed to be in the
same direction i was, mixing computer hacking & modern tech knowledge with
pure art, true writing & indie rock etc. So are you guys publishing again?
This is great news!

<Sheesh!>

Thoughts On Diana:

Where does the public spotlight end and privacy begin?
Here in the US people very much value their privacy.
Celeberties don't seem to have that option.
Seriously, I'm surprised laws weren't passed long ago to stop the blood
thirsty tactics of some of these paparazzi freelance photographers.
Instead of helping Princess Diana out of her car the bastards were
snapping pictures as she bled internally and slowly died!
According to CNN, one picture was published ALREADY in the pages of
a german magazine. And the celebs can't do much.
If a celeb were to hit one of these people, they get slapped with
an instant lawsuit. God Bless America! Easy money! And legal too!
Personally if someone were shoving a camera lens in my face they'd
end up with at least a broken camera. Someone hand me an AK-47, please?


Thoughts On Clinton and Government.....

This is a man that needs to be seriously booted out of office.
If you think about it, a lot of these politicians in their 3 piece
business suits and fancy cars have no clue what America is about.
All they give a shit about is how much money they can stuff in their
pockets and bank accounts. Ever see Clinton wearing jeans and a 
teeshirt like an average Joe? No? Neither did I....
Think Clinton or Billary would be caught dead walking through the
streets of Newark alone at night? Fuck no! <I've done it, it's not so
bad.> We need people in office who have a clue what Americans want.
We need people in office who understand America and her needs.
Get rid of the "Old Boy's Network" and bring in fresh new young people.
<GZ For President!> <-- THAT would shake this country up...heheheh....
When was the last time someone in power asked you what YOU wanted?
Think about it.....

What's the opposite of PROGRESS? CONGRESS of course!

And now....a song based on something I heard in a bar.....

To the tune of: Under The Boardwalk.....

When the sun goes down and the muggers are on the loose....
And you fear for your life and feel your neck is stuck inside a noose...
Down in the subway, under the street, yeah...
There are motherfuckers down there, you don't wanna meet....
Down in the subway, where police fear to tread....
Down in the subway, where you might end up dead....
Down in the subway, where for your life you may flee...
Down in the subway, where cops beat you for free.....
Down in the subway, subway.....

As the darkness comes, and the city turns into hell....
As I descend the stairs, I almost gag because of the smell....
Down in the subway, under the street yeah.....
There are motherfuckers down there, you don't wanna meet.....
Down in the subway... <Hey buddy! Can ya spare a quarter?>
Down in the subway... <Gotta support my daughter...>
Down in the subway....<Can ya spare a dime?>
Down in the subway....<Aye, you got the time?>
Down in the subway, subway.....

As the time flies by, I just missed my friggin train....
I must be looney to be here, I must have water upon the brain....
Down in the subway, under the street yeah.....
There are motherfuckers down there, you don't wanna meet.....
Down in the subway....when the hour is late....
Down in the subway....I got a loaded .38...
Down in the subway....If it's after 11....
Down in the subway....I got an AK-47...
Down in the subway, subway.....

So much for that.....

Until they let me out of my nice padded room and near a computer
again.....

That's it. It's that simple. You put it there, we'll print it here.

Mother Teresa is dead.

It wouldn't be so unusual for such an elderly woman with so many health
problems, living such a stressful life, to die, but the fact that she died
just hours before her friend and helper, Princess Diana, was herself put
into a grave, makes this sad event much worse than it already is.

When Diana died, a bright light in this ever-darker world was extinguished.
With Mother Teresa joining her, the darkness is even deeper.

Princess Diana is dead. Mother Teresa is dead. But fascist tyrants like
George Bush and Ronald Reagan live on and on, seemingly protected by the
same evil forces which assisted them in rising to power in a country not so
long ago hailed as "The Land of the Free and the Home of the Brave".

Billy Blythe, a/k/a Bill Clinton, a lifetime CIA agent masquerading as
America's "president", appeared on TV smiling, struggling to hold back
laughter, as he gleefully announced the death of Princess Diana.

Prince Charles, who had cast aside his beautiful wife, (a woman nearly
every man on earth dreamed of), for a grouchy sea hag with a pock-marked
face - who was already married - showed his "grief" by dilly-dallying
around in green kilts and bright red socks at his holiday resort.

Elizabeth Saxcoven von Goethe, a/k/a Queen Elizabeth I of Windsor, a/k/a
The Mean Queen, showed her grief by ignoring the many millions of her
subjects who were weeping at the gates of Kensington Palace - mourning the
loss of the woman who they WANTED to be their queen: Diana Frances Spencer.
It wasn't until after newspapers all over the world had brought unparralled
shame to the Mean Queen that she finally decided to reluctantly make a TV
appearance to try to convince her outraged subjects that she shared their
grief. Sure. Sure she did. That's why she ORDERED Diana and Charles to
divorce. That's why she violated Diana's court-ordered child custody
rights. That's why she refuses to lower the flag to half-mast. That's why
she refuses to give Diana the respect of a state funeral even though there
are expected to be anywhere from 10 to 20 million mourners lining the
funeral route tomorrow.

The Mean Queen hated Diana for many reasons. One of the reasons that most
people don't know is because she was jealous not only of her great beauty,
charm and popularity, but her blood line. You see, the Mean Queen is a
German. Germans have occupied the British throne for quite some time.
Germany's Kaiser Wilhelm II was the nephew of England's Queen Victoria. The
fact of the matter is: Diana had more royal British blood than the Mean
Queen. In fact, Diana is the first true British woman to marry a British
prince in over 300 years. Before Diana, brides were imported from foreign
countries to occupy the British throne.

I am not alone in considering Diana's death a well-planned assassination.
After her coffin is laid in the ground and the tears dry, there will surely
be many private investigations conducted and many books written with
barrels of evidence supporting this allegation.

As for Mother Teresa, I am sure that upon hearing of Diana's trafic death,
she died of a broken heart.

God damn the queen!

Truthfully,

This is my third week in a row posting this, I hope you don't mind. If you
do, please just scroll down to the other stuff. This friend's letter means
the world to me and I wish to help out any way I can.

	 5 years after the quincentennial:
	 It's Time to:
	       MAKE OCTOBER 12TH
	    INDIGENOUS PEOPLES DAY,

      Free Leonard Peltier,
       Stop Forced Relocation at Big Mountain,
       and Build a Movement for Justice
	 and Human Rights for All!

       Five years ago, in 1992, hundreds of thousands, if not millions
of people throughout the Americas spoke out and acted in opposition
to the government sponsored celebrations of Christopher Columbus and in
support of the rights of indigenous peoples.
	However today, in 1997, AIM activist Leonard Peltier sits in 
prison during this 21st year of incarceration for an act the government knows
he did not commit. It has been revealed that the FBI withheld from his
trial evidence that proves his innocence.
	In northeast Arizona, in the Black Mesa area, 3,000 indigenous
people are fighting forced relocation from their land because Peabody
Western Coal Company wants it to make profits.
	And there are numerous other examples of both continuing repression
and continuing resistance by indigenous peoples against violations of
their rights.
	Join with people around the country who will be fasting from Oct 1 
through 12, fasting for part of that time, organizing local demonstrations
and actions, or acting in other ways in solidarity with Leonard Peltier,
the Big Mountain resisters, other struggling Native American peoples and
for the human rights of all.
	We will never be free in this country until we face up to the
historic record, set it straight and get it right. "Getting it right" means
honoring, upholding and joining in solidarity with those who have much
to teach us about living in harmony with the natural world, about working
cooperatively for the good of all, and about steadfastness in struggle
despite the most difficult conditions. We urge you to join us this October.
