To the Tune of "Were You There."

Were you there when they diverted those funds.
Were you there when they diverted those funds.
Oh, sometimes it maketh me angry, so angry.
Were you there when they diverted those funds.


Were you there when they gave the contras arms.
   "   "       "         "
Oh, sometimes it maketh me angry, so angry.
Were you there...


Were you there when they gave Iraq those planes
   "   "     "   "
Oh, sometimes it maketh me angry, so damned angry.
Were you there...


Were you there when they sold all of those drugs,
Were you there while they distribute those drugs,
Oh, sometimes it makes me angry, so angry.
Were you there...


Were you there when they charged it to the poor.
Were you there when they bilked it on the poor.
Oh, oh, sometimes it makes me angry. So ANGRY;
Were you there when they charged it to the poor.

Hi, Prime Anarchist here. I don't have much to say today
so I'll keep this short. I got up late, and then decided
to put ATI in the composing room this morning instead of
tonite. So you all get a slightly early treat.
And MUCH BETTER THAN KIBBLES AND BITS.
Speaking of which, did you know they came out with a
gentle high-fiber version of Kibbles that's geared for
older dogs and getting them the consistancy they need in
their doggy lifestyle? Kibbles and Schi*t*z.
Well, we'll get quickly on to the #'s run and then some
interviews and stuff. There were no contributions to the 
ati@etext.org box so most of this issue will be my own
fault. I haven't been near the marco99@juno.com box in a
couple weeks so there might be a backup of submissions
there if anyone's responding to old ATI's. (and I can't 
imagine how many letters are being deadlettered or bounced
from the BRO box or the New Jersey Addresses. Any way of
finding out, Ground Zero? OK here goes the #'s runs. Hope
you all had good Holy Dayz. Happy New Years too. Hope you
made good new years revolutions. Mine is to change things.

#'s run for sunday, dec 27, 1997. 10:38 hours...

EXERCISE AND REFLECTION:
     from the 1993 book "Holy Fools and Mad Hatters."
How To Be Your Own Court Jester
        The next time you feel caught up in some problem
which has you upset or worried, call in the clowns.
Exaggerate the issue as much as you can: "Oh, God, this
is the WORST thing that has EVER happened to me. It's 
worse than the San Francisco earthquake of '89!"
        Then you might pound your head in clown's jest,
weep fake tears, throw yourself on the floor... then have
a good laugh. Be both audience and clown. When you're done
you may not only feel better, but the issue or problem may
find its proper proportion in your life.

        I wonder how much an American (or any for that matter)
running shoe would REALLY be if companies weren't allowed to 
find $6 a day labor somewhere outside their own country?
        Let's see. When a brand new pair of Nikes comes out
they're about $109.99 and they're handmade in the US of A.
        Then about 6 months later they're made in Korea by hand
and in the US on a machine and they're about 89.99. $70 and $40
seems to be the magic #'s at ALL the shops by the time you can
walk into a store and start asking for help finding that model,
but an American made pair. I swear, ask a clerk to help you find
it, you might be able to find them this discovery for their own 
self-revolution at the same exact moment!
The shoes are all mixed in by now. Korean handmades, Thai machines,
"Made by real live Tianamin College students," 
        "Handmade in the USA" 
        "made by scabs," all of them. Same "who cares-price" 
for each of them. USA, Korea, China, Guatemala, 
no one seems to care by then--
same "low" price! Of course when they get to Goodwill that $109 pair
sits right next to a $39.99 pair for $5. Ask if you can have them both
for $6 see where THAT gets ya.
        So I'd say "middle class" America is unwittingly working 
with slaves hand-in-hand to bring us these so-self-subsidized 
sneakers. (AND NIKE'S NOT THE ONLY ONES BY THE WAY - ASK ME WHEN THE
LAST PAIR OF SANFRANCISCO LEVIS i EVER BOUGHT WAS??? They're just
scapegoat of the year, I'd say.)
        Yeah, we're keeping Nikes from being $300 a pair, on Kate
Moss' feet, 209.49 on ours and staying out of Goodwill's bins for about 
3 extra weeks.
        So how much is a pair of sneakers really if we remove slave
labor from the picture? Who the heck knows. Do the math however you
want. I figure it's about 80:30 and/or 240:90 but this economy's just
so darn complexified now I've got half a mind to stop doing math
altogether and just plain call it FALSE. 
                (did he say "false?"
                Anarchist said "false economy?"
                Prime Anarchist said a "false..."
        I would never... well...
