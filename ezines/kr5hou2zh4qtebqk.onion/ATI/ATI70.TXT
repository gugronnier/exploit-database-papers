getting this e-paper out? 
   Well, 2 things mainly. 5 days ago I found this little laptop in the 
   donation pile and I've been bebopping around on it most of my waking 
   hours ever since. That was one thing. Oh, the other,midterms midterms

   spring break, so anyone near there please send any bikini reports to:

Thank you Prime Anarchist for hitting our HOME PAGE. You will find some 
interesting things out about the market of cochineal in the Canary Islands. 
There are about 200 Has of plantations of cactus in Lanzarote, but today 
the farmers are working in only 60 Has. It means that the crop can reach up 
to 12.000 kgrs p.a. Although it doesn't rain very much over our islands, 
this year 1996 it was raining a lot, and all the cactus of the island were
ready to be infested with the insects during this summer. It means that it 
will be possible to export around 12 TONS of dried cochineal per annum, are 
you ready to buy???
We will keep sending you new information about our production. Please order 
often and order a lot.
     Due to the big quantity of messages that we have received
   If you are interested to buy from us, we have prepared small consingments 
   of 50 and 100 grs of "dried cochineal" that you will receive by mail.
   (ed. note: can you send me some bugz-free snapple???)

Marc-0,
Wow man. I mean like, I just finished Bukowski and here's your shit. 
Bukowski's got nothing on you man like, I mean all he talks about is 
fucking and you'll talk about ANYthing.
Good stuff, Marc. (grin)

THE DAY CHRIS ELIOT TOLD ME TO GO FUCK MYSELF
		  by marc weisenheimer
I was sitting at IHOP in Groton, Connecticut with my friends George and 
Deanna (names have been changed to protect the guilty) it was about 
2:45 a.m. 
   5 or 6 booths away this guy who we were certain looked exactly like 
   Chris Eliot was sipping a mug from 2 caraffes of coffee and
   "I'm not gonna ask him, you ask him," George told me.
   "Nuh, uh." I declined. "You do it."
   "I'll go do it," Deanna said obviously more "ballsed" than either of us. 
   She came back with his autograph on a napkin and whispered to both of us 
   leaning over the table toward each other,
   "he said if we don't make a big scene he'll sign his name. Look. It 
   IS him."
   So naturally, I stood right up, looked him square in the eye and said 
   with a big huge toothy smile, crowns and fractured cuspids and 
   everything, "Hey Chris Eliot. It's 3am in Groton Connecticut in an 
   International House of Pancakes. Get a Life!!!"
   "Fuck You!" he shouted getting up slapping a 20 down on the table and 
   leaving out the door before his tuna melt even got there. 
   That was the day Chris Eliot told me to go fuck myself. So put
   that in your brush-with-greatness-pipe and smoke it, mr. david letter-
   number-and-expletives-man.



STOP INJUSTICE 
    STOP
THE BOYS IN
    BLUE
       by Stv and the Crew

	Nothing better to do with their time? 
	Power freaks that mourn for youth to bust, for silly things like 
skateboarding, creating lies about you and your friends. You tell me, do 
they really mean:
TO PROTECT AND TO SERVE?
	In the 80's the saying was "SKATE OR DIE". Well, welcome to De Pere, 
Wisconsin, where instead of skate or die, it goes something like SKATE AND 
DIE. At least that is how the cops see it.
	Winter time, yes a break from sore legs, bruises, busted up bones, 
and torn skin. All these things are great to get away from for the season, 
but the greatest thing is four to five months without the 5-0 on your every 
move. Or so you think.
	Walking to work (in the snow) a cop, yes a cop pulls up, I fling my 
smoke, and exhale as quick as possible, no he did not see me smoking, or 
doing anything illegal, besides a little jay walking, when all of a sudden 
this cop is trying to tell me I am in some kind of "skate boarding gang."
	What in the hell is  a skateboarding gang? I skate for me. My 
friends skate for themselves. It's fun, it's a good waste of time and it is 
a good way to express yourself, it is NOT a gang. It is not some kind of 
religious cult, it is not my F U statement to the world. We skate alone, we 
skate together, it doesn't matter, it is all good clean fun. 
Stv Srubas

Just a note to the cops:
	You are adults, think that way, can't you see a difference between 
us and the gangsters? We stand for something, and it is not very easy to 
express your opinion when you're locked down by the 5-0, cut us the slack 
we deserve.
	We have the right to think for ourselves. If you strip us of 
everything we have, we still have our minds, our dignity, so it is 
worthless to keep taking what is mine because you will never get from me 
what you really want; so stop trying; fight the system. End the system.
Love:
Stv and the Crew  


JOURNAL POME 1
	by prime anarchist. previously published in a 33-poem book of 
poetry entitled "I Slurp My Coffee." (c)1995

Fireguard schmireguard, I'm in the 
Choir. Colorado 1st impression:
Kansas border from plane-- looks like a 
Rock; trees and houses stuck on it.
Ski's suitcases like huge
Musket carrying bags.
Sight landing in plane?
300 miles of beach sand.
Welcome to the semi-desert.

Dry mouth, nose bleeding off & on
For 16 hours. Short of breath
On a 1 flight staircase.
Sore muscles ail all morning. From walking??
Saltless water, oxygenless air; a
Bouyanciless jellyfish float in a lake.
Responseless foto-gray glasses just stay
Dark. Closer to the sun? Crisp papertowels
And toilet paper you can write on.

Coffee houses everywhere. One 4 each 7-11.
Aztec cooking all around. Empty rivers not
Flowing under bridges; called a wash.
Jasmin tea and onion bagel in 
Ice cream parlour; ice cream
And coffee in bagelteria. Lemon
Zinger tea in mason jar over ice.

"ROCKY MOUNTAIN HAIKU:
Or Sign On Wall":
DON'T DRINK AND ROCK CLIMB--
YOU WON'T BE ABLE TO HOLD
YOUR LIQUOR. GOOD DAY.
This has been ATI 70.
