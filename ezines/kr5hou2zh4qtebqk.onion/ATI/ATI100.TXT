                                               virtually lost issue 99 to cyberchance.
                                        "Figures," said Prime Anarchist, editor
                                     and publisher of ati since 1988, "the last
                               issue we lost was issue 9, we were sweating
                        it out during issues 19 and 29, how could we 
                   have even prepared for it?"
             He said it's really poetic that issue 99 would get "eaten" 
         by the Mac SE he's using for all his word processing needs.
     Cap 'N Crunch is probably out there saying, "I told you so," 
  ready to sell him a copy of his old EasyWriter (tm). Of course
Upon notifying Cliff Stoll of his problem, Anarchist had to endure
similar convo from the astronomer about how he ought to have snail-
mailed it rather than rely on all the latest and sub-latest technology.
Commercial/Hard/Soft/ShareWare expert Howard Mannic Panich said
Prime Anarchist should have seen it coming and run batch files to shut
down the computer the minute 2 or 3 K in a row had gotten corrupted.
   "Hell," said Panich, the New York partner of Panich, Mannic and
Clandenhoevel, "his whole black monday could have been averted if
he'd moved everything to pork bellies.

And now we reapeat the last part of  Sisyphus'
 continuing saga about continuing in cyberspace. 
(This was a tactical move hoping for wide distribution as
ATI 99 only made it to about 35 people.)

"A Day In a Life (One of Many) Of a Pot-Smoker"
(CON'T From Last Issue.) 
Call Stidfole. No answer. Call the other  number leave a futile message asking if I can
exhibit a bomb at the Hygienic. (OK so the pot got the best of me.) Can't think of
anyone else to call. Call information and get the number for the Keep. There's gotta
be a way to recoup these little bills I incur on the part of the Hygienic. That cost 75  cents.
Call The Keep. L e a v e  a    m e s s a g e   o n  t h e   a n s w e r i n g   m a c h i n e .
Gahhhhhh!!! No. NOT another cup of coffee. I'm coffee'd out now. 
    Look I gotta lotta calls out and I should really leave the line free for incoming calls.
I go get a drink of Kool-Aid. Fruit juice and sugar water, but it's soothing. While in the
kitchen I look outside. A miracle! I can see through the window. It's warm enough
outside to evaporate water! How nice on a late January day. I feel instant guilt that I'm 
not outside in it with the dog. The lawyer's cars half fill the backyard parking lot and
there are no squirrels, no dogs or cats or raccoons, moose, elephants, nor any other
critters around. (See? Works good, dont it? )  no people either. The sunlight is
rather harsh due to a high haze in the sky. There are a few fleecy cumulus around,
about scattered I'd say. The colors are all brown and gray, with a thin film of salt
washing even these colors almost into a black-and-white world. It's winter, that's
for sure. I pick up my book (Haggard's "King Solomon's Mines") and head 
back into the bed/computer/telephone room. There's no one I can call now. Time's
passing. I know Scott's typing away, but there's nothing I can do at this point.
Well, I'll read about Alan Quartermain as Macumazahn and Bougwhan (Good)
killing Scragga to stop him from massacree-ing some beautiful maiden in some
sort of put-up job by Twala the King and Gagool the evil witch-crone who'd 
lived forever. Haggard took 5 pages to describe the scene in the book but this
will have to do for us because Vinnie called. Ah! The time for Albert's poetry
reading is 7pm but Vinnie doesn't know if he's got dancers. He does know 
that there's supposed to be someone else who'd like to do a dance piece, but he's
rather vague about the fringes of that, too. At least I got one hard fact. Vinnie
says he'll call Bill, then Scott. I tell him I'll call Scott in the meantime. We hang 
up. I do so. I tell him the time for Abert's poetry reading and that he is to expect
a call from Vinnie and/or Bill with any further information they might have.
He's happy with that. I hang up and wait. Nothing happens so I go find
the roommate and tell him it's time to move. He's lying across the kitchen table -
spread quite like an omoeba absolutely zonked on pot. He sort of effervesces
with amoeba-like colors of chartreuse, whit-orange and pink with narrow
bands of blue forlining. It's pitiful. I scrape him into a glass jar, and 
abjure JACS quite strenuously that he is to STAY! Dog cringes. I tuck the
glass jar containing my roommate into a coat pocket and head out to the car.
When I got outside, my roommate came to life again, the car started on the
first try and it was almost spring for a mini-microsecond. But it's still winter
so we threaded our way through traffic to his old apartment.

Moscow, RUSSIA. Five anti-congressperson mines have
been set off by children playing recess, killing hundreds.

court," said Russian Prime Minister, Pol Pot. "Why didn't
I think of that??"

Rhinelander, WISC. Ron Carey Junior beat up Jimmy 
Hoffa III. During detention, Carey admitted trying to
force Hoffa to shoot his free throw from the circle 
with a chalk dollar-sign on it.
    "I'm not going near that thing," said Little Jimmy.
"I saw what happened to the last kid that did that. Blew
his head off. He lost his raisins, dates and walnuts."

We end this rebound issue with a poem, because Myth is the Shit.

JOURNAL POEM 29 from the book, "I Slurp My Coffee" by
            Marco Capelli

JOURNAL POEM 29 handling your every upper-management-level
dispute for more than 5 decades.

Eggrolls - like crispy cooked coleslaw pizzas.
1950's nunnery - like army boot camp for women.
"Earthquakes are allergic reactions to
Condominiums," says Robin Williams
On TV's Mork and Mindy show. Laughing,
I purchase "A Cultural Study of America,
1993," by Frank Lee at ArtRock Bookseller
in Denver. Was a blank book.

Cantata with midi music -
Like kareoke-4-Christ.
Movement of the mall?
Cooking canned cactus;
Comedians R 2 meta4ical  2day.

Where's rodeo clown college;
Or can I just show up?
Over haddock, coleslaw and coffee
In Hartford Hojos, I read
"EXTRA THICK SHAKE: Living In
Balance In An Over-Do-It Society,"
By Mark Weisenheimer.

I'm a gonna be sweatin' and jettin'
From this yabba dabba cuppa java.
Quakers still swim upstream musterin'
Good 'ol lonely only uncompromisingly
Opposition to war - every and each.

Will a bus transfer get me to 
Woodie Guthrie's or should I eat
Ben & Jerry's ice cream instead?

Fish-&-Chips'll be cod-&-fries:
Douse with vinegar 4 remembrance.
Cedar sage sweetgrass & tobacco.
"All milk and diapers should be 
Free for the taking," says
Vegan teetotaler from Atop
Pickup truck, NYC.

And Country 600 AM from Montreal plays
"Grampa," by the Judds on my shortwave.
Radio - like cabbage 4 rabbits.
