Nice looking page. 
I like the Warrior Poets the best. 
Your James Merrill page could use a little 
Sprucing though. Should I write you a poem? 



     Stones and Spice. And Bob.
     By LOUDON WAINWRIGHT 3d
    January 16, 1998 Reprinted from somewhere. I forgot
   who to credit. Maybe permission, maybe not...
KATONAH, N.Y. -- There's been a big pop music buzz in New York City 
this week. Probably it's left your head spinning with a mixture of 
nostalgia and befuddlement. Don't feel bad; I'm in the business, 
sort of, and I'm a little befuddled myself. 
   It began on Monday night at the Waldorf-Astoria, where Jelly 
Roll Morton, Allen Toussaint, Lloyd Price, Gene Vincent, Santana, 
the Eagles, Fleetwood Mac and the Mamas and the Papas were all 
inducted into the Rock-and-Roll Hall of Fame. This despite the fact 
that the actual hall -- that is, the building --
is in Cleveland. Here's a quick rock-and-roll trivia question: 
What was the name of Gene Vincent's backup band? If you said 
"The Blues Caps" you'd be right. And you'd probably be old. 

     On Wednesday some nice British young people blew into town. 
     The Spice Girls took a bus ride to Planet Hollywood to 
     promote their upcoming movie, "Spiceworld." 

My 16-year-old daughter, Lucy, does a lot of baby-sitting, and she 
tells me that this outfit's fan base consists mostly of second 
and third graders. And perhaps a few drooling dads, judging from the 
look of the band's provocative videos, shown over and over again 
on MTV. Anyway, on Wednesday the Girls donated some of their 
costumes to Planet Hollywood. Boy, Baby Spice's shoes right up 
there alongside the famous phone from "E.T." Pinch me, I'm dreaming. 

     The thing is, just when something like the Spice Girls has you 
ready to accept the fact that a new generation is elbowing us 
old-timers aside, you're confronted with the card of heavyweight 
granddads playing Madison Square Garden this week. 

     Those Brit-Pop perennials, the Rolling Stones, finish up a 
three-day residency in the main arena on Saturday. Also at the 
Garden, in the smaller venue that was once the mighty Felt Forum 
but now is insipidly referred to as "The Theater," Bob Dylan 
and Van Morrison start a five-day stint tonight. 

     Both acts sold out weeks ago. My friend George thinks I can 
use my great influence and high standing in the music business to 
get us a few tickets for Dylan-Morrison. He figures it should be 
easy, since back in 1969, at the start of my career, I was touted 
in the music press as "the new Bob Dylan." Of course, I was also 
referred to by one writer as "the male Melanie." 

     Oh dear; I seem to have stumbled onto the delicate subject of 
my career. With the possible exception of Jelly Roll Morton, the 
old Loudo has been around almost as long as all of the 
aforementioned stars and Hall of Fame inductees. And a week like 
this makes me ask myself, "Could I have been a contender?" 

     A little voice answers, "Hey, babe, you've performed before 
sold-out houses a few nights yourself." I'm thinking of a lovely 
little room over the river in Piermont, N.Y., called the 
Turning Point, capacity 83. Palookaville, like the Twilight Zone, 
is just a relative state of mind. 

     Speaking of states of mind, what are we to make of the most 
dominant musical event of the week, the New-Age Peloponnesian 
phenom Yanni? He has sold out 10 shows at Radio City Music Hall. 
Ed Micone, the executive producer at Radio City, has said he 
could have sold out 20. 

     Me, I think he -- Yanni, not Ed -- looks like the comedian 
Gallagher, only with better hair. Recently I listened to a few 
tracks from a Yanni CD and found the music to be rather soothing, 
with a piquant air of expectancy about it. After awhile I found 
myself mysteriously being lifted, as if I were -- well, in an
elevator. 

     So let's sum up This Week in Music. Dad and a bunch of 
8-year-olds are ogling the Spice Girls. Mom's checking out the 
modern-day Adonis. The new Bob Dylan can't get in to see the old 
Bob Dylan, the Mamas and the Papas are in the Hall and the 
grandpas are in the Garden. I think Gene and his Blue Caps
said it best: 
                          "Be-bop-a-lula."

A thought, brought to you by (PAWN):
Joe Klein, the political reporter who wrote
"PRIMARY COLORS" under the name "Anonymous." Hmmm.
Perchance... He wrote everything listed as anonymous 
from Shakespeare's time until now?

((PAWN) Clinton Meets With Carter)           
Friday, January 23, 1998; 7:13 p.m. EST 
WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton met Friday with
former President Carter for a report on Carter's recent trips to
Africa and China; and also to discuss expert scandal-handling. 
The White House declined to provide details of the meeting, and
Carter was unavailable for comment afterward. 
White House spokeswoman Rozz C. Arter said Carter's travels to
China did not mean that he is acting as an envoy for the president. 
"But they did discuss lusting. Common recurring theme these days."
Carter regularly briefs Clinton on his business trips. 
He met with the president last year to discuss Playboy, Penthouse
and Oui magazine.

PRIME SAYING MY FAVORITE THING TO RECEIVE IS POETRY. HINT, HINT...
....st, boys
for Allen Ginsberg
by TS (4/97)


          Blinded by fire, blinded by fire
          racing down the dirt road
          a stone's throw from the river
          2 boys naked as sin
          streaking down the dirt road


          Man in the corner shop sees them
          approach and he screams
          "Why you goin' so fa..."
          They don't hear him finish
          "...st, boys?!"
          They've jumped in the river
          down they go
          2 boys naked as sin.

We now end with the annual Prime Anarchist Packer Play by Plays.
Not brought to you by Frito Lays:
Later days, or Purple Haze.
This one brought to you by the letter A.   
(well, I was trying for an off-rhyme.
Get off my case, Diana...)

Michael J. Fox is doing just as much Lays no matter how
old he gets.
Less coke maybe?
Miller's trying to jerk some serious tears here,
and the game hasn't even started yet. Leave my sleeve
alone!
NBC movies -- let's give ourselves a free 1.3 million dollar 
minute.
Qualcommmm, Intellll, Sunamericaaaa, Layssss, these are
the cheaper seats...
Let's do lunch. Not. Hey, be glad it's not Pringles!
Doesn't look like Nike's buying ads this year. But they've got
their symbol i-konned all "over-the-haus."
Michael clocks a waitress. Somebody get that bright lights,
big pity loser off my screen!
Miller Lite again. Milwaukee heard from.
A true story. Yeah, I believe you.
"...fear is fear itself..." cut, "seguimos" to a JFK quote, cut; 
ORACLE. Ummm. I don't think so guys. Nice try though.
Doritos must've used some serious Real Audio to do that breathtaking
silence after the dynamic crescendos. Thank you Sony; we're not
worthy.
Olympics. I just KNEW Atlanta, GA couldn't keep it's tedturnermouth
shut.
Oh my God. 
Dios mio, ching... chingada, holy wha!
Is that the Beach Boys??? Go back to the Masonic Home & Hospitals
guys. Even Reagan and Edwin Meese thought you were yesterday's 
news way back when. Methinks the end of the world really IS near
at hand. This is like Star Wars 10 in 3-D!
Risk happens, life happens, bad guitar happens. 
The Hartford. ITT and Sun City a match made in Nafta-heaven. 
Elway V. Favre. Is that like Dole V. Clinton? Coke V. Pepsi?
NBC
NFL
same size -- equal prominence (sp?) ((hey, I'm quicker than AP/UPI!))
How much do I have to pay for equal prominence??? Cuanto cuesto???
Qualcom as Eva Peron. A revolution. Secret Deoderant, or the

Bill Clinton on behalf of the NFL corporation. What a yutz.

These are MY boys. Not because of an offensive defense,
or a formidable offense. No, why you might ask? 
I'll tell you. Their willingness to show up at Boys & Girls Clubs
East OR West on no notice whenever some kid was "down."
Real volunteerism that has NOTHING do do with United Way, the
International Money Fund, or the NEBF - (National Endowment for
the Bad Form)
SunAmerika for the Declaration of Independence. What's all this 
myth of government, myth of freedom bullcrap?
1800-westin-1
Westin hotels, who the westinghouse heck are they?
Pizza Hut.
Nafta, er uh, I mean Pepsico heard from. Gatzilla!!!
Intel corp with a blackhawk helicopter. Now that's a surprise. 
Right. A quick Sikorski, Connecticut moment before kickoff.
Wow!
I didn't know Jewel could sing. Go girl. Kate Smith's about to
be bested. I'm just filled with joy, halleluya, praise yahweh,
that country chick what's her name didn't do it. You know. the 
"blue" wannabe. Yeah, that's it Shania Twang.
Pepsi, Chrysler. Nothing to remember, nothing to note.
Nothing to write home a boat. (woops, wisconsin accent...)

    "I can run with my dog..." Wait. Nike DID buy an ad! No proof.
You just gotta believe me. I called that one before s/he ran up 
the stairs even. The fonts gave it away. Who else but Nike would 
be cheapskate enough to keep using a Commodore Amoeba???
Does Joe Gibbs strike a rezemble of HR Perot or what?
Hey -- what happened to all that blocked off robotic looking 3-D
machinazoid stuff for all the statistics? It's smooth now.
Must be Fire or Smoke. Did NBC go Mac? Maybe OS-8 is worth all the
bootup crashes afterall!
Yuck though. What's with all the Clarisworks Geocities-looking
stuff on the rushing and turnover charts??? Why not e-steal 
microsoft works for what it's good for. Almost as good as 
visicalc! Someone tell the NFL, NBC, NSA, IBM, FBI, IRS, IBM
to hire Ross H Parrot for their charts and graphs. He can do for
you what he did for 7 or 8 welfare states.    =)
Pepsi -- Generation Abuse-of-animals-next.
Generation Dead Duck.
If that ad were real life, that Canadian Goose would've blown up
over Marinette Wisconsin like an alkaseltzer seagull over Kidney
Island.
Budweiser bullfrog. What's up with all this animated blown up 
animals stuff???
Pontiac wide trac. Meep! Meep!
Cindy Crowfeet, now there's a fake animal they don't have the 
guts to blow up. Of course thanks to Dow Chemical all they'd need
is a footpump. But they need her at halftime I'm sure, and also at
rap-up before 3rd rock from the Suncasino. Or at least at Hooters
afterwards. Someone hand me the curlyfries.
Elway's going to throw and throw and no one can run fast enough
to keep up with his nerves. He'll get over the jitters after they
lose, or the crystal meth wears off. Whichever comes first.
Rolling Stones buggin for Pepsi. I could get some mileage outa
that one - but I won't go there. 
FAO Schwartz, Visa AND Converse all in one elephant, I mean ad.
Wait, it's the Budweiser Blimp. I didn't know there was a...
Hey, who killed Goodrich? (Or did I say that last year???)
Oh man, I missed the ferret while I was in the can. Came back and
everyone with a beer belly my size or bigger had both arms flailing
around going, "...and then the ferret said, and then..."
"...and this ferret turns his head and says..."
Musta been a kodiak moment and I missed it. 
There are only about 15 Packer fans in this whole building and me
and the Fuzzy Grape strippers make 6 of them. 
I sense a bit of New England 1 year old grudge, huh? You can smell
it. 
Mahatma Ghandi for Oracle, or did I miss something.
"...and then Ghandi takes off his glasses and says..."
Pre-teens for AT&T Angela likes Bobby Let's spam the Bud Blimp.
If you get hit in the head with a 40 yard bomb and wake up in the
bleachers can you tell whether you're in Qualcomm or 3com???
telnet> whois www.unintel.com
2008 Olympics. yeah. If the earth don't pop first.
FedX for GenX I'm FedUp. Some boob with dancing kangaroos got a 
great power madison avenue job instead of me just because his
bachelors degree was bigger. I got your ad hangin...
Hormel Chili takes the cake. I'll be back after I puke.
So we're up to 2 or 3 million a minute. Or was that 15 seconds?
Royal Carribean International. No there's another cheapskate...
"How much to just slip our name in there every so often?"
Nissan 229 a month.
       Datsun heard from!
Mazda. Right after. How do you follow THAT up? Ah, like so.
Piston engine go boing, boing, boing. But the wide receiver goes...
                   
            1/2  t i m e      ! ! !

Whoopie and Sinbad sittin in a tree, s c h mooz ooz i n g...

And besides Jewel that aren't Republican?
Good job Smokey. Now go home and pick up your H.M.M.W.V.
Martha Van & the Dellas. Queen Latifa.
Boyz 2 men. OK there's my answer. Don't nobody tell me they're
really 49 and/or Libertarian moving toward repub... I'd be heavy
dissed.


"That sucks, a flag at fourth down? Field goal and then maybe back 
in for a touchdown?!?" Boy do New England/Coloraday fans whine or
what?!?
Sprint got their /\
                 \/  on holmgren's earphone. 1 million american???

Qualcomm for the second revolution. 
Kramer for Hilfiger, now that's not half bad.

United Way -- Phuck you!!!
Brown County wisconsin has just got to be humming with pre-riot
