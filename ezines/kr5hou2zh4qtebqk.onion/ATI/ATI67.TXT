MADISON, WI. (PAWN(Prime Anarchist World News))
ATI REACHES 500,000 NEW SUBSCRIBERS.
   Activist Times, Inc. reached more than five hundred thousand new subscribers last
week when an angry subscriber forwarded his copy of ATI 66 to his local FBI operative.
   "I never subscribed to the thing," said the unnamed assailant. "I don't know who put
me up to this, but I was so mad I called the FBI." He forwarded a copy of ATI66 to Double
Agent Seymore N. Butts, who then emailed it to his entire crime listserver.
    "We couldn't find any crime there," Butts said of the entire bureau, "but it sure was an
interesting read."
    "That Anarchist guy isn't all there, though," Butts said. "He said it (ATI66) would be the sex
issue, but we didn't even find any animals or anything there." Butts then said he looked up ATI
issues 1-62 on various webpages across the information superhighway. Then Butts headed to
the local pub with 40 pounds of ATI backissue printouts to show the rest of his team.
   "Not a single naked lady," Butts said as he slammed the door to his LTD. "Must be one of those
politically correct commie pinko fag feminazi dudes."

BILLINGS (Montana). The first case of wire fraud was tried in 1869 when the owner
of a SAAB 911 called 911 to get her car unlocked and the operator instructed her to 
use a coathanger and slip it in the window. The coathanger ripped her upholstery 
so she sued and won on grounds that she was defrauded in being told to use a wire
hanger when a plastic one would have sufficed. The operator agreed to pay the 
settlement in installments and that's when  Payme, Montana changed its name to Billings.

SCHOOL OF THE AMERICAS  by Shell Stern Feb 6, 1997. (Continued from ATI66)
   Oh there are many right-wingers who would want us to believe that SOA plays
a crucial role in promoting democracy and human rights in Latin America (and under
their breath mutter something about protecting US economic interests.) Hmm, that's
odd, why then in October, 1996 would Amnesty International launch official investigations concerning the training manuals at SOA and urge the US government to assume responsibility for human rights violations committed by military personell trained there? Is it just a fluke that a United Nations Truth Commission report on El Salvador stated that over two thirds of the officers cited for the worst atrocities were alumni of SOA? These are only two examples that aided in the creation of a long list of graduates that have taken part in major human rights abuses in many Latin American countries. With so many contradictions, can there be any legitimate purpose for the School of the America's existance?
   For me this information is completely impossible to ignore. In the military's 260 million dollar budget there is 18.4 million dollars for SOA. Somewhere in that big stack of 18.4 million worn, burnt out dollar bills is at least one that has my name written all over it. As tax paying citizens WE are the ones who need to say the School of the Americas has to cease operation immediately! Friends, I do not believe that five hundred people stormed in on  SOA last November because it was a great place for a picnic. I also do not believe that grandmothers, priests and nuns were getting arrested for civil disobedience because they had nothing better to do that day. I met a woman who was one of the sixty arrested. Hearing her powerful words and non-violent approach, accompanied with the contents of the "School of the Assassins" 18 minute video, I was determined to begin my own investigation of SOA.
   Every day I discover a new article on SOA and each time I reflect on it I realize that we are all called in some way to work for justice. Each time I talk to someone else who has read about this scandalous school we become even more determined and motivated to spread the word. Won't you please join us in the struggle to shutdown this school of assassins? This April (date to be announced) we will try...

To Whom It May Concern
This is my last notice to you:
I have never subscribed to your list.
I have asked you (3) times to unsubscribe.
You have ignored my three requests.
Any further e-mail from you will be recorded
and forwarded to the Federal Bureau of 
Investigation (FBI) for investigation of
violations of the Telecommunications Act.
Sincerely,
Michael Williams
Director,
Williams Institute.

     (Editor's response was: Michael Williams,
       You have not asked me 3 times to unsubscribe. You
        Wrote a SECOND time. I had already struck your name
          From my list. I have no idea who gave me your name as 
           Someone wishing to receive my free newsletter. I am sorry
             For any misunderstandings. You won't hear from me again.
              You have a very hot head and I believe someone ought to take
                Your modem away, but I keep that to myself telling only you, for 
                  It is not my place to judge ANYONE, much less you.  (sic)
                          I promise never to contact you again unless in direct reply to an
                     E-mail from YOU. In fact, Mr. Williams, I will start an actual "do not e-mail"
                       List and keep it next to my telephone. That should satisfy your FBI friends
                        Just fine. 
                             Good bye.)

"Gimme a hectare or two. That's all I need."
       
Thesis: (notice the plural of thesis rhymes with feces???)
    Perhaps more important than a separation of church and state
    Would have been a separation of money and power? 
     Maybe that's a better reason for reopening  the 
US Constitution than the three other  reasons being
mentioned lately.
     Imagine some checks and balances in play that leave it 
possible to have a lot of money and no power, or a lot of
power and no money.
IMAGINE HAVING NEITHER YET FEELING EMPOWERED.
            I suggest we 
DEMAND A CONSTITUTIONAL CONVENTION NOW. 
Perhaps the blue ridge mountains this time instead of
Philly? Maybe Americus Georgia or Pine Ridge, SD???
