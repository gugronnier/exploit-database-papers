Hey Prime,
I figgered you'd dig this quote from Allen Ginsberg from 
a recent interview. Well no real recent. He's dead. 
/The ban also stretches apparently to cover the internet. I ask 
Ginsberg is he into technology or the information superhighway?/
"No," he laughs. "I have one of those laptop PC's but I don't know how
to work it. I have an office and a secretary who knows all about it.
She's gonna teach me someday."
Joe Camel.

I'm not sure which photo you refer to here.  (last issue's Allen Ginsberg
photo) A photo by Joe Daniels of four
women & Peter & Allen meditating on the tracks with the train in the
background, was published in People Magazine in the summer of '78.  Same
photo is in the Pocket Poets Series #40 edition of Plutonian Ode, but there
the date is in error.   The photo was taken _June_ 14 or 16th - I can't
find my summons right now, a month before Ginsberg notes he completes the
poem in Boulder (line 50-51).  "A Year of Disobedience," (text by Keith
Pope, photos by Joe Daniel) where the poem was also published, noted the
date of the photo as June 16.  Ginsberg & Orlovsky had been spending quite
a bit of time during the previous few weeks "on the tracks", reading,
talking, chanting, meditating with us.  "The tracks" was a peace camp
before the women of Greenham gave global currency to the concept.
& I was almost there.  I was arrested that morning when the train was on
its way in to Rocky Flats, and  friend & housemate Mary Lowers was one of
the women joining Allen & Peter & three others on the tracks that afternoon
when the train came out.  In Joe Daniel's photo, Carrie Grabo is on the
left, next to Peter and then Allen, and on the other side of the tracks
are, left to right, my friend Mary, Alice Braverman and a women whose name
escapes me now.  It was great.  The cops & RF security thought they had
cleared the tracks after the morning bust, and they prevented people from
re-occupying while the train was in the plant.  The Joe Daniels photo was
taken as the train crested a slight rise before descending down to the main
line, and as the conductor peered over the close horizon, he spotted the
six meditating and screeched to a halt.  Outwitted cops came running from
up on the road, behind the train,to find the spoilers of their operation on
the tracks.
I remember Ginsberg most from this time, when I first was exposed to his
poetry, & listening to the poetry of Blake (Tiger, Tiger) accompanied by
squeezebox, sitting with 40 others on facing rails, a cork in Rocky Flats
butt.

(PACKER) - PRIME ANARCHIST CHICKEN KWIKIE EDUCATIONAL REVIEW.
    Kenny Rogers Chicken in HMF hotel chains providing room service.
    Don't believe the ads hawking convenience. "It's going to be a cross
between a microwave and a convection oven," Says Kenny in a national press
conference. He believes you will find it delicious even at 4 a.m. A desk
clerk, he claims, could push the buttons and get you that delicious meal.
    Bottom line? 
    Almost 20 people in each hotel near you are going to be laid off. 
Victims of corporate downsizing at its ugliest. Don't believe a word you
see on tellie.

A quick pap#'s run and then we're off to the unabomber stuff...

PART V OF MARC FRUCHT'S GUIDE TO THE UNABOMBER'S MANIFESTO
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
     "by way of reopening government... here are the words I think
     were more important than that which NYTimes and WASHPost picked."
                           -=)-
114....modern man is strapped down by a network of rules and regulations
and his fate depends on the actions of persons remote from him whose
decisions he cannot influence. This is not accidental or a result of the 
arbitrariness of arrogant bureaucrats. It is necessary and inevitable in any
technologically advanced society. The system HAS to regulate human behavior
closely in order to function. At work people have to do what they're told...
or production would be thrown into chaos... It is true some restrictions
on our freedom could be eliminated, but GENERALLY SPEAKING the regulation of
our lives by large organizations is necessary for the functioning of 
industrial-technological society. The result is a sense of powerlessness on
the part of the average person. It may be, however, that formal regulations
will tend to increasingly be replaced by psychological tools that make us
want to do what the system requires of us. (propoganda, educ. techniques,
"mental health" programs, etc.)
123. If you think that big government interferes in your life too much NOW,
just wait till the government starts regulating the genetic constitution of
your children. Such regulation will inevitibly follow the introduction of
genetic engineering of human beings, because the consequences of 
unregulated genetic engineering would be disastrous.
NOTE 19. Just think an irresponsible genetic engineer might create a lot
of terrorists.
125. It is not possible to make a LASTING compromise between technology and
freedom, because technology is by far the more powerful social force and
continually encroaches on freedom through REPEATED compromises...
127. A technological advance that appears not to threaten freedom often
out to threaten it very seriously later... Since the introduction of 
motorized transport the arrangement of our cities has changed in such a
way that the majority of people no longer live within walking distance of 
their jobs, shopping areas and recreation, so that they HAVE TO depend
on the automobile for transportation. Or else they must use public 
transportation, in which case they have even less control over their own
movement than when driving a car... (when a new item of technology
is introduced as an option that an individual can accept or not as he 
chooses, it does not necessarily REMAIN optional. In many cases the new
technology changes society in such a way that people eventually find
themselves FORCED to use it.)


PART II OF "Children Of Wood And Metal" by Shadow.
(Con't from last issue)
"it can be a bit disjointed unless the reader knew it was a fictional
story about the "Unabomber" (suspect). So here's the story about the 
alleged Unabomber, a hermit who lived in Montana..."

   The man named Ted did not notice their scorn. He might have noticed it
three days ago when his sole preoccupation was getting his spring crop 
planted. But not now. Now the words of the article he had read crowded 
out all other awareness.
   "...a researcher at CalTech has discovered a genetic marker that can
identify the potential of criminal or antisocial behavior..."
   Ever since he saw them, Ted felt the slow rage building. Like some old
steam-driven engine, grinding its gears, building power and heat to some 
inexorable climax. How to stop it, how to power it down?
   Ted gripped the bicycle handles. "I swore I wouldn't do it again."
he bowed his head helpless before the power overtaking him. Where did it
start, he wondered... when was the connection made between his own wretched
life and the larger imprisonment against which he was compelled to fight?
   "They laid me on the altar of science..." an old grievance welled up; 
my brain and soul a sacrifice to the New Religion. Genius boy, smarter than
the rest. He doesn't know how to carry on a normal conversation, but that's
alright, someday he'll be building Rockets for the US of A.
   Ted swerved to avoid a broken beer bottle in the road.
(Con't next issue...)

JOURNAL POEM 6 by Marc Frucht

50 mete(o)rs per hour;
Quite a shower to see.
Playing Celtic music;
Drinking coffee at Java
At the Hut eating the "Longest
French fries in Colorado,"
I read "Continued On Back Flap,"
By Sue Dunham.

Chapel of the Open Air uses the
Thomas Jefferson version of 
The Bible. Pavilion protects
Overhead, logs to sit on;
Unfinished lumber lectern.
Long walks in the park, just B4 dark,
Married couple - listening to
Seperate walkman stereos
As they stroll the walkway.
Who needs canteen hiking when
7-11's every hundred yards?

Splast (n) from Coloradan - "blast"
Early Rhode Islandan "splash," to
Have a great deal of fun, wet.
"Splastic," using rubber rafts in
Said funmaking. "Splasm" having 
Simply too much water fun.
Eg: "Bring your friends over to the
Flash flood. We're having a splast."

Thanks for the etymology
Earl Grey.
