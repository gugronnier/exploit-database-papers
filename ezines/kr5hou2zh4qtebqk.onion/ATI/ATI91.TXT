Has anyone heard Jim Nader for NPR's ANNOYING MUSIC Show?
   He calls it "3 minutes of Hell you can't turn off."

And now a poem...

  The Man In The Tabasco Tie.   by marco

The man in the Tabasco tie faces me signing off an override
To a bar on my registration so I can get started on my 
Classes.

An Alexy van Schleppe hangs on the wall huge behind him
Facing me as well. I mistake it for a Goya. No, he tells me it's a
Van Schleppe.

Part of the school's permanent collection.
His tie says McIlhney and looks like a bad Picasso. Chili peppers and
Bottles.

The dean of my school used to be our Physics prof. He signs off and I go
Out and see the ocean from campus, Red Hot Chili Peppers running thru 
My head, I decide my reason for taking
Classes

Is so I can drink
Bottled
Water and look at Van Schleppe paintings 
Take marine biology classes and learn about the
Ocean
And daydream about what this point must've looked like 1000 years ago.

Probably no bottles, 
And likely no classes,
Definitely no bars on your registration because you don't have proof of the 
Last 5 times You've been vaccinated for measles/rubella.
But there was certainly van Schleppes, even before
Van Schleppe was a van Schleppe. 


and another poem from his holiness (not your Dolly Llama...)

Marco: here's version one... 
Gotta ad more, so it will be done,
But if the text catches your eye
I guess it's suitable for ATI!

A Day In The Life Of A Netaholic
-----------------------------------------------
It's nighttime again, (for me that's dawn),
  The sun shows it's rays, and I start to yawn.
But if you need to send me some shout,
  I'll try to read, before I pass out.
So next time we meet, if there's dents in my head,
  You'll know I used keys for a pillow instead.
And when I awake, and notice the screen,
  I'll feel my head ache, and go take a pee.
Then a hot mug, to start my long day,
  Just thinking of keys, banging my face.
And when the caffeine, has done it's job well,
  I'll tell those square keys, to go straight to hell!
But now I just sigh, cause my fix is email,
  A technology high, hope power won't fail.
This internet thing is way out of hand,
  Someone to ping is what I now am.
But then I think back, and remember a time,
  When all I had was a voice on a line.
And then I recall, it's in this new place,
  She sent me a pic of her beautiful face!
So now I, I think: yea! this is so cool!
  Just surfin the waves, and swimming the pools.
Now it's daytime once more, (for me that's the night).
  The sun has gone down, but the screen is my light.
So here I just sit, surfing away...
 I wonder who I'll chat with today.

PSST... PSST.. Hey, you wanna hear where HmmBop came from?
I found out where that song was stolen/inspired (take your pick) from.
Fleetwood Mac's RUMORS album. I forget which song in particular. The one
with A D and E just the same. They changed the "scatting" it called for
ever so slightly and called it a whole new song.

         5 years after the quincentennial:
         It's Time to:
               MAKE OCTOBER 12TH
            INDIGENOUS PEOPLES DAY,

      Free Leonard Peltier,
       Stop Forced Relocation at Big Mountain,
       and Build a Movement for Justice
         and Human Rights for All!

       Five years ago, in 1992, hundreds of thousands, if not millions
of people throughout the Americas spoke out and acted in opposition
to the government sponsored celebrations of Christopher Columbus and in
support of the rights of indigenous peoples.
        However today, in 1997, AIM activist Leonard Peltier sits in 
prison during this 21st year of incarceration for an act the government knows
he did not commit. It has been revealed that the FBI withheld from his
trial evidence that proves his innocence.
        In northeast Arizona, in the Black Mesa area, 3,000 indigenous
people are fighting forced relocation from their land because Peabody
Western Coal Company wants it to make profits.
        And there are numerous other examples of both continuing repression
and continuing resistance by indigenous peoples against violations of
their rights.
        Join with people around the country who will be fasting from Oct 1 
through 12, fasting for part of that time, organizing local demonstrations
and actions, or acting in other ways in solidarity with Leonard Peltier,
the Big Mountain resisters, other struggling Native American peoples and
for the human rights of all.
        We will never be free in this country until we face up to the
historic record, set it straight and get it right. "Getting it right" means
honoring, upholding and joining in solidarity with those who have much
to teach us about living in harmony with the natural world, about working
cooperatively for the good of all, and about steadfastness in struggle
despite the most difficult conditions. We urge you to join us this October.

I end this edition of ATI, issue 91
with JOURNAL POME 19 from Marc Frucht's book "I SLURP MY COFFEE: Journal
Pomes 1-33."

JOURNAL POME 19.
ded: to drunk; to fuck

9am: No Haiku. Bloody Marys and
Darts in Manitou Pub over fried
Hoki fish on whole wheat toast.
It's said chewing ice means a
lack of sex, or maybe just iron.
Blackstrap molasses an aphrodesiac??
Sage. Dylan sings "Masters Of War,"
But hardly anyone notices the words.
Who's boycotting Grammy's THIS year?
Watching "Dobie Gillis" reruns from
Atop mountain-bike in front of
Wally World's window-front.
Purple and blue dreams over hot
Brown coffee at a wine-red IHOP;
A majestic sunset out the window.
Sunday sunrise reflects Cheyenne.
Knee deep in reality; not weird
Enough for me. Jello, cottage cheese,
A pear and three Orange Juices -
Talk about your acid...
Then the "Ferret Crew" checks out
Tunnels connecting from Cheyenne
Mountain to Pikes Peak. Though...
    NORAD never blinks.
Glutimus hurtimus maximus: & what
Will help allay pain of bicycle
Butt. Want of devil's claw, burdock
Root and blackstrap molasses.

C-130 slams into Angolan mountain.
Cargo? CIA says TOP SECRET.
Author suggests:
Dead soldiers & dry ice.
"...you that hide behind desks..."
Dancing in snow on the foothills
Making onkh, peace-sign, anarchy,
Pentagram and snow angel.
"...know I can see thru your masks..."

2-4am. Called "Owl's Hours."
Not sure if 2morrow's 2day,
Or 2day's 2nite or 2morrow.
So Carl orders catholic
Transvestite salad with
The cross dressing, snickers - & 
Tells me about Wally wanker and
The chippity doo da sarsparilla
Root sodie pop factory.

Techno check: Magazine rack
Made of #SE-6 virgin vinyl.
What-in-the-universe?!?
5-piece midi band. One canned

Brushes, another synthed sax,
Viola, cello and flute are
Really virtually there.
These guys wear black & white,
Sitting behind sheet music.
1st #'s an instrumental:
Vainright's "Dead Skunk in the
Middle of the Road." What?!?
        Go figure.

So Mecca absconds all of Medina's
   Funny looking grapefruits.
       Note on fridge:
         Ate 'em all.
          So green.
           Delisch
