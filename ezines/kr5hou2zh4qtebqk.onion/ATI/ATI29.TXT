                   Jungle Survival
                   ---------------
            By: Digital Destruction (604)

         Hello once again, ATI freaks, it's me   again with some more
         hints to get you   through those pesky situations which
         always manage to mess up your dinner     reservations...This
         time, Jungle War   Tactics.
           Has there ever been a time when you   were taking a
         leisurely walk through the Amazon jungle only to realize by
         way of a note pinned to a tree by a spear that you were being
         stalked by headhunters? At that moment I'll bet most of you












         said to yourselves 'Gee, I wish I knew some Jungle war
         tactics!'..Well Here's the    break youve been looking for.

         Knife trick:
         ------------

         To kill your enemy by way of excruciatin pain, use this
         method. Sharpen many    hardwood sticks, and plant point-up
         in  a patch of land -on a trail, for        instance- and
         cover in fesces. Then     cover it all with leaves or
         something   and when Bongo and Umgala come after    you, they
         will step on the sticks, get  driven into their feet (And if
         they fell their bodies), and if that dont kill em then blood
         poisoning from the feces    will.

         Pond Trick
         ----------
         If you can find a very still pond, you  can plant the sharp
         sticks in this, but you dont have to, and then cover with
         grass, leaves etc. They will think it is land and SPLOOSH.

         Well, those two tricks should do it.    (I cant think of any
         more!) So
         until next time, Hasta!




                 'Good Time' Tear Gas
                 --------------------
                 By: Digital Destruction (604)

         Okay everyone, it's time to cook!
         It seems to me, that an insurance       seminar just wouldnt
         be any fun without some good potent tear gas. Am I right?
         Well anyway, As I was walking through  my local K-Mart I was
         approached by     the King, Elvis himself who instructed  me
         by divine intervention to write this file so here goes.

         To make real potent tear gas, it's      relatively simple.

         Ingredients:
         ------------
         2 lbs. of red pepper seeds
         A handy-dandy Popeil Percolater
         A perfume bottle or Binaca Blaster

         Procedure:
         ----------
         Place seeds, 1/2 pound at a time and    perk (perk?) for an
         hour or two. Scoop  the seeds out and you will have about 2
         tablespoons of the most potent resin    I've seen. Put this
         with a little
         Tabasco in a squirter and there ya go.  The seeds can also be












         reused for fun... The next time you go see 'Camille' in the
         movies, toss a few off the balcony!   Hee Hee....Anyway, this
         is Digital
         Destruction telling you, when the earth collides with the
         sun, try to stay out  of the backblast.


              The Calcium Carbide Grenade
              ---------------------------
             By:  Digital Destruction(604)

         Ya know, one of the things I like       about this country is
         that anyone can   build their very own anti-personell
         grenade using store bought everyday     materials. In this
         file I will discuss  how to build one of these babies.
         It should be known that when this       grenade is exploded
         it produces a cloud of thick grey smoke 40 feet in diameter
         hovering 3 feet above the ground in    which nobody can see
         or breathe with    just a hint of shrapnel to top off the
         event, so I wouldnt go throwing it at   your local boy scout
         parade for a       'good laugh'...Procede with caution...
         There are still a lot of angry Indians  left over from
         Bhopal.

         Ingredients needed:
         -------------------
         250 grams of Calcium Carbide
         (You can buy this stuff in any hardware store as lantern
         fuel)

         1 Coca-Cola can (Washed and dried)

         1 100ml test tube (pyrex)

         1 rubber cork

         Duct tape

         Procedure:
         ----------

         Funnel 180-250g of Cal. Carbide into the can so it is about
         1/4 full. Then,     remembering to keep it AWAY from water,
         put aside. Fill test tube to 100ml and   cork. MAKE SURE the
         outside of this is COMPLETELY dry. Any excess water on the
         cork or outside of the tube will make   YOU an instant
         victim! Then, carefully  insert test tube into hole in top of
         can so it rests on bed of C.C.. Drop dots  of wax around
         opening to hermetically   seal opening, and wrap the whole
         thing  in duct tape. When thrown, upon impact, the test tube
         will break, scattering    water all over the C.C. creating a
         gaseous reaction resulting in 600lbs    per square inch of
         pressure which will  last about 5 seconds. the can will
         explode, shrapnel will fly and the gas  will go. Here is a












         picture of how it    should look.

                  !CARBIDECCCC!
                  -------------
         Remember. Carbide gas is a cancer
         causing toxin and is fatal.

         Now you have your own anti-personell
         grenade! Won't Mom be surprised!
         Have fun.....And be careful.
         Until next time, VIVA REVOLUTION!
