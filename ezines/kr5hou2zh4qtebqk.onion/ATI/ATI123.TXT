Hello and welcome to ATI issue 123.
I'm Prime Anarchist and here you have my edited addition to prosterity.
Or was that additive edition for posperity? Prosperity? Posterity. Yeah.
An edited edition of popularity. OK enough already. You want numbers.
You want parodies. You sent stuff in. Here goes.

Tomorrow is Palm Sunday, so remember to check your hands for hair.
No, don't set your clocks back, you missed it. Nice beard, Mr. Hirsute.

Letters From The Editors:
   It has come to our attention that many hackers, for everything else 
they know, do not know how to strip away part of a URL. This seemed 
strange to us because, well, you know. Never mind. Here's a quick tutorial
so you can recite the famous hacker mantra, "I knew that." The quicker you
say that at the end of this t-phile, the better a hacker you are.

This idea spawned by Barbizcon School of Hacking. Be a hacker, or just 
look like one.

http://www.geocities.com/ResearchTriangle/Lab/5851 shows you a page.
http://www.geocities.com/ResearchTriangle/Lab will show you a different
page.

For this t-phile we won't go into the diff between /Lab and /Lab.index.html
ok? Get that somewhere else.

http://www.geocities.com/ResearchTriangle will show you an entirely 
different page as will
http://www.geocities.com

Get it? That should save wear and tear on your back key and your 
clicker finger and once in a while you'll stumble on extra neat elite 
things that "no one else" knows about. Sometimes not even the webmaster!!!

In case you don't here's another example:
http://www.public.iastate.edu/cgi-bin/finger?prime@anarchist.com
will let you finger our editor.
http://www.public.iastate.edu/cgi-bin/finger?prime@
will let you finger prime somewhere else. Put another addy where the space
is. 
http://www.public.iastate.edu/cgi-bin/finger?
lets you finger someone else. Try yourself, you egosurfer.
http://www.public.iastate.edu/cgi-bin lets you... hmmm. I'd better not
say.
http://www.public.iastate.edu  shows you a bunch of other stuff.
Get it? Got it? Good.
Those who don't, go to

SAN FELIPE
a Poem by Jaime Gutierrez.
Submitted Mon, 30Mar98 at 11am. (See? Aren't we fast.) 
Full moon across the gulf of Baja, 
sacred mountains and hills cradle the smooth sand and calm waters, 
an ancient white pyramid stands in the distant water
as a reminder of our splended immortality and eternal dreams,
subtle settlers rent and buy friendships and loyalties 
with their mighty dollars,
like their ancestors the colonizers currency rules immaculately,
bus loads of buegie spring break students from the U.S.'s shollowness
training grounds, come to see and be seen,
never really enjoying themselves or living the real dream.
Lone Xicanos in search of salvation, 
in a distant homeland only to find it's the same;
NAFTA turned all Mexicanos into Chicanos 
and Mexico into the largest barrio of the U.S.'s colony.
Betrayed love haunts my mind 
and unfaught revolutions calm my soul.
Aho
El Super Xicano

Sorry, architects. You keep putting V's where the U's go and 
I'll keep picking on you.

Last Gasp has the Crumbs. Go get 'em.
http://www.woof.com/last_gasp.html



OK here's a parody. To the tune of John Prine's Paradise
Actually, it's more like additional verses. Prime plays it all
around one into the other. Look it up, you'll see.

Then the Peabody shovel drove to northern Arizona
Where Navajo and Hopi were farming the land.
They're diggin for coal and uraniium (u-rane-ee-eye-eye-um)
Assumin' dead Indians'll just understand.

And Daddy won't you take me back to th'sacred 4 mountains
Dinebeto Wash where the Black Mesa lay.
Well I'm sorry my son but you're too late in askin'
Mr. Peabody's coal train is haulin' it away.

(There's other verses, butcha not gettin' em.)


This one's to "Love is a Many Splendered Thing.
Cash is a many tendered thing.
It's the only choice of them that don't have everything.
Cash is nature's way of saying
A better way of paying
Can not be found by even he who's king.

Once during 9:30 coffee break.
In the morning mist two schmoozers kissed 
And the world would quake.
Then they each decided to capitalize on it and sing.
Yes cash is a very, very splendid! Well tendered, splendorific thing.

     .PMI.

Since there's no words to The Alley Kat I put my own in.

There was an alley cat in my garbage
H'ate up all a my trash.
Stuck his head down my out house
Gobbled up all a my ash.
I even tried geraniums in my garden
But he ate up everything.
Now we have no food to eat.
W'have to go grocery shopping. 

We hate that cat.
He's such a fat cat
They even wrote a song about him,
And that's that.

     .PMI.

OK. This one I didn't write. Carl Sandburg claimed that Mary Had a
Little Lamb was a parody of this song sung to ukelele or lute in the
halls of congress. 

Mary had a william goat, william goat, william goat.
Mary had a william goat his stomach lined with zinc.
One day he ate an oyster can, oyster can, oyster can.
One day he ate an oyster can and a clothesline full of shirts.
Oh the shirts can do no harm inside, harm ins...
Oh the shirts can do no harm inside, but the oyster can.

          .PMI.

This one I changed just a tiny bit.

Dorie Ador. Don't spit on the floor.
Spit out the door, that's what doors are for.
Or use the cuspidor 
If you cannot find the door.

%Moderators' comment: ATI is a nice antidote to those who see no
political consciousness amongst the CU. Like most e-mail mags, the
substance has slowly changed and matured over the years, and it is
becoming a nice mix of political, technical, and other information
of relevance to computerists.
Thanks to Ground Zero and Prime Anarchist for putting out a nifty
publication.

I end with a poem I wrote called Machinos.
Because after all is gone, 
all that is left is Myth.

I only like Connecticut 
At 2:30 in the summer morning.
When there's no traffic
And you can hear some birds
And they're saying
I only like Connecticut
At 2:30 in the summer morning.
When there's no traffic
And it doesn't matter 
If someone's playing three machines at a time, and
I don't care
Because I'm not there
And you can hear some birds
And they're saying 
I only like Connecticut
At 2:30 in the summer morning
When there's no casinos.
Traffic.
