Helo. Prime Anarchist here with another midweek crisis.
Stephen Jones is in Vail Colorado handling the Terry Nichols
Case. At least he's handling Wolfe Blitzchieg and CNN.
(You are Reading, A T I.)
His last big one besides the Timothy McVeigh-ride was what, OJ?
Let's see. He'll do the Unabomber next?
Now he's a busy man -- so after these two he'll sit it out until
they nab the guy who back in his 50's wrote the code that'll 
bring us all our millenium-year-two-thousand-troubles.
        I have a feeling people don't quite realize exactly what
went on under their noses this New Years. So I'll put it here.
        For the first time since the early 70's Led Zeppelin's 
STAIRWAY TO HEAVEN was NOT the most requested song of the year.
Tha's rye; U herd it 1st - hear. 
No, not Butterfly Kisses, you ninny. And Not your daughter's
La Macarooni. It was
<Clears Throat> pains me to verbalize this... FREEBIRD BEAT OUT
STAIRWAY. Yikes.
Everything Changes; Nothing Changes.
(You are Reading, A T I.)
Am I the only one what really wants to hear Terry Nichols' speech
to Judge Nittemenpickem? I can't wait to see what he says
although I'm sure I'll have to wait and read about it in the 
morning paper if I know media well enough, eh?
        I think what most don't realize is: them that
blew up the Fed Building are NOT leftist terrorist conspirators.
They were pawns of a recent (albeit decades old) groundswell of 
fanatical Christian Conservative creeps who believe in assassination.
Have you met any of these personally? They almost cause me beggin' for 
first ammendment exemptions!!! Scarey people they.
        This, by the way, is the same "arm" that tried to pump lead
into the Whitehouse twice. Do I need to even mention Arizona Forestry
Department's uncovering plans to blow up the Pentagon, White House
AND Observatory (where the second lady and her signific-other live)
which actually would've succeeded had it been implemented?
        I sure hope this doesn't get me quoted next to "TJ" Jefferson
hundreds of years from now:
        "Our 'Noble Experiment' should less fear external invasion,
         foreign terrorists or subversive lefto-politicos than its
         very own a-moral minority - the very ones who claim a
         'moral' 'majority' - the first third of our nation we've
         had so much trouble keeping in check for three centuries
         going."

> A PERFECT CORPORATION FOREVER
> The new order has finally come, buy your goods from Siemens only
> .....  or, Guide to a Succesful Corporation
>
> Siemens is a classical multinational corporation. It makes all kinds of

> machines, computers, refrigerators - things that ease the lives of busy
> people all over the world.   Every experienced housewife can tell you
> that. Every more or less experienced not-in-house-husband can add
> that Siemens and its subsidiaries make all these nice, small things for
> their lovely cars.
> (You are Reading, A T I.)
> As a "respectable" corporation (at least according to itself), Siemens
> has "MORE"  - and probably the most important business -
> nuclear power. One of the last giants in this industry, the German-based
> multinational continues to construct nuclear reactors outside of the
> so-called developed world.
>
> What a smart bug - those who didn't move
> from their benefit-only-for-corporations western world are dead already,
> for example Westinghouse.
>
> Basically we can say that Siemens is good corporate capitalist,
Westinghouse
> (for example), is a looser - all because of one small thing: you have to
pay
> for everything in this world, but in the east you pay much less than in
the

unprofitable
> business as a profitable one. That's part of 'The New Order' called
corporate
> world. Of course, Westinghouse tried but ...
> maybe it was too late, maybe they were too lazy, maybe it was not right
> country [Czech republic, conract for completion of Temelin NPP], maybe
I'm wrong.
>   But if I'm wrong it'd be me who was  the looser, not Westinghouse.
>
> Siemens is PERFECT for this 'World' - politically correct, profitable,
> likes to give Christmas presents to all of us. Not the absolutely first,
> but far from the end of the list of the most successful corporations.
> Moreover, Siemens knows how to show its business profitable.
That's very important know-how. I've heard
> that during its final days, Westinghouse was
> trying to buy this know-how with all the money they had left, but
obviously
> this was not enough for Siemens
>
> Well, by the way, you should know that it wasn't so easy to make money
> earlier this century when Siemens appeared on the globe market. During
> World War II, Germany was destroyed, economical ACTIVITY too low,
> absolute apathy. That was wrong direction for Siemens to invest money to
> the war.
>
> But what keeps life
> on the earth is only one principle -  HUMANS ARE BETTER AT
> DESTROYING LIFE THAN KEEPING IT HERE.... that's WHAT
> KEEPS HUMAN SOCIETY GOING/ALIVE/EVOLVING... In other words,
> analyze mistakes and know the time to change direction. Siemens appears
> perfect in that light again: investing money in Hitler's war, Siemens got
> a lot of slave labour during World War IIs - mainly
> Russian soldiers from concentration camps. That was a smart exchange.
> So you see, even Hitler worked for Siemens to some extent.  That's what
we call
> smart: even when anti-fascist troops entered Berlin, Siemens didn't have
to
> worry about its survival during an expected economic depression. Who
> cares that Siemens made money from war and death of soldiers? Every war
> processes a lot of life into death.
>
> That's was the setting upon which this corporation rose to power. When
> the economic situation started to feel better in Germany, who you think
> reconstructed it? Right, Siemens. Who else had money? Not the Nazis,
> escaped to third countries ; they took their money with them. But
shouldn't

images

a

>
> I live in a country when Siemens constructs nuclear reactors. You know it
> can be very politically incorrect business (nuclear safety, nuclear
weapon
> proliferation, development of nuclear technologies, different things that
> many troublemakers who, all of them just agents of other dirty playing

Well,
> sometimes a "perfect drug" brings along friends, like French-based
corporation
> COGEMA, but friends of our friends are our friends, right? Sometimes,
> Siemens even pays Ministry officials but if you think that a dirty game,
you

research

> doesn't really matter that these specialists get $200 salaries per month
> (because our country now is in economical trouble, a little bit, but we
> are staying optimistic with Siemens around.)
>
> So, political correctness. Every man managing a good corporation should
> know this rule.  At the same time, look at Siemens - they have a lot of
> friends among high-ranked politicans but a perfect corporation never
connecst
> its business interests with politicians (to stay politically-correct).
> Someone can say that our favorite corporation lobbies politicans to get
them
> to issue loans for Siemens' projects. That's not true! Politicians are
smart
> enough to see where it make sense to loan for commercial projects and
where
> it does not. But every sane person
> could see that if Siemens is involved in the project - especially in the

- (You are Reading, A T I.)
> that it definitely makes sense to help these projects financially. To
make
> economics growing up somewhere or
> simply implement the mission to civilize the other world, outside of

> make them happier. All of it will be
> reimbursed by three thousand times higher benefit.
>
> If you've heard something bad about their nuclear facilities' level of
> safety - that's wrong. Well, they constructed one reprocessing facility
> which doesn't work but it's not because it's bad. That's because Germany
is
> full of troublemakers, all these anarchists and environmentalists.

> So, what I was going to say... Yeah, buy Siemens' goods for Christmas,
buy
> Siemens' goods for New Year's Eve, buy Siemens for birthdays, buy Siemens
for
>  Independence Day, buy, buy, buy and one more time buy. Remember! Buy

                        What do you expect with
                        satanists running your
                        government, Marc?

                        As president, Bush

Happy New Year Prime Anarchist!!!  Cool e-mail address.


(You are Reading, A T I.)

README.TXT
ATI, your adfirm with a brainstorm
Your ad form for brain squirm
The antidote to global mind rot
Help and health 4 U alllllllllllll.

The readme.txt

If you found your way here you're in for a treat.

Rule #1. always read the readme's first.

Rule #2. never read the readme's.

Hack, hack and hack; and then recite after me; "Shit. I should've
read the readme's."

Activist Times, Inc. is a hacker magazine for many reasons, but
primarily because Prime Anarchist has been a hacker since he was a 
little boy. The only thing more constant than hacking in Anarchists
life has been music, and more specifically guitar.

Unless of course, you count his over redundant, mondo-abundant, ever
pragmaticant use of the third person.

Oh, and conversational word choice.

For after all is said and done: all we are is myth, rhetoric, 
propaganda, expression and of course THE EVENT.

What's a meta4-U?

Die Hacker-Hymne
by: Cheshire Catalyst. tradduciones: the self


Zu singen nach der Melodie: "Put another nickel in"

Put another password in
Bomb it out and try again
Try to get past logging in
We're hacking, hacking, hacking 

Try his first wife's maiden name. 
This is more than just a game. 
It's real fun, it is the same, 
It's hacking, hacking, hacking. 

Sys-call, let's try a sys-call. 
Remember the great bug freom v 3, 
Or R S X, it's a here! Whoppee! 

Put another sys-call in, 
Run those passwords out and then, 
Dial back up, we're logging in, 
We're hacking, hacking, hacking! 

deutsch:

Gib ein neues Pawort ein
Oft fliegst du raus, mal kommste rein
Schau genau beim Tippen zu
Wir hacken, hacken, hacken. 

Find vom Chef die Freundin raus
Probiere ihren Namen aus
Tast dich ran mit Ruh im Nu
Zum Hacken, Hacken, Hacken. 

Begreife endlich das System.
Dann hast du es ganz bequem
Was du willst das tu, ja tu
Du Hacker, Hacker, Hacker!
