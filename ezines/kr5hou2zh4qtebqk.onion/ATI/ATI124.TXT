Hola, que tal la familia??? Hej, welcome to ATI, issue 124. April 11,   
1998. First of this month was the anarchist newyear. Did you do anything? 
I just visited phamily. Kinda quiet beginning for a year, eh?
Next week is TurnOffYourTVWeek.
Can any of you even fathom 7 whole days with 
None of that blue haze?
   Funk?
   Yeah,
   Give it a try.

HTML Writer's Guild declared April Accessibility Month.
The word of the day is
Lynx, Lynx, Lynx.





       ATI group Research Project of the Year.
       Compare and contrast.
       Salem Witch Trials vs. HUAC Trials.
       Salem vs. Bennett, Lieberman et. al,

I do agree that we have to do something for aliens that are coming
earth. First, we do welcome them because they might be our friends
to help us, not eneny. Second, we can take a lot of knowlege they have
and give them our ones.

PDP. Public Domain Parodies, brought to you by Prime Anarchist Productions.
The makers of Cottage Fleas for 35 centuries now.

1st one. to the tune of FRIED HAM, FRIED HAM, CHEESE & BOLOGNA.
Dyed spam, dyed spam
Fleas and spumone,
NAFTA is acrimony
Us have funions (tm)
Pickles and spetzel
Then we'll have some 
More dyed spam, dyed spam, dyed spam.
   (next verse: Dried Spam... everything else the same.)
   (last verse: Diet Spam...)
   (repeat 1st verse, fade)

2nd one. (these two are parodic subtleties. Or was that subtle parodies?)
         to the tune of the Gillete commercial
Look sharp, feel sharp, be sharp (that's a C)
To look sharp every time you shave,
To feel sharp and be on the ball,
Just be sharp,
Use Gillette's new blades
'Cause they take the least
Face of all.

3rd one. to the toon of Mackie D's (the 1971 one)
So much life to be lived. 
So much to be tried.
And when you share it you get
A special feeling inside.
It's a full time thing.
The kind of life that you lead.
A little break from it all
Is the break that you need.
You deserve a break today.
So get up and get away
From McDonald's.
Eat something else instead.

4th one. (wait there's more...)
         tune of Across the Universe 1968 by John Lennon (with a little
         help from his Paul McCartney...)
Words are flowing out like endless rain into a coffee cup,
They slither while they slurp, they slip away,
Across the Universe.
Some tomorrow try a cup each hour for a clearer mind,
Possessing and caressing me. 
Java Guru, Deva. Ohm. 
Nothing's gonna change my world.
Nothing's gonna change...

Images of broken light which dance before me like a carousel,
They call me on and on Across the Universe.
Thoughts meander like a restless wind-sock in an airport runway,
Tumbleweeds eat Denver Boots,
Way across the Universe.

Sounds of laughter shades of earth are ringing through my opened ears,
Inciting and inviting me.
Limitless the clouds above which shine around me
Like a bunch of mugs of cappucino
Across the Universe...

5th and final parody. to the tune of:
    Wabash Canonball. (prime note: 1st verse is real. 2nd is mine.)
Listen to the jingle the rumble and the roar,
As you glide along the woodlands 
o'er the hills and by the shore.
Hear the mighty rush of the engines
Hear the lonesome hoboes squall.
As you travel cross the country
On the Wabash Canonball.

Feel a little nudge now as they change from diesel fuel.
You'll be on your way in minutes
For your destination due.
Hear the wimpy hum of the motors
Hear the lonesome whiporwhill.
As you travel up the country 
On the mighty Montree-ill.
    Well I went down south
    Just to see my Sal
    Singin' polly wolly doodle all the day
    My Sally am one spunky gal 
    Singin' polly wolly doodle all the day
    Fare thee well, fare thee well,
    Fare thee well my farie Fay,
    Well I'm goin' to Louzianna,
    For to see my Pollyana
On the Wabash Cannnnnnnnnnnnon ball.

     (bow, smile, get the heck off the stage before they
      chuck rotton fruits and veggies.)


This shall be the biggest, nicest, cleanest, "currentest" PAP numbers
run you will've ever seen. (Maybe 'til next time, eh?)

Ready for a poem?

Posted by turtle on April 05, 1998 at 01:48:31:

Anonymous Eskimo:


Into my head rose
the nothings
my life day after day
but I am leaving the shore 
in my skin boat
It came to me that I was in danger
and now the small troubles
look big
and the ache
that comes from the things
I have to do every day
big

But only one thing 
is great
only one
This
In the hut by the path
to see the day
coming out of its mother
and the light filling the world

---translation by W.S. Merwin

CALL FOR PARTICIPANTS

World War Correspondents Encounter
November 24-27, 1998
Havana, Cuba

The Jose Marti International Institute of Journalism (IIPJM), Cuban
Journalists Union (UPEC), and other national and international co-
sponsors invite you to this unique opportunity to meet each other and
exchange experiences.
The event coincides with the respective 100 and 30th year anniversaries
of the Spanish-Cuban-US War in 1898 and Che Guevara's foundation of
Radio Rebelde in the Sierra Maestra.
All people who have risked their lives spreading truth in high-risk 
situations have had similar experiences.
Let's come together and share them under the theme of :

THOSE WHO HAVE LIVED WAR DEFEND PEACE!

Topics at the Encounter will include, but are not limited to:
1.  New informational technology in War Journalism; the search for 
    news in conflicts.
2.  The journalist as a peacekeeper, fighter and in negotiations.
3.  The image of War as a memoir of human history.
4.  International Humanitarian Law; journalistic ethics in high-risk 
    actions.
5.  Globalization and commercialization of war in mass media, and the
    manipulation of information in armed conflict.

Film makers and camera operators interested in projecting their 
work must communicate the content and technical requirements of 
their films or videos.

PROGRAM

  Five work panels as indicated above
  One person and group photo exhibits
  Projections of films and videos
  Guest lectures
  Commemorative day for deceased war correspondents
  A day for bilateral encounters between correspondents 
  from the following areas:
  AFRICA AND THE MIDDLE EAST
  SUBSAHARAN AFRICA
  LATIN AMERICA AND THE CARIBBEAN
  EUROPE
  ASIA

At the end of the conference there will be organized trips to:
  -The Border Brigade at the US Navy base in Guantanamo, Cuba
  -Playa Giron, site of the Bay of Pigs Invasion, and a visit to the
   Che Guevara Mausoleum

Registration fee:
80.00 USD
Payable upon registration in Havana, includes credentials, 
documents and rights to participate in all events, 
as well as a certificate of attendance.


      OVERHEARD IN A PIZZA JOINT...     
                 by step-x
      Quien es Zoltec?
      Seems like he's some kind of enemy of the local
      casinos here.

      Shapiro's coming -- didn't get a first name.
      He got fired from Bally Las Vegas.
      A couple guys eating pizza here are
      wagering he'll be "in these parts"
      within a week looking for work here
      and/or Atlantic City.

      They're talking about what a "vast wasteland"
      a bunch of different towns were before 
      their people moved in and opened casinos.
      I should've written faster to remember all the
      towns. One was Memphis. I didn't want to let on
      that I was writing every word I heard.

      This reminds me of store-front Charismatic
      Christian-looking churches moving into slums
      to take advantage of the survivors' needs to
      believe in "something - anything."

      So Roger, just how many Flint, Michigans 
      *ARE* there in this corporation we call a
      country?

      Oh, but the economy never looked better did it?
      FROM WHOSE PERSPECTIVE? 

      I mean I'm comfortable. You're comfortable. Sure.
      But let me ask you one question.
         (ed note: promise not to quote Dylan?)
      How many people in this country couldn't read this
      very document right now if they wanted to? 
      
      Factor in literacy, access to internet, leisure time
      after jobs and sleep, and poorly written proxy-server
      filtering systems.

      I'll give you a hint. It will be easier to count who
      CAN see this, than who CAN'T.

                  #


We'll end this one with a broadside instead of a poem.
4 poetics take many a form.
And remember, beware the rhymes you make. 
They all come true.
(also, beware the covers you play.
They seem to send you to the same 
Little hell, eh?)

additional folk verses to Roll In My Sweet Baby's Arms.

I could have a big old Camaro
Or a gas guzzlin' Cadillike.
But I took all my cash
And fast as a flash,
Picked up a thousand dollar mountain bike.

G - / - D7 / G C / D7 G

I could buy a brand new TV
Or RayBan yellow sunglasses indeed.
But every week I get what I oughta
And I already got what ever'thin' I need.
