Howdy! Welcome to ATI46. I know it's been a while. But, we should be getting
on a regular schedule from now on.. like every 2 weeks or so. Thanks for all
of your support in the recent months. ATI's readership has been growing, and
we've been getting a lot of positive feedback. Keep the comments, positive and
negative, coming! 

This issue brings some new contributors, namely Sk8 The Skinhead (313) and
TI-Man (201). Look for their contributions later in upcoming issues! 

Also, we are happy to announce the return of a BBS run by The Mentor of LOD
called The Phoenix Project. It's an excellent board that I highly reccomend.
Call it at 512-441-0229 for the most stimulating discusion of computer and
telecom-related subjects!

Speaking of BBSs.. here is a partial list of boards that you can find ATI on.
Give these great boards a call!

are also expecting to be on quite a few more international BBSs. 

We don't know exactly where ATI is getting to, but these are the places that
we know ATI is getting uploaded regularly to. In the next few weeks I will
attept to compile a more complete list of boards that have ATI issues. And of
course, it goes without saying that if you have ATI issues, please do upload
them to any boards you call! 

Also, we are now offering full sets of ATI issues to anyone who wants them.
Just send us $1.00 to cover postage and give us an address, and we will mail
you a full set of ATI issues for you to enjoy (and upload to your local
boards!). If you already have some issues, then tell us which ones you don't
have (issues 1-46) and we will send you them. The disks can be sent in the
following formats: Commodore, Amiga, IBM MS-DOS, and Atari-ST. All disks are
3 1/2" size, unless you have a Commodore. If you have a Commodore, we can send
you the files on a 3 1/2" disk or 5 1/4" disks. Please do take advantage of
this offer, as we want to get as many people reading ATI as possible. We would
definitely like to hear from any and all BBS sysops that have the space to put
up our issues! (issues 1-46 together make up about 500k)

You can also get ATI issues through Bitnet. Just mail tk0eee1@NIU and you will
be mailed ATI thru the net!

first a poem by ground zero:

    **To Juan**

On a planet
On which life is cheap  
You epitomiz the tragedy
of a single wasted life.

What led to the exit?
Solitude? Fear? Confusion?
I suppose solitude led
to fear and confusion....

If you'd offer'd someone a glimpse
of your heart-
Could this end have been
averted?

So what of your lost future?
What of the event of an individual
being pushed
to end his days?
What of the collective?

We have failed.
Miserably.


  ARMAGEDDON ISLE
  TO THE TUNE OF: Gilligin's Isle...
It all started when we tried to smoke
A joint that was too fat.
We smoked it from beginning to end
In 30 seconds flat.
Them buds they crackled 
'n' seeds all popped as
Paper inched across.
I noticed that my head was getting
High as a kite. 
High as a kite.

The thoughts grew few and far between,
the topics were of peace.
If not for the US and our secret wars
The whole world would be free.
The whole world would be free.

So then the others turned to me
And this is what one said.
  We can have peace,
  And Freedom too,
  Equality,
  And justice.

But the movie star
Is a war monger and greedy bastard.
Here on Armageddon Isle.
Here on Raygun's Isle.
Here on Bush's Isle.


TO THE TUNE OF "CHESTNUTS ROASTING"
Flame broiled Whoppers in 
a cardboard box.
French fries sizzling in fat.
Eat them fast or they're soggy and flat
Burger King is where it's at.

You know that Herb is on his way.
And his whole entire ad campaign is gay
Even though, they do it your way,
It still costs too much for  
     steroid sandwiches these days.
                   


        and now,
        a poem
       by prime
War?
Local or far away-
Will it ever go away.
I draw a peace sign in the sand,
A crab bites my toe.
I let him go.
The woe of aftermath--
Can we hang?

ok. here's a couple thingies from issues 1-2-3-4&5 of YIPL (a TAP production)

Hi People,
Here's my bill, send me shit on fuck-
ing the Bell System. Man do I need
info on this kinda shit thanks D.B.,
State College, Pa.

In the office we call it "The System",
and use of the word "the" means dog-
matic finality. The wall comes up 
pretty fast when you start tampering
with the way things are done within The
System, and you either slow down and do things Bell's way or knock your brains
out. --AT&T junior executive, spring 
1967.

U6you consider donating a small 
percent of what YIPL helps you save.

CAUTION: YIPL does not advocate making
free calls. However, YIPL doesnt 
believe in paying for calls, either.
If caught, you may be charged with 
fraud and theft of services. So
consider carefully whether you NEED to
call long distance, and if you do,,
consider whether or not you believe in
FREE SPEECH.

...If you wand to discuss this further, call me up sometime. Because of all the agencies claiming to have me under surveillance, it's one of the fastest ways to speak directly to your government.
Your voice with a smile,
           Abbie Hoffman

BELL EMPLOYEES!!!
If you are a Bell System Employee, you
know well enough just what a skinflint
company you work for. Write us your
documented experiences about working 
for the largest, most powerful piece
of shit in the whole world. If you 
don't work for the phone company but
know someone who does, tell them to
write us.
Other suggestions might be to post
issues of YIPL inside the telephone
building or at key places where
pissed-off workers are likely to see
it.
We want to have specific examples of
sexism, racism, anti-semitism, pigism,
and any other ism you can think of.

When sending in fone bills, or income
tax returns, forgetting to put a stamp
on the envelope won't hold up delivery.
So when you do such things, save (8c).

These were from 1,2, and 3. More of this schtuff later,
prime

PS: try this one: (fly Miami on 1.95!!!) Call someone at a payphone. You must pay the first 2 bucks or so. Keep talking way past the click. When you're done talking, the phone'll ring. Pick it up and listen while the recording says to deposit another 7 bucks. Put in about 2 bucks. Hang up, pick it right up, and hang it up again. The next click you hear should be followed by the return of all your change. Maybe more.

Well, i received a another bill notice in the mail from Litel and along with
it was a little News letter thingy called Pulse..in the letter..has a feature
on Litel going International (Whoopy doo) also some other lame article..but
the article that caught my eye was on Toll Fraud..the article is entitled

                Toll Fraud a 500$ million dollar issue
 

        Last year, the telecommunications industry was defrauded a staggering
$500 million.  "Toll fraud is a serious matter," said Judy Betts, Litel
manager, Fraud Control. "If convicted, perpetrators can face up to 20 years in
prison, confiscation of equipment, and be liable for restitution."
        A primary concern of Litel is to minimize instances of toll fraud on
its network.  In the last two years, Litel had averaged less than two-tenths
of one percent of revenues lost to toll fraud.  "By controlling drains on our
operating efficiency such as fraud, we are better able to keep our rates lower
for our customers," said Tom Byrnes, Litel president and chief operating
officer.
        Judy attributes the company's success to a sophisticated electronic
surveilance system and daily management reports.  "We look for certain signals
and patterns," Judy adds.  "By monitoring switch activity on a real time
basis, we are able to witness the intrusion on our own equipment."
        Litel's system is a strong deterrent to fraud, however, Judy has found
that public relations is her department's greatest weapon. "The media provides
a vehicle for us to educate large groups of people on the implications of toll
fraud," she said.
        Litel's fraud department works closely with all branches of law
enforcement local, state and federal. Recently, Judy's department has been
joining forces with the U.S Secret Service in arresting and prosecuting the
suspects.  Judy's department boasts an 85% conviction rate.
        "We cannot relax our monitoring at any time, though, because the
hackers are always looking for new ways to break our security," Judy stated.
        For Litel's Fraud Control Department, the search continues.

=============================================================================

-------------------------->random comments from ground zero---->

    Those who know me well know my scorn of MTV.. I have always said that it 
overloads the senses and stems creativity. But I do watch MTV from time to
time to see what they're up to. And I discovered a very interesting thing.
They often run a short commercial that they produced themselves pointing out
the dangers of nuclear power and weapons due to the fact that no reliable
method has been found to store plutonium, which lasts over 40,000 years. The
comercial also urges viewers to only elect officials who will stop the nuclear
industry until a safe method of storing plutonium is secured. Well, I'll tell
ya. I was surprised.. 
    MTV may not be so bad after all...
    Speaking of plutnium and energy and all that happy stuff, I have done some
researching articles in the New York Slimes for the past few months and have
come up with some interesting stuff. For one thing, a study of the Energy
Dept. has shown that the agency is run almost 100% by outside contractors,
from major decisions to its smallest administrative functions, to the point
that Energy Dept officials don't have a clue as to what's going on in their
own agency. Another article I found stated that the Energy Dept.'s official
position on cold fusion research is that scientists should not participate in
it because the Energy Dept views cold fusion as impossible to reproduce on a
large-scale level. The Energy Dept maintains this position even though several
experiments in cold fusion have shown to be promising. Now, I would venture to
guess that the reason why the Energy Dept is against cold fusion is because
the dept. is run by outside interests that have huge vested interests in
nuclear power plants that are up and running and were expensive to build.
Imagine if they were obsoleted by cold fusion? Although cold fusion would
clearly benifit mankind by solving the nuclear waste probelem, the Energy
Dept. is discouraging its development.
    Also, the Energy Dept. has been paying the legal fees and fines of
companies contracted by the dept. to run nuclear weapons factories and other
fuctions. As a result, these companies can operate their plants outside of
legal regulations and not be held accountable because the Energy Dept. will
pay all legal expense and all fines incurred due to any violation. A no-lose
situation for them. 
    The Rocky Flats plant in Colorado, the manufacurer of plutonium for
all nuclear weapons is running out of storage space for plutonium waste. It is
currently being stored at the plant site, but the plant's storage facilities
will be full by June if other sites are not found to store plutonium. One
scienific genius thought of WIPP, the Waste Isolation Pilot Project, in which
the waste would be transported to salt flats in Arizona. The waste would be
stored in metal containers and then stored in salt catacombs. The catacombs,
however will fill up with water in the future, and the metal containers
storing the most dangerous waste known to mankind will corrode. Luckily, the 
WIPP project has been put on hold until more studies on its effects are done.
But even more frightening is the idea that ol' King George Bush came up with
for plutonium waste storage. Bush decided that it would be a grand idea to use
US Army bases as "temporary storage sites" for the wastes until sites for
permanant storage have been found. Every area considered for storage, however,
has officials that emphatically declined to take the wastes, with one
exception. The Governor of Colorado offered army bases in Colorado as sites
for storage. 
    The Rocky Flats plant, formerly run by Rockwell International up until
last fall, is currently involved in a court case for violation of enviromental
laws. Even the industry-run Energy Dept. stated that the Rocky Flats plant was
violating almost every Federal environmental law in respect to its operations.
Rockwell Int. has sued the Federal gov't over a waste dispute.
    Now.. we have an Energy Dept. run by outside interests that discourages
development of new technologies, and allows contractors to violate environmenta
l laws by paying their fines and legal fees. And we have elected officials who
want to store nuclear waste in salt catacombs certain to fill with brine, or
just expediently throw them on an army base. There's only one answer to the
question of nuclear power and weapons:
    SHUT DOWN ALL NUCLEAR PLANTS AND STOP PRODUCTION OF ALL NUCLEAR WEAPONS!!
    Here's some other stuff of interest I cam up with:
    DRIGGS, IDAHO- Not even this small farming community is safe from the
onslaught of Yuppies. Driggs, pop. 890, is composed of mostly potato farmers.
But since it is located near a ski resort area, an entrepeneur decided to
start building 880 condominuim units. Residents are opposed to the project
because they fear that it will result in speculation and other situations that
would cause real estate prices to soar to the point that these modest farmers
could not afford it and only rich outsiders could. Conservationists claim the
project would an adverse environmental impact on the area. A Federal district
court blocked the project until an environmental impact study could be done.
    Institutional racism- There are only 6 Black judges in the entire state of
Louisiana. 
    The military is no closer to accepting homosexuals in the service.
    It is estimated that 60% or more of the benefits of the cut in capital
gains tax would go to individuals with incomes of $200,000 or more.

Subj: MORRISSEY

I found this article in SMART magazine. January/february issue. I'll type it
in verbatem. (even though I woulda changed a few thoughts)

the typer takes no responsibility for this review as he just found it a nice
article. He does not necessarily reflect the views of this article.

AND NOW THAT THAT'S OUTA THE WAY...


Swamp Yankee
------------
   BILL MORRISSEY IS a white bluesman
the likes of whom we haven't heard much
from since Hank Williams stopped riding his horse onto the stage of the Grand
Ole Opry. The catch is that Morrissey is a Yankee. But why not a bluesman from
the pockets of lost New England? Havent hollows and flats of squalor always
bred the best blues and country?
Morrissey's first two albums, Bill Morrissey and North, earned him acclaim as
"New England's best-kept secret," but his latest, Standing Eight (Philo/Rounder
 Records), should get him wider notice. In fact, when he howls about feeling
"like the wind hung up on barbed wire," you get the sense they're going to
like him a lot in Texas.

BOMB-MAKING TEEN SENTENCED 
TO A 3-YEAR TERM

ROCKVILLE, Md. (AP)--A teenager who helped run a computer bulletin board
service showing how to make explosive devices was sentenced to three years in
prison for his part in a bombing intended to scare a 17-year old girl.
   David Overeem, 18, Gaithersburg, Md., received the sentence Friday from
Montgomery County Circuit Judge John J Mitchell. The computer service,
"Pyromaniack Production Systems," reportedly gave formulas for homemade bombs
to users as far away as California, prosecutors said.
    Authorities said Overeem was one of the leaders of a group of acquaintances
 who called themselves "Damage Incorporated." Assistant State's attorney
Constance Junghans said in court that the group loaded the bulletin board with
recipes for an array of explosive devices including rockets, car bombs, pipe
bombs, bottle bombs, and land mines.
    Overeem was a junior at Gaithersburg High School at the time of his arrest
in April and was described by prosecutors as "emotionally troubled" and a
young man of superior intelligence.
    Overeem pleaded guilty to making a pipe bomb that allegedly was detonated
by a friend of his on March 26 outside the girl's home in Germantown, which
like Gaithersburg is a distant suburb of Washington, DC. 
    The bombing was intended only to frighten the girl, who was a former
girlfirend of Overeem's friend, prosecutors said.
    No one was injured, but a piece of shrapnel tore through a wall and into a
room where three children were asleep, authorities said.

Now, some thoughts on legalizing marijuana from Bob McKenzie (201):

From: BOB MCKENZIE (#108)
Date: 01/08/90 - 3:14 pm
Subj: (R)drugs

Advantages of Drug Legalization:

The most powerful corporations in the world spend millions of dollars every
year to keep canabis illegal.  Why?  The petrochemical industry doesn't want
legal hemp to compete with synthetic fuel and fiber.  The alcohol and tobacco
industries don't want legal marijuana to compete with cigarettes and beer.
(Tobacco and Alcohol account for over 400,000 deaths per year).  If you were
provided with a non-lethal alternative, which would you choose?

In Amsterdam, Crack/Heroin/Crack abuse dropped over 50% as legal marijuana/hash
 cafe's were set up around the country.  The easy availability of legal pot
curbs the desires to obtain illegal, addictive drugs.

Every year, more people die of Skin Cancer (via tanning salons) (6,000) than
from illegal drugs (3,600).  Ponder that.

Take the money out of this ridiculous war and spend it on the real problems,
treatment for addicts.  1 in 500 are treated for abuse, that means over 499
are turned down for treatment daily.  

Ok, here is why I don't think drugs will be legalized yet.  I think the Law
enforcement agencies are going to want a Breath-Analyzer for marijuana intoxic
ation for driving.  Once that is developed, Pot should be legalized.

For more on these subjects, I recommend "INTOXICATION - Life in the Pursuit of
Artificial Paradise" by Ronald K. Siegel, Ph.D.

Siegel talks about the motivation to acheive altered states of consciousness
is actually "a fourth drive" which is as much a part of the human-animal
condition as hunger, thirst and sex.

Ok I'll leave you with this:

*While growing, hemp produces oxygen and removes carbon dioxide (The
Greenhouse gas) from the atmosphere.*

*10,000 acres of hemp will produces as much paper as 40,000 acres of trees. 
Until 1883, 75%-90% of all the paper in the world was made from hemp*

*Methanol and methane fuel, made from cellulose found in hemp, cornstalks, and
waste paper, can be produced at 10% of the current cost of oil, coal, and
nuclear fuel production.*

*The glucose produced from manufacturing methane would feed 100 percent of all
domestic and farm animals*

*The hemp seed (which contains no THC) is a fruit.  AS a protein source this
seed is second only to the soybean*

(swallow them apples)
Bob McKenzie

GZ's note: Also, a lot less chemicals are needed to make paper fom hemp than
currently used to make paper from wood pulp. With the destruction of our 
environment due to our cutting down the trees that sustain our air supply, it 
makes sense to make paper from hemp again...
