ATI 71. 3-16-97   1041pm

Hello there. Prime Anarchist here. Many really cool things coming up
in issues to follow. But then, of course I'd say that, right? Starting this 
issue I'll reprint (in 5 or 6 episodes) "Marc Frucht's Guide To The 
Unabomber's Manifesto" which was published in Stonington Conn. Dec. 1995.
Yadda yadda! Lemme start with that right after the subscription info. Then
on to the #'s run and the calendars and such. As usual a sub is phree for the
taking. Just send

OK. here goes:
        Part 1 of a 5 or 6 page doc entitled (hey!!! be glad i didn't call
        it a trilogy and go 9 books.):

-------------------------------------------------              
MARC FRUCHT'S GUIDE TO THE UNABOMBER'S MANIFESTO.
-------------------------------------------------
                                   stonington, ct. dec. '95

        If I had to pick a few thousand words to print in the paper and
assure the reading public that this is basically what the unabomber people
are saying in their manifesto they would be what follows: (you will notice
that hardly any of them match what the Washington Post chose to include.
But I've put three dots everywhere I've cut, and have kept in the paragraph
#'s so you can look this all up if you can. See for yourself. The only 
reason I'm trying to put my two scheckels in here, is I believe you are 
being lied to, abused and there, hurt. The "few-thousand-words-they-need-
to-know" were published August 2, 1995. The "full unedited uncensored"
version was not published until 3 months later. Never mind the fact that
I believe there's some footnotes missing, and possibly some entire lines and
paragraphs, I think the time delay was unfair enough. Someone has decided 
what you need to know, when you need to know it, and I believe with all my
heart that this is wrong. By way of reopening government, or at least seeking
real forum, here are the words I think were more important than the others.
I'll highlight those that match the August publication, and I've begun and
ended with short poems of my own, as I've always believed that metaphor is
much more effective, important, and useful along with rhetoric and 
propaganda.

TO THE TECHNOCRAT a peom by marc frucht. Dec. 23, 1995
     I
So what will YOUR bones bemoan
When paleopeople pluck them back up from the craggy earth--
Your youngers entruseted them to til time imemo-real?
Eczema, mine cry that'll be all, pray,
'cept maybe vegetarian: all but the first quarter century.
Walked a lot maybe. Ran too much-- too many 10K's too much pasta.
Will they know about my sex life? How about drug use?
Abuse for that matter-- those silly teen-time years. 
Caffeine-- my only real addiction I fear, 'cept if you count food in general.
I'll leave this mark if I can: before during or after I pass
(maybe I already did) "BEWARE," my humerus'll read, like a strange
Egyptio-hyro-glypho curse. "If you roll me (or any of mine other mariners
For that matter) I will rock you."

Marco said that. Try for double or nothing?

      II
Roll the bones, my anthrofools.
Turn the stones-- use obtrusive tools,
Pluck up trees and leave a mess:
You'll get yours' - ye, sevenfold or less.

1. The Industrial Revolution and its consequences have been a disaster for
the human race...
4. We therefore advocate a revolution against the industrial system. This 
revolution may or may not make use of violence; it may be sudden or it may
be a relatively gradual process spanning a few decades...
50. The conservatives are fools: they whine about the decay of traditional
values, yet they enthusiastically support technological progress and economic
growth. Apparently it never occurs to them that you can't make rapid drastic
changes in the technology and the economy of a society without causing 
rapid changes in all other aspects of the society as well, and that such
rapid changes inevitably break down traditional values.

May 13, 1985 MOVE got bombed.

HATE LETTERS & LOVE MAIL 
Keep the ati's coming!
It's the most worthwhile mail I get!

Thanks for this link! I am adding it to the Homes Not Jails Boston

hey, why not add it to your next newsletter?
Fight the power,

  (ed. note: you got it.)

Ona move! This is a SERIOUS CALL TO ARMS to MOVE's supporters, to all 
revolutionary minded folks EVERYWHERE, and to EVERYBODY who is concerned
about justice.
   May 13, 1997 marks twelve years since the brutal vicious bombing and 
murder of innocent babies, women, men and animals. Little has been done to
really address the root of what caused the police attack on MOVE.
This May 13, we are NOT having another TALK SESSION, nor another PROGRAM,
we're having a work session. This year we're calling on serious-minded
people to work with us to set an agenda, then fulfill it. We need you to tell
us what re-sources you can offer - organizational and individual. We of
MOVE will tell you specific things we think that are necessary. 
   Be serious, be strong, be ready to work!!!

And now, an ATI recommended BOOK OF THE WEEK.
"The Complete Laptop Computer"
    -- David H Rothmann
    Forward by William F. Buckley, JR.
Swear to God. I read at least 3 pages of this one. And 2 were NOT Buckley's.

McBOEING MARRIAGE. Reprinted from THE CATHOLIC WORKER,  Jan/Feb '97. pg 5
        To the tune of 13.3 billion dollars, Boeing and McDonnell-Douglas
got married, pundits calling it a great match, and the couple seem very 
happy indeed. As Sally Marx pointed out the cold war is supposed to be over,
and still more than 50% of US tax dollars go for war preparations. These
monies for organized violence, in some form or fashion, are collected by the
IRS, which, believe it or not, has a "mission statement!" Now, maybe others
don't find this funny, but I associate mission statements with religious 
groups, although I know everybody and their dog seems to have one these days.
In case you missed it, here it is:
        THE PURPOSE OF THE IRS IS TO COLLECT THE PROPER AMOUNT OF TAX
        REVENUE AT THE LEAST COST; SERVE THE PUBLIC BY CONTINUALLY IMPROVING
        THE QUALITY OF OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES; AND PERFORM IN A MANNER
        WARRANTING THE HIGHEST DEGREE OF PUBLIC CONFIDENCE IN OUR INTEGRITY,
        EFFICIENCY AND FAIRNESS.
                --pub. 594, Understanding the Collection Process.

Now we end with JOURNAL POEM 2

I feel misplaced;
My rock used to be in the bank.
Now it's washed down the river,
Maybe at the bottom of the sea by now;
Or maybe on top of some mountain.

Whatever happened to John DeLorean? 
That aluminum car - so costly. Maybe he
Rusted, or washed into some sea.
Of obscurity. Or invested.
In fossil fuel.

A miner's head-lamp, laptop and a 
Portable computerprinter -- never mind
Walderness Pond; I'll go write in a 
Cave. Live on roots.
You mean French onion soup's not
Vegetarian?? Cheez whiz, gadzookamaluga.
Prefix: Gad. Suffix: Uga. Root: zookamal.

Do you remember cruisin' Main Street?
Smaller towns still do it.
Is this the 40's again: or what?
They probably wear sharks tooths too.
And fossils.

With dry sense of humor; who needs a towel?

Gadzookamaluga-
Webster 1958. pg 569.
(n)  ((bad expression. from early bourgeois,
Gadfly- annoying. from caveman, ugh- dunno.
Middle american for doggeral, bad poetry.)) 
Someone who can't express himself well. 
"What a gadzookamaluga." Clinically a 
Writer's block. "I'm gadzookamaluga'd
Now, go easy on me."
Someone's rhetoric simply stinks.
"Gadzookamaluga!"
Great synonym for "Bullshit."

"Dolapachont" is Navajo for "bullshit."
I used to know it in Laguna too.
