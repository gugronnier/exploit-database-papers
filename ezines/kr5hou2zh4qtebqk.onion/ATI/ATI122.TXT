10/14 I'm up at Woolworth's lunch counter, Pueblo, Colo. Boy there aren't
many of *these* left in the world, eh?
The prices have come way up, but I guess it's all relative to everything
else in this world, eh?

Panama Note. 10-17-89. "...then in bkfst this stupid soldier's tellin'
this mess cook he wants his egg well-done. That's between medium and 
hard, he tells him like he's s'posed to know. He argues for 7 minutes 
and 30 seconds, before someone says forget it, "you're getting a medium
egg-- move on soldier," What a day.
1400 aftershocks later, the World Series gets cancelled. And 270 are
counted dead. Have a San Francisco Day.

Barbie Doll 
A poem by Jennifer Halbert 1992.
I wish I was a Barbie Doll.
Blonde hair, blue eyes, that wonderful plastic sheen.
Because if I were only a Barbie Doll
I could be anything:
        Miss America
        an astronaut
        in a beer commercial.
But I'm not Miss America or an astronaut or in a beer commercial,
and I'm definitely not a Barbie Doll.
I'm an American, white, teenage female
with small breasts and body hair
and hopes and dreams that will never be met.
I will not be Miss America or in a beer commercial because they
don't think that I'm feminine enough,
Although this same "they" considers aerospace not a woman's field.
Being an American, white, teenage female, I am tempted to accept
this as life,
        fate,
        just the way it is.
Instead, I summon up all the courage I have to believe that 
this same "they" made the Barbie Doll, and then go into something 
besides aerospace.

PAO, PAO, PAO, KABAM.
This Prime Anarchist Opinion brought to you by Meuselix.
Breakfast of Crampions.

What would you, could you, should you do with a million dollars.
   Did I hear right that Clinton's budget includes upping Peace
Corps' annual expenses from 230M to 270M? Are we really upping past
half a million dollars a year per citizen?  Do some math. No better,
just figure in your head. Get good at that. For every person living
on an income of 10,000 a year there must be a person or five pulling in
a few hundred million in order for THAT dollar amount to move!!!
   I guess my rhetorical question here is (not to knock a fine org
like peace corps but) if instead we gave each citizen even a mere 
quarter million dollars a year for the next 4 years, how many people
would opt to leave the job market, manage about half their assets, and
blow the rest travelling the world on their own and perhaps even better
representing their homeland while abroad?
   Hand *me* a couple hundred K, America. I'll handle my part of a personal
overseas peace mission in such a way that Chris Dodd's hopes of the Corps
growing without becoming "too beurocratized" will surely realize.
   How about our surplus of average guitarists wandering around the 
world teaching blues, jazz, and country? You know, it's not just for
Lee Atwater anymore. And wider, it's certainly not just for Republicans
anymore, Mr. Rowland. Oh sorry, your governorness.

MOOR OH PINION? U WAN MOOR OH PINION? EYE GIB U MOOR OH PINION...
Hello, Oh, you're all too kind. Thankyouthankyouthankyou. I'm your
host, Prime Anchor Mist, and welcome to "This Is Your Life, Submarine."
   Remember the time when you collided with a ballistic tactical fast
attack and nearly killed a whole bunch? No one was killed but there were
titanium, berylium and aluminum scrapings EVERYWHERE.
   Remember when you dragged a 2-ton channel buouy from Long Island sound
half way up the estuary leaving it behind somewhere between the Hess dock
and General Dynamic's launchpads? Oh, it was a cloudy day, and we each 
could've used that buouy so as to not ram ferries, but we had to just do
the best we could.
   Remember back when someone stole you and you got all the way into the
Atlantic Ocean before your rear admiral (or was that the naval admiral??) 
realized you were missing?
   Oh submarine, ever since Leonardo Di Caprio, I mean Da Vinci thunk you up
you've been rambunctious, unpredictable, wild and full of wonder. Oh and 
unction too. Or. Or, was that sea men?
   Maybe we shouldn't have put you in water after all. Would you have been
better off a helicopter? (never mind, remember those skiers?)
Or maybe you're not clutzy at all. Maybe it's your riders' faults.
Of course half a million soldiers and sailors can't be wrong, can they?
   Can they?
   Can they. 
   Maybe one of the only national secrets worth keeping classified for ANY 10
years at a time is that those humans tasked with protecting our freedom "back here at
home" suffer an incompetence that GOES ALL THE WAY UP.

Egge's Great Music. A Review by Gary R.

My attitude towards Austin's collective musical taste has vastly 
improved since Ana Egge was voted a couple of awards.  She's probably 
the most underrated performer in Austin or the world right now.
    She's reinventing traditional American folk music like was done on 
old albums like American Beauty, Nashville Skyline Rag and The Band.
It's been a long time to hear somebody have so many great tunes on 
one album with such sweet artistry. There's a lot of hot artists with 
one or two hit songs but the rest of their CD effort is lame.
    I hope she continues on the steep learning curve musically (lot of 
work and time) that she obviously went through during her teens. One 
of the things the sixties proved is that you don't have to compromise 
your talent or enter into some bad deal with a major label to make a 
good living playing music if you've got the special talent that 
crosses the thin blue line beyond.  I think she's got it - not many 
people do.

More Pears Of D's:
Marsha Jan
to the tune of I Woke Up In Love This Morning.
As performed by the Partridge School. I mean Family.
Or was that Clan?

Last nite I turned out the light, 
lay down and thought about you,
I thought about the way that it could be.
Two O'clock wondrin' what I'm doin' here alone without you.
So I close my eyes and dream you here to me.
And,
I woke up with Jan this morning,
I woke up with Jan this morning
went to sleep with Marsha on my mind.

THE 5-POUND STEAK to the tune of
The Impossible Dream
If you eat the 5-pound steak,
you will eat, eat it all free of charge.
You will be, the hit of all amarillo.
If you eat, the 5-pound steak.

I had an 80 oz steak the other night
I ate an 80 oz and my face turned bright white.
I had a coronary I had a coronary.
The doctor checked me out and now I'm alright.

(ch)

I ate an armadillo steak just last night
It was a roadkill armadillo layin' upright.
He'd had a coronary, or maybe 'twas a car-onary.
I ate a 5 pound armadillo under the streetlite.

Our last for the week. To Whim O Wheh, (the lion sleeps tonite)
by MF
In the diction-ary, there's a word for so carefree.
In the book, yeah, the mighty book
Yeah, a word that means carefree.

Whimsical, whimsical.
Whimsical, whimsical.
Whimsical, whimsical.
Whimsical.
(repeat chorus)

Hush there guy and don't ask why
Just be care-free like, me.
Apple pie and oh my, the sky
And be carefree, ee ee ee.

Whimsical...

   another poem by Jennifer Halbert

She walks 
Through the hall
And the wind blows
And moves the curtains
Which hang from the windows
In the room.

I listen
To her talk
And the sound moves
Like silk
Through the air.

She comes closer
And touches
The spot
Inside and out
Which becomes electric
And triggers me to move.

One Twenty Second ATI was dedicated to Keiko Kobayashi.
Wherever you are this moment, you world traveler. Hello old friend.
May Peace Prevail On Earth. 
Especially our Big Mountain. Oh, and
Hey Noni, Noni hey. Can I call dibs on you and Ana
before you meet her and take her away?
   Put on your socks people. The water's getting high
where we're wading. If El Nino pushes the houses in the mud it's just
Californians who'll frenzy up to the bar; but if the trees go
down we're all doomed.
   And what's with all the Maco sharks and tuna beaching up to die
in all the corn fields?
