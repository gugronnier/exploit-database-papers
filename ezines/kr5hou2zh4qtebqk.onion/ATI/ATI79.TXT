NOTAS PRIMAROS.
Hello there. Welcome to ATI79. There will be no numbers run and no calendula
section. No one mailed any #'s in this week. 
This may also be a fairly short issue. It's just starting to sink in I
don't have any studying I have to do. So I can start doing the studying I
pheel like doing. Neat, huh? OK, here goes nothing. Hoka Hey, Nada...
Oye Como Va...

PRIME ANARCHIST'S TAKE ON PAUL MCCARTNEY'S TOWN MEETING ON VH1. 
to the tune of the impromptu song Paul Played at the end. C and F are the 
chords for any interested.
Paul has lots of money 
And now he needs some more.
He's talkin' up his humble pie
And they put him on the TV.

(chorus-1) C'mon back, c'mon back.
Back to the Bishops Gate.
"  "       "   "

Don't get me wrong I like you Paul
Couldn't happen to a nicer guy.
Brittany passed her a tax windfall
And now you gotta "pie" and "pie."

(c-2) C'mon back, c'mon back.
Pay your taxes at the Bishops gate.
"  "      "   "

Andrew sold a couple bottles of wine
And the Queen bought up some more land.
C'mon Paul, you're tryin' too hard;
When it's so easy to understand.

(second chorus)

When you got too much money
You think you don't have enough.
You get so far back you're in front of you;
And they put it on the TV...

(c-1)

----------
OK. We know all about crack babies and so with fetal alcohol syndrome
We're beginning to get the results for what goes on with grandchildren
of bodybuilders who used steroids.
   When on earth will we know how safe or dangerous it is to carry a baby
to term while wearing the Nicorette patch???? Before it's too late? 
Hope and pray!!!


(ed note: hands down ATI's world record shortest editorial to date.)

Kurt Vonnegut was in a panel with Joe Heller and William Styron. I caught it
on CSpan tonite. (Ooh, one more quick sub-editorial. I couldn't help myself.
MSNBC. The only big change you will see to NBC's programming now that 
macrosofty is part owner, is the following: rule number 1. Guests on David
Letterman are no longer allowed to make fun of Bill Gates' toupe.)
   So Kurt Vonnegut's lecture was about Buerocracy in War. Asked what book
he hopes would outlive him he picked Cat's Cradle, surprisingly. Not 
Slaughterhouse Five. Neat. OK. Here's the main thing I wanted to grab from
that talk. He recommended the following two books as our "must reads". Us
being the viewing public... "Candide," by Voltaire. And "Midnite in the
Garden of Good and Evil." Happy perusing...

PART 8 OF MARCO'S GUIDE TO THE UNABOMBER'S MANIFESTO.
169...it is not all certain that survival of the system will lead to less
suffering than breakdown of the system would. The system has already
caused, and is continuing to cause, immense suffering all over the world.
Ancient cultures, that for hundreds of years gave people a satisfactory 
relationship with each other and with their environment, have been
shattered by contact with industrial society, and the result has been a
whole catalogue of economic, environmental, social and psychological
problems. One of the effects of the intrusion of industrial society has
been that over much of the world traditional controls on population have 
been thrown out of balance. Hence, the population explosion, with all that
that implies... and as nuclear proliferation has shown, new technology
cannot be kept out of the hands of dictators and irresponsible Third 
World nations. Would you like to speculate about what Iraq or North Korea
will do with genetic engineering?
170...technology has gotten the human race into a fix from which there is
not likely to be any easy escape.
180. The technophiles are taking us all on an utterly reckless ride into the
unknown. Many people understand somethikng of what technological progress
is doing to us yet take a passive attitude toward it because they think
it is inevitable. But we (FC) don't think it is inevitable. We
think it can be stopped, and we give here some indications of how to go
about stopping it.
180...an ideology, in order to gain enthusiastic support, must have a
positive ideal as well as a negative one; it must be FOR something as well
as AGAINST something. The positive ideal that we propose is nature. That is,
WILD nature: those aspects of the functioning of the Earth and its living
things that are independent of human management and free of human 
interference and control. And with wild nature we include human nature, by
which we mean those aspects of the functioning of the human individual 
that are not subject to regulation by organized society but are products of
chance, or free will, or God (depending on your religious or philosophical
opinions.)

JOURNAL POME 9

Colorado Ave. drinkin tea
Tasting of a rusty old sewer
Sitting on Sitting Thinking Stone
Thinking of places never been to.
Strongest coffee north of Santa Fe.
Bike lock cable wedged into spokes
Like steel spaghetti: thief runs off
Into daylight yonder. Rage, I think
About, letting go -- unravelling
Bike lock. Tightening spokes to
Hand-true. A ruined cable, I ponder
Too- a saved mountain bike.
Haiku: Cap'n Crunch, walnuts,
       Gatorade and elephant
       Peanuts. Yummy. Huh?

Take a load off your mind-- your
Cerebral cortex, corpus collosum,
Cranial cavity. Your canoggin.
"They're not bald spots," says
Zac Taylor. "It's worry skin."
What a yutz.

Lady with bouffant falls like President Ford
Off a piper plane-- cologne smelling like
It cost more than my college education.
What a clutz.

Rock star tries to "pick up chick." Spandex
Shirt, leather pants, 5'4" with 5-inch heels.
You know me? I'm with that band. I'm the 
Light man, take my hand. He looks down
Her 10-year-old cleavage-less concert t-shirt.
What a putz.

Army wife tries to pick me up. Spandex shirt,
Leather skirt. 5 foot 2 blond hair with roots.
I know you. I sat at the corner with Mai Tais.
You dance real good, she says. I wasn't even
In whatever bar she's cornered. Who she thinks
I am I wondered. I look down her arm at her ring
Finger, glittering shimmeringly. Sorry, I say.
I don't date sluts.

And Sleeping Buffalo lays pensively,
Vigilant; brown and gray with white
Splotches marbled in. Hills can make
You forget what ocean would look like.
Mountains drive me nuts.

Tha-tha-tha-that's all f-f-f-folks.

ATI 79 it was. This was Monday, Memory Day 1997. Hope you had a good
Parade. And you got no reign.
