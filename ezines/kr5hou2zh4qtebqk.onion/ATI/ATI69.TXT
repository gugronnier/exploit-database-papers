I will not subscribe to your magazine until you pull tobacco 
advertising.
Thank You.
Chad.
    (we don't advertise tobacco, so we forwarded your kind 
      words to 42 companies who do.)

Marc,
You've triggered many nostalgic images in my mind. I'm a child
of the 60s, and with each passing year I value more highly those
marvelous years of free thought and its consequent dissent against
the ruling elite who devastate generation after generation with 
their wars and their overall insane domination.
The 60s was a time when the light of human dignity flared for
a brief time. Now our young people have been dumbed down and
molded into zombies. But the light of hope is never extinguished.

Yeah, it reads fine. I like the toll free numbers at the top. fight the
power, Chris

GROUP OF SEVEN: Strange Coincidence or Regrouping of Instant Axis -- 
Just Add Estados-Unidos.
              by marco capeli
    Is G-7 a new "Pact of Steel" or am I imagining it?
    Let's see, consider the fact that Japan, Germany, Italy and the US all share
G-7 along with France, Canada and "Great" Britain. I'll hold back suggesting
the US will forever go wherever France "requests," til death do us part.
DATELINE-- WWII. Japan signed the aforementioned treaty with Italia y Alemania.
Hungary, Rumania, Slovakia, Bulgaria AND Croatia joined in with the "pact of steel"
nearly right away, making the hub of the "axis." Busy spokes those hubs.
    Finland and Spain TRIED to stay neutral until Russia opposed the "AXIS" when 
in true knee jerk fashion they signed on for "loose affiliation" with "pact of steel."
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
ETYMOLOGO-HUNT             I wonder if Pact-Of-Steel, Axis, and Group-Of-Seven come
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .       from any too-similar roots???
