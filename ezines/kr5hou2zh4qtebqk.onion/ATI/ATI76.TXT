Romper Stomper bomper boo,
Tell me tell me, tell me do.
Magic mirror, tell me today,
Did all my friends have fun at play?
I see Newt, and Jesse; Tipper and Elizabeth;
George and Manuel; Oliver and Ronald;
Colin and Norman, Colin! Get your hands off Newt's you
know what. I've told you once, and I've told you a 
thousand times. This country, and especially TV land
simply cannot handle inter-racial, gay relationships.
   Shame on you, Now walk on that Lego balance beam, 
sponsored by Hasbro, Proctor and Gamble, and Monsanto
corp. Colin, walk from one end to the other with your
pants down. We're each going to take turns spanking your
dark little heiney.
   Des Moines, Iowa, it's Sunday, April 27, 1997 and this is
ATI, (Activist Tupperware, Incorporated) Issue #76.
1776? 1976? Que revolutionario, mi publicacion tirada es mui  
tirado y frescura, novedad. 76. 76. 76. 76.
   OK. So the romper room lady is dead. Long live the romper room
lady. Yeah. Miss Nancy Claster died of cancer the other day at 82. 
Remember her magic mirror?
I see Anais Nin, and Gore Vidal, George Plimpton and Martha? 
Mariel? Margot? Is that you? What are you all doing in that hot-tub?
   Holy Apropos!
   Eugene Stoner, 74, Designer of the M-16 (did you say Hasbro???) picked
the same day to die?? And the NY Times, schmaltzo schlock-mongers that
they are, put his picture right next to Miss Nancy's!!!
   I see Mattel, Hasbro, Colt, Smith & Wesson...
   I remember my first M-16 vividly. #59209-3a. because it had Hasbro 
hand guards. Not a whole Hasbro like others I've had, the chamber and
trigger mech. was made by Colt in my home state of CT. 
   In fact two buildings down from the Regency apartments in Bridgeport
where my grampa was a super. How was I to know when I was playing Tonka
trucks, GI Joes, watching Romper Room and Mr. Rogers I would grow up to
score expert on M-16, AK-47 AND the Afghani 5-shot sniper rifle? Only
sharpshooter on grenade though, so keep me away from the white phosphorus.
   How was I to know I'd Miss Gulf War Syndrome by one digit on my ss#?
How was I to know I'd become a conscientious objector AFTER receiving an 
Honorable Discharge. How was I to know I would become an LSD fiend while
on active duty (it's more "normal" than you'd think) only to quit cold
turkey (no patches, hypnotists or 1-900#'s for me, pal) the minute my
End-Terminate-Service was filed?
   Thank you Hasbro, you make me want to puke. Thank you Miss Nancy. You
showed me how to see magic. You can never know. Thank you Eugene Stoner,
for inventing such a beautiful well functioning, defense-only (yeah, right.
mommy, what's a tumbler round??) piece of freedom protection.
   I almost want to break my pacifist vow and commit violence on your
casket, Stoner Gene. But your corpse is art, and as quoth Dante: "Violence
to art more heinous be than murder of children, verily."
   The God that made you dead is the same beautiful God who brought us the
New Deal, New World, peace in the mideast, Mother Theresa and Ronny 
Raygun's lovely radio voice.
   Sublime, man.
   Be glad I never had GI Joe and his twins gang-raping Barbie in the back
of a Tonka truck. I saw that in the park the other day and the mom?
Obliviously busy reading the most recent Topaz Danielle Steele Harlequin
Romance novel.
   OK, last week's Topaz Danielle Steele Harlequin Romance novel.

You notice how close "cosmic" and "comic" look? Now, that's divine
comedy. I'm prime anarchist and that, my friends, was my column. A
triple whammy double obituary feature. And now on to the good stuff.
Odzooks. I promise. 

SNL Notes: a Prime Anarchist Production. 
   I finally found someone with more makeup caked on her face than
Tammy Faye Bakker. That gorgeous "chick" in the band No Doubt. Is she
covering up crater face by the pound or what? Oh well. Doesn't 
disillusionment drag you down?
   Is GE Smith sick? Dead? Retired? I didn't see the reputedly under-
rated stage-hog guitarist the whole show. Heard a rumor he can't get along
with Martin Short. Oh Prima Donnie...
   At any rate -- if the guy's gone I'll start watching SNL regularly
again for the first time since John Belushi straddled a toilet and
speed balled his brains out. Dude, that hit me hard too. Curt Cobain's got
nothing on you. 
   ADBUSTERS MOMENT!!!  Attention please: The Purpose Of Saturday Nite
Live Is To Sell $30,000 Automobiles. 
   By the way, I really like No Doubt a lot. Attn: Dave Fischer. Is the
lead singer your ex-girlfriend, Vanessa???
   Cars.
   One more car ad after this Gatorade commercial and they lose me.
   Going, going. Gone.

Subject: Personal Message for Richard A. Leo, Ph.D., J.D.
Dear Professor Leo,
Greetings from Swiss exile!
Someone forwarded to me a message that you posted entitled "False 
Confessions", in which you stated you are "collecting information on, and 
systematically documenting, cases involved police-induced false 
confessions (police-induced false confessions) that have occurred in the 
United States in the last 30 years". I am responding to you at my 
earliest convenience.
What I find, (and I believe you would be in agreement with me on this), 
even more unacceptable and distasteful than for police to obtain 
confessions through the use of threats, torture, blackmail, and all the 
other barbaric tools of their trade...is for prosecutors to obtain guilty 
pleas through similar methods, including the hanging of a symbolic axe 
above the head of a terrified accused: a lengthy prison sentence.
I can help you quite a lot. I am a rarity. I survived what no one ever 
survives and is willing and able to tell about it. I survived Hell...Hell 
which was viciously imposed upon me under colour of law. 
If you do not already know who I am, you will be surprised to learn that 
my story begins right in your neighbourhood, right there in Boulder, 
Colorado.
For now, please allow me to list just a handful of some of the crimes 
which have been perpetrated against me by the US government under colour 
of "law":
1. Thirty-eight (count 'em!) agents of the FBI (America's Gestapo) broke 
down the door of my peaceful Colorado home on 18. March 1988.
2. These American Storm Troopers immediately shot my small daughter's 
8-week-old puppy in the head directly in her presence, killing him 
instantly. My daughter, then two-years-old, had never been allowed to 
witness any act of violence, and had never seen a weapon of any kind.
3. These cowards then handcuffed my hands tightly behind my back, 
waist-chained me, shackled my legs, and then beat me up so badly that 
after I finally healed, no one I knew was able to recognise me again. I 
don't even recognise myself.
4. After these "jack-booted thugs with badges" (to quote prominent 
Harvard attorney Alan Dershowitz) had beaten me to a pulp, they then 
stripped my wife (6 months pregnant at the time) and TWO-YEAR-OLD 
DAUGHTER naked, and performed full body cavity searches on them.
5. America's Finest then (without the benefit of any warrants or 
indictments) seized virtually everything my family and I had worked a 
lifetime to accumulate, and threw my naked pregnant wife and horrified 
TWO-YEAR-OLD daughter out into a blizzard, at 10:00 pm at night, left to 
die. Thankfully, they were rescued just in time, although they did nearly 
die of pneumonia.
6. These protectors of America then proceeded to kidnap me, take me on a 
"tour" of the barbaric US prison system, and then torture me for two 
years in such places as MCC-Chicago ("The Warehouse of Death") and Marion 
- the worst prison in the world. Lacking the required crime to hold me, 
they eventually charged me with "...presiding over a corporation which 
was behind in paying some computer paper bills." They twisted this into 
"fraud". The public "defender" I was forced to accept (who never filed a 
single motion for me) eventually coerced me into pleading guilty to this 
"crime" by falsely informing me that my infant daughter, whom I had never 
seen, was dying of spinal meningitis in a Georgia hospital, and the only 
way I would be allowed to visit her on her death bed wold be if I pleaded 
guilty. Within an hour of entering the coerced plea, I discovered I had 
been lied to and tricked and immediately attempted to withdraw my coerced 
plea. I have been trying ever since. My demands have fallen on deaf ears.
7. When I was finally released two years later, the FBI convinced my wife 
to commit perjury and obtain an illegal "quickie" divorce in the Rome, 
Georgia Superior Court, as I was pulling into town on a Greyhound Bus, 
just in time to spend Thanksgiving with my family, with whom I had waited 
two long years to reunite. Immediately upon my arrival in Rome, I was put 
on the next bus out to San Diego, California.
8. For eighteen months, I was forbidden from leaving San Diego County. 
There was a lot of action, though. The FBI and their "assets" terrorised 
me, and attempted to assassinate me several times - once with a large 
number of witnesses, at Seaport Village, one of the biggest, most public 
tourist traps in California, literally right across the street from the 
downtown San Diego business district.
9. After multiple assassination attempts failed, I was sent into exile 
here in Switzerland on 12. June 1991, where I've remained ever since, 
defending my own cases against the FBI and the US government in various 
corrupt US courts. To this date, I've written over 10,000 letters, 
seeking legal assistance from America. Not one attorney has helped me. 
They're all too terrorised of the FBI and other American secret police 
agencies. As Thomas Jefferson wrote in the Declaration of Independence:
"When people fear the government, you have tyranny.  When government 
fears the people, you have liberty."
Clearly, today, perhaps more than at any other time in American history, 
the people fear the government. I wager to say that the people are, in 
fact, TERRIFED of the government. Actually, one could argue that there IS 
no government; that America is now an occupied nation, occupied by 
criminals and secret police, with their careers fueled by the seemingly 
infinite coffers of drug lords.
10. Forced to represent myself in the federal courts in an attempt to at 
least have my illegally-seized property returned to me, the judges, 
mostly close friends with George Bush, have consistently, categorically, 
violated all of my rights - most notably, my right to Due Process of Law. 
To date, there has never been a proper hearing on the illegal seizure of 
all of my signifacant property, and the courts have refused to appoint 
counsel to represent me. In stark contrast, the US government is going to 
pay Timothy McVeigh's legal team, led by Stephen Jones, in the same court 
my case is in, in Denver, up to $30,000,000 for his defence!
All of the above - and so much more - has been done to me because I 
resurrected Senator Gary Hart's 1988 presidential campaign, and attempted 
to inform the American people who George Bush really is: the world's 
biggest drug dealer, who is linked to the assassination of President John 
F. Kennedy...a former CIA director whose father, Prescott, personally 
financed the political career of Adolf Hitler and the Nazis' rise to 
power in Germany. 
To get a better idea of what I've been enduring at the hands of the US 
government for the past decade, please visit my web page, which is at:
http://www.kmf.org/williams/
While you're there, you owe it to yourself to take advantage of the 
opportunity to download the forbidden George Bush unauthorised biography. 
If you choose to download it, and I sincerely hope you do, please begin 
reading the chapter entitled "The Hitler Project", so you can see for 
yourself how George Bush's father, Senator Prescott Bush, personally 
financed the political career of Adolf Hitler, and the Nazis' rise to 
power. 
I can send you quite a lot of documents to support all of the above and 
so much more. Some of these documents, I can send to you as e-mail 
attachments. First, I must know if you can read documents created with 
Microsoft Word 6.0.1, and also, which method of encoding I would have to 
use on my Power Mac to send the attachments to you: BinHex, Base 53, 
Uuencode, or what.
If you will provide me with a postal (i.e., "snail-mail") address, I can 
also send you copies of documents and audio tapes which I cannot send you 
via any other means.
As I write, my latest appeal, pertaining to the unlawful forfeiture of my 
entire estate, is pending in the US Court of Appeals for the Tenth 
Circuit, right there in Denver, just a few minutes' drive from the Pearl 
Street Mall. I have no attorney. I am not an attorney. The US government 
would like nothing better than to deny my appeal, due to my inability to 
properly defend it. I borrowed several thousand dollars to retain Harvard 
attorney Marc A. Pembroke to represent me on this case. He filed a 
watered-down version of the document we had agreed on, then abandoned me 
and the case. As it turns out, he was just another in a long line of FBI 
"assets", sent by the US government to sabotage my case against them. 
If you're willing to help me, I can provide you with scores of documents 
proving my case, although the documents which would land George Bush in a 
federal penitentiary, where he belongs, would need to be (and could 
easily be) subpoenaed if an actual attorney were doing it, and not a 
layman to the law, dying a slow death in distant foreign exile - the 
direct result of two years of the most unspeakable tortures having been 
cruelly inflicted upon him by representatives of a "democratic" 
government. 
If you're not willing to help me, well...let's just say I won't be 
surprised. I've learnt to look for the worst and hope for the best. I 
would still be willing to assist you in your research, although, until 
the American people have the courage to stand up and oust the Beast, 
things will not change; they will simply continue to get worse and worse. 
(Can you even imagine that)?
I will close now and hope to hear from you soon.
In Liberty,
Michael Williams
