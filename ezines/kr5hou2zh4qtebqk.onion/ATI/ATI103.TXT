Hello, I'm prime anarchist and this is my newest ati. How did you like
the disclaimer, did it make you mad? I just about dribbled down my 
shirt and snozzed all over my steering wheel on that one I'll tell you.
It was written by my friend John and he said I could steal it, so 
if you want it you gotta steal it from me; but remember you got it
from a little old lady who was...

Well, the Pentagon is requiring that WJeffersonC brief all his little
American peoploids that they're deploying another 15,000 troops to
the continuing saga of desert shield. (sic)

And of course the two most pressing issues on average peoples' minds
are:
1) Campaing Reform
2) Is Brad Pitt really a Buddhist?
Not necessarily in that order.
We have lots of stuff in store for you this issue. Submissions and
letters to the editor are picking right up. This time of every year,
huh? Maybe I should put out an annual too. Yeah we could call it
the Farm More Almanac. OK. Ye Olde Farm Moore Almanack. Look for 
it on newstands every Hanukah. Write me and tell me how much I 
should charge for something like that, ok?

 I would like to introduce myself, you might have wondered 
who I was, or what relation I had to ATI. Not much actually, 
as a friend of prime anarchist's and as a fellow telecom weirdo, 
I saw and helped edit some of the issues (and lose
a few of them to the magical wonder of the disk god, 
only to be resurected using the help of the disk sector editor 
...Number 9....Number 9.... ).
  I am not politically active, I am not socially active either. 
I proscribe to no particular ideology, philosophy, or religion. 
I simply observe things that I experience and try to understand 
them objectively (or subjectively ,depending on what mood I am in). 
You will be seeing alot of me in upcoming issues.  I
hope to display pros and cons of differant beliefs. I wish to 
warn you though, I have one simple belief.
    1) Its my undying opinion that all
      people can do lots of damage to
      everything, armed with the faith
      that what they are doing is for
      the greater good.
 
 At first I didn't want this job. But in the end Prime 
bribed me, drugged me, and finally convinced me using the help 
of some girls, a goat, and a vat of vanilla pudding.
 If you want to send me questions, drugs, marriage proposals, 
bomb threats or small furry animals by the name of Fred . 
Please send them to address located at front of this file. 
Please include your name (or reasonable facsimile) with any 
question or opinion so I will know who to insult, praise,
or forbid my children from marrying

   where you are right now,
   only much better."

Subject: New book about pirate radio!

Hello!

I see from your E-zine you liked to listen to Radio New York
International when they were broadcasting via WWCR in the 
early 1990's (ATI 88 and 59). Well, Allan Weiner now has
a book out, and I thought you'd like to know about it! 
There's more info on pirate radio at

Dear Marc
RE: ati102.txt
Did you know the house majority leader's name is DICK ARMY?
Thought you could put that in the ATI. He is a republican
of course.

To The Editor Of ATI:
I heard your an expert of sorts as regards antiques.
Do you know what an Alkalol Salt Water Nasal Douche Cup 
is used for? It's plastic but it seems to be from the 
1960's or so. Is it a true antique or a refab?
Thanks,
Alice. 
Baltimore MD.
               (prime notes:  I used one as a teenager.
               It's for real. You fill it up with salt 
               water, and flush each nostril one at a 
               time. Great stuff. Soothes your membranes
               of the mucous kind. (did I spiel that 
               rite?) Great for allergies, and I won't
               go anywheres near what else. Alice. 
               Is this some kind of prank
               or was that a serious question? ;)

ACCESS TO THE AIRWAVES: My Fight For Free Radio
by Allan H. Weiner (As told to Anita Louise McCormick)
-----------------------------------------
        Allan H. Weiner has always believed that the airwaves
are free, and that they rightfully belong to the people. Ever
since his childhood, this gifted radio enthusiast has devoted
his time and energy to the devolopment of free radio broadcasting.
In addition to his "pirate" radio projects, Weiner has 
engineered, worked for, and owned a number of licenced radio and
TV broadcast stations.
        The film "Pump Up The Volume" appeared to be loosely based 
on Weiner's teenage pirate radio adventures, but failed to capture
even a fraction of the dedication and the intensity that this 
heroic free speech advocate has brought to his endeavors throughout
his life.
        The trials and tribulations that Weiner endured to bring
Radio New York International to the air are legendary. The FCC's
illegal seizure of Weiner's radio ship the M/V Sarah in 1987,
which he designed and built to broadcast from the international
waters off the coast of New York, made headlines around the world.
        Weiner's story is both a heart-warming tale of an 
electronics genius at work and a chilling indictment of government
disregard for personal liberties and free speech.
        But despite the FCC's efforts to silence him, Weiner has
persevered. And he continues to work towards a future when the
airwaves are open to all who choose to use them and the world
becomes a better place because of the free transmission of 
knowlege.
        "Access to the Airwaves: My Fight For Free Radio," Weiner's
autobiographical account is a powerful rendition that should
be read by all who believe that speech should be unfettered, and
that fighting the powers-that-be is an often unheralded necessity.
----------------------------------
Weiner's "ACCESS..." is now available from Loompanics Unlimited 
for $17.95 plus $4.95 S&H US (1800-380-2230 usa) 
(1-360-385-7471 intnl)

We and this missivity with Journal pome 31 from Anarchist's
selfpublished book of poetry entitled "I Slurp my Kafee."
JOURNAL POME 31
Blue Moon 1993.
Jogging: a fall, spring
And Summer thing.
Computers are so frustrating.
Lemme quote "argh," from Charlie Brown.
Having bought mushrooms fresh
Right outa manure, my wife and 
I swear no mushrooms anymore.
Smoking sage and tobacco
Keeping allergies at bay.
Awaiting my guitar in the mail.
United Way reminds me
Way too much of Amway.

Freudian schlepp- (v) to go somewhere
Not remembering why you got there.
But staying to find out anyways.
Which full moon do you like best?
Avacados to break your fast.
Almost full? Full full?
Or the waney one??
Canoe-ing        under the       up to the
Mystic river;    drawbridge      seaport.

Hanuman Temple, Taos.
Half Moon, October. 
Navajo tea; looks like
Chinese twig tea.
Tastes though, of lemon-
Grass honey-covered.

Defendant enters courtroom
With bag of sage, Bible
And a notebook. Maybe
The DA has rabies.
