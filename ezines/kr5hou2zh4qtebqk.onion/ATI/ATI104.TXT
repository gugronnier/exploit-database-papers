Iron River

    by Chad Faries

your rednecked, red naked curls of translucent.
That tree trunk's long shadow at sundown deep, 
 a branding iron sizzling at the intersection  
  of water and a hot steel shadow to come.
You voyeur in the night
Your breathing is too heavy,
We know you are there behind that tree, 
 under that forging sun
Your sick with fermented corn
and the dreams of steel.
But at times, your trees
OH are they the flags that
wipe your spittle !
OH are they the good red
mothers that sentence
themselves to Brule, 
 Lac Vieux Desert  
  Smoky Lake, Chicagon,
The good red mothers
spell themselves across the whole
county, saying  
  "That river was a good man once."
  
Your banks are swollen lips.
Punched!
What a shifter you are, red lips and fishnet.
And your fish,
suckers.

In one of his confidential moods, old Eduord Sancavaine, a French
voyager who had arrived in the year 1810 told a writer how he spent a
winter down on the Brule River with a partner and his squaw.  No corn or
wild rice had been stored for the winters freeze.  The Indians were
gone, an occasional supply of beavertails would not be looked for.  The
traders only resource was fish, found in the shallow Brule.  These must
be secured before they migrated, for the ice in the stream would freeze
to the bottom.  During the mild seasons small suckers from four to six
inches long found a home in the Brule. These were secured by nets.  The
fish were packed in long troughs hewn out of solid logs.  But it was not
a good year for fish and winter came early. 

 Nothing but gloomy lifeless forest all around and stretching far away!

  Only small frozen suckers! 
 
 No hunters with juicy porcupines or fat beaver to replace the larder!

"I begin starve.  I think of nothing but fish, fish all the time.  All
nite I dream about him. I wake up and Oh my stomac'feel so bad! I go
crazze. I say, I moost have some of them suckers or I die. I steal sly
into that room where Frenchman and squaw sleep and keep fish so I can
get him.  I crawl to trough, tear out fish and eat him raw.  The trader
he see me.  We make fight.  I try kill him, but hees squaw she help him;
so I was whip bad.  But that trader, I s'pse he afraid I go crazze, in
morning he let me have plenty sookers. Den I get better. But we were
most like dead mens when spring come."

 You are defiant of scientific law.
  A tinderbox submerged in water.   
   A stretched entrail with brothers that map the county. 

OH Paint River at the center. My first eagle there while I bathed  
 in the river with my cousin.         
        Dere! Dere! A Eagle! A perfect omen in the tincture of fall.
A brush stroke 
 OH Brule River to the South with your Ojibwa.  
  Your sucker fish.
  
You non-gendered trickster. Eduord Sancavaine still starving lost in a
limited edition Iron County History.  And that "squaw", that ignorant
derogatory discourse. Her smooth high forehead, square shoulders, flat
bottom forgotten, still ricing 180 years later, still forgotten,
offspring now number some 200 mixbloods, 
forgotten mother ricing near Brule to the South.  
The metronomic thrashing of a ricing stick.  
The subtle downpours of rice falling on the bottom of the canoe.             
         No ideas but in notes. No form but in tincture.             
         Welcome the rust colored men that drink river water. 
   Praise for industry. Praise for what will be estranged   
   children running naked toward abandoned mining pits,   
   Jumping in and fogetting years as they back stroke      
   
   and squint at a spectrum of white light.



FLASH
///// BILL CLINTON DECLARES SPAM ON SADDAM HUSSEIN
        A midnite shift in strategy has occurred: there will NOT be a 
Desert Yield and Desert Swarm afterall, and surprisingly the 
multinationals are NOT disappointed.
        "She rolled over to me," said Clinton, (we're not sure at
presstime but can almost confirm he WAS meaning Hillary) "and sleepily
said, 'SPAM the fucker.'"
        That's when it occurred to the nation's CEO that a multi-
billion dollar mailbomb would be even more effective than spending
all this time trying to play cat and mouse with the man's aid 
packages while orchestrating bombing raids, ground wars and all
day drunks around Iraq.
        "Yes," said Clinton, in a slightly toned down official statement,
"we WILL spam the sucker; and he won't know what hit him."
        The Pentagon will not give the date and time stamp away but
said the spamming will begin very soon. After a short period of
what he calls "spam-sorties", tiny little messages sent through
pentium un-filters which multiply each subject header by trillions
per hour he will then allow anyone with a modem of speeds higher than
1200 bps to begin sending usenet messages to the Persian Gulf.
        By the end of the Spamming Hussein should be so engulfed in
e-mail he won't have time to compete with Squibb and Proctor & Gamble
on biological weapons.
        "Why didn't I think of that," said Whitehouse Spokesman and
Official News Correspondant Norman "Cookie Roberts" Schwartzkov.
"Even old baggie-knees-Bush wouldn't have made me take THAT one back.
        He said the multinationals are quite happy because they 
can now make more money sector editing and cleaning out kernals all
around Bosrah and Baghdad for the next five years than they would have
made trying to collect bullets and arrowheads.

                  Re: Damage Reduction

My Dearest Marco,        
It gives me great pain to tell you that they intercepted 
many of our emails, including the hot ones. 
Please destroy all the .jpg's 
of you, me and Johnny Chung doing the nasty.
    I'm more worried honey, about those pictures that display
your finger in my you-know-what and your you-know-what in Mr. Chung's
ear, than I am about even the texts showing Mr. Clinton vetting
with the Chinese. Or even Newt Gingrich vetting his Republican Dairy 
Aire off.
    But Please destroy those as soon as you can, ok?        
And for Yikes-sakes, Marco - stop wearing my panties on
your head during your anti-NAFTA press conferences four 
to eight times a week.        
    They're dragging all of Bill and Hillary's criminal friends
into court today - and tomorrow they want me to discuss all our hot
e-mails. I think they know about the times you and
I did the nasty in the west wing of the Oval Office while we let
all those Chinese tourists take photographs. Any idea if Chelsea
was there with her Sony cam-corder? I think that's the only way
the GOP could've found out.        
This morning Chelsea's going to talk about that time in
LittleRock with you me and her in the bushes when she was 11. Swear
to me Marco, you'll deny it all. You weren't the ONLY one who was
old enough to go to jail for that, I was 21.        
I'm going to testify that Chelsea's a nympho with a humongous
fantasy life in her head and that you and I had nothing to do with it.        Marco, what if they find out you're not an anarchist? What_______________________________________________________________________________Message 12 of 48         Mail from: Brook
   I love you Marco. I love you, you're my honey. Promise me you'll
destroy this email as soon as you've read it. If thy find this
we're absolutely screwed.

   London 19 November 1997
   Unfortunately, this is only one of a number of reports
   concerning the ethic of the music industry, its featured
   artists and the misuse of children.
   Gary Glitter, UK pop / rock star of the 70 / 80s was arrested
   overnight by the UK police. He was later released on bail. Gary 
   was reknown for his numermous come-back and Christmas Concerts
   We use the Really past tense because although in showbiz, he 
   is not someone of the "stature" of Micheal Jackson.
   PC World reported child porn on his PC when it was taken
   in for repair. His house was also searched.                             
   Has the industry "lost it's way?"  

(we got a LOT of letters to the editor this week. Kool.)
and now:
PRIME ANARCHIST WORLD NEWS:
Main Street, USA. (PAWN) - MATTELL PLANS AN M-16 WITH MORE CURVES
AND LESS STEAL.
   By White Knighthawk
   Special to PAWN

LOS ANGELES EAST - A less bulky M-16A2.95 weapon is on the drawing 
boards at Mattel, Inc. in a makover designed to give a more
inclusive profile to the already somewhat voluptuous best selling
gun that used to tick off feminist Pentagon lobbyists while becoming
an icon for gangbangers and soldiers all over the world.
        The M16A2.95, nicknamed "Barbie" by competitor Hasbro, will
include a thicker butt-stock and curvier hand-guards made out
of a new fiberglass/polystyrene/leftover-uranium-tailings mixture
that Mattel claims will be much better than the steel and plastic
mix earlier used by both Mattel and Hasbro.
        "We want to make this so that male and female soldiers alike,
whether they be civilian OR military, can pick one of these up and
feel good about killing another human being," said Mattel president
and CEO William 'Death' Provider.
        "Besides," he said at a Tuesday meeting of tobacco, beer and
toy lobbyists, "all the new curves just feel really good up against
your hand and body."
        The "plastic surgery" is part of a continuing evolution for
the M-16 assault rifle which got a face-lift in 1967 when tumbler
rounds were first introduced which tear enemy flesh and bone into
an unworkable mess of jelly-like substance.     
        That's especially important, says Whitehouse spokesperson,
Larry "Dallas" Hagglerman, if you're hardly ever sure you've killed
"one of them or one of us anymore."
        It also underwent another big change in 1977, said Hagglerman
when hand guards and flash supressors were added for the first time.
Before that, a round spitting out the front end occasionally spit
back a black hot syruppy carbon-like substance that would sometimes 
leave the left hand, well, sticky for a few hours. It made no sense
to the inventors that a gun-firer should get their hands dirty after
rendering an enemy body "icky," according to Provider, so they worked 
18 years until perfecting it.
        Feminists and child advocates are now very satisfied with the
shape and texture of the M16A2.95.
        A subtle change in addition to feminizing the weapon can be
seen on the tumbler round itself. The front end of each round is 
scored ever so slightly in a circular motion with a surgical steel 
tool that slightly resembles a small robotic circumcision device - 
making the bullet even more phallic. This was important to the 
lobbyists as they were trying to please everybody.
        "It's, well," said Dorothy Dalton of the women's chapter of
NOWW, National Organization of Women with Weapons, "Kind of sexy, we
like it."
        Provider claims it just plain pleases everyone.
        "Besides," said Provider, "when converted to an AR-15 it'll
get past that politically correct, liberal, leftist Clinton weapons-
ban a whole lot easier if it looks more like a chick."
