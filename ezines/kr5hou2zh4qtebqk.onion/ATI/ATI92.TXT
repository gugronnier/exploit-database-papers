Hello. Welcome to issue 92 of ATI, Actively Twisted Intelsat.
We'll begin with:

--------------> Random Notes from Ground Zero
		      gr0und0@juno.com

	Hey folks.  2600 Magazine's Beyond Hope was GREAT.  I had a blast 
checking out all the interesting panels, seeing some old friends and 
meeting people. 
   Hopefully I'll have an article in the next issue about it.  
This time, I have a guest contributor, Taxula.

	But first, here's a few jokes to set the mood..

	
**********
JOKE #1:
**********

Bill and Hillary are at the first baseball game of the season. The
umpire walks up to the VIP section and yells something, and suddenly
Clinton grabs Hillary by the collar and throws her over the side and
onto the field.  The stunned umpire shouted, "No, Mr. President! I said,
'Throw the first PITCH!'"

**********
JOKE #2:
**********

Bill and Hillary are at a restaurant. The waiter tells them tonight's
special is chicken almondine and fresh fish.  "The chicken sounds good;
I'll have that," Hillary says.

The waiter nods. "And the vegetable?" he asks.

"Oh, He'll have the fish," Hillary replies.

**********
JOKE #3:
**********

Q. Bill and Hillary are on a sinking boat. Who gets saved?
A. The nation.


	And now, I present.. Taxula!




					   Best  Answer Award
					   ----- ---------- --------

This year's award for the best answer to a whiney liberal question goes to
Ben Beltzer, founder and director of the Interfaith Housing Coalition of
Dallas.  First, some background.

Interfaith is a non-profit organization that helps homeless people get back
on their feet.  The people are given a place to live, clothing, and food.
 They have three months to complete educational programs, find their own
housing, get a job, and save $1,200.  So far, 800 people have graduated
from
the program and an independant study found 2 out of 3 still off the dole
and
off the street two years later.

Interfaith takes no government money for its $690,000 budget because
Beltzer
doesn't like the paperwork or the rules that come with it.  In fact, he
returned $15,000 to the feds because, had he taken it, he would have been
unable to enforce one of his firmest rules: do drugs and you're gone. 
Which
leads us neatly to the whiney liberal question and the answer.

Jay and Connie were a young couple on the program.  Jay was caught using
drugs, twice.  The first time he was warned and sent to rehab, the second
time they had to go. Jay picked up his young daughter and thrust her toward
Beltzer asking the whiney liberal question, "YOU'RE not going to put her on
the streets are you?"

Beltzer looked at him clear eyed and replied, "No, YOU are."

On a happy note, Connie is now clean, working, in her own apartment, and
has
full custody of both their children.  And Jay?  Who the heck cares?

TAXULA (Sucking your wallets dry, not for me, but for the children.)

Thanks, Ground Zero. And now for the Prime Anarchist Productions #'s run.
PAP, as you know is a subsidiary of NOPE and Nope, it's not Sunday. It's
Monday, September 1, 1997. 9am believe it or not. We begin our numbers run
(a short one this week) 
<jumps out of seat looking pissed> - Wait! There's that Royal "we" again.
To hell with that!! No more Royal we, no more Royal we. Long live the 
Royal we. I'm the only one writing this column, so for the rest of this
article, yours truly, Prime Anarchist will refer to himself as "I."
   heheheheh.
   We are not amused.
   OK, why so short? I didn't have a lot of time to hunt stuff down. Why you
might ask. Because "I" have been spending the last 3 days straight (almost
literally) getting the all new ATI web page started. That's right, you
heard it here first. That's right; Angelfire Communications Corporation
decided to sponsor us with a free web page. Go look at it.
http://www.angelfire.com/wi/kokopeli/ATI.html
   Teaching myself HTML is really fun. Carl of Franklinsnet helped with the 
graphics. OK, so here's the #'s run; and then on to news and stuff.

also alphebetized the thing. This is NOT in the order I experienced them. OK

disclaimer: The story you are about to read is to be completely ignored.
	    I wrote this while Princess Diana was merely injured in a car
	    crash. She hadn't expired yet. 
	    4 hours later I learned of her death.
	    Dead.
	    I can't make fun of the dead.
	    So until someone figures out the Zombification drug and brings
	    her back to life, IGNORE THE FOLLOWING:
   Princess Diana dumped her car in the Chapamaquody River last night and
lived to tell about it. She swam all the way to the Atlantic where the 
currents took her right up the east coast to the Peter Bent Brigham Hospital.
She was found beached next to a dumpster behind a Pizza Hut on Brookline Ave.
   Now her boyfriend didn't fare so well. He was aparently trapped in the
car until it reached the Federal Trades Commission building. He was thrown
from the car and spit onto the beach like Jonah out of the whale, pronounced
dead and promptly Knighted in a sunrise ceremony by Ted Kennedy and Chris
Dodd.
   While Princess Diana is somewhere between critical and really bad, 
Senator Kennedy is somewhere between Scarborough Beach, RI and Kennebunk ME.

New York, NY - Half a million people marched on the New York Post Office
Friday to protest postal brutality.
   Catalyst for the march was an event exactly one year ago today on 
Columbus Avenue. A poodle was sniffing a letter carrier's back leg when
worker Claude Debuse Concherto made a furtive gesture that cost him his job.
   The dog turned up dead, the house burned down with three people in it and
the family Datsun's charred remains were found upside down in the back yard
over a rose bush.
   After an investigation it was determined that Concherto maced the poodle,
kicked her in the head, strangled her with her own hair ribbon and then 
beat her over the head senseless with a stack of Publisher's Clearing House
Sweepstakes.
   Concherto said it best in court Friday: "I maced the poodle, kicked her
in the head, strangled her with her own hair ribbon and then beat her over
the head senseless with a stack of Publisher's Clearing House Sweepstakes."
   Concherto admitted to torching the building down to cover up a Haitian
drug ring inside that had been selling ginger peanut garlic sauce on the
black market for 4 years. Two family members are still at large and Concherto
will be testifying as to their wherabouts tomorrow.
   Concherto is expected to sing.

Martha's Vinyard - Connie Chung has announced a wildcat strike.
   "I'm not interviewing anyone anymore," said Chung.
   "At least not until I get a Whopper." She said she will not interview
Clinton about the Royal family, the downing of flight 69, or even Hillary's
swimsuit this year. Chung is striking for better pay, wealth benefits, a
burger and a meeting at the Russian Tea Room with Barbara Streisand, Billy
Joel, Tipper Gore and Ozzy Osbourne.

YNTL --> Yellow Journalism Intentional.
Shawano, WI - Folksinging is now illegal in Forest, Langlade, Lincoln, 
Oneida, Wood and Vilas counties.
   40-60 folksingers were arrested at their annual song circle, cowboy 
poetry, hootenany, rave July 8, 1997. The charges? Unlawful assembly, 
Shindigging without a permit and discharging a C minor chord within city
limits.

	 5 years after the quincentennial:
	 It's Time to:
	       MAKE OCTOBER 12TH
	    INDIGENOUS PEOPLES DAY,

      Free Leonard Peltier,
       Stop Forced Relocation at Big Mountain,
       and Build a Movement for Justice
	 and Human Rights for All!

       Five years ago, in 1992, hundreds of thousands, if not millions
of people throughout the Americas spoke out and acted in opposition
to the government sponsored celebrations of Christopher Columbus and in
support of the rights of indigenous peoples.
	However today, in 1997, AIM activist Leonard Peltier sits in 
prison during this 21st year of incarceration for an act the government knows
he did not commit. It has been revealed that the FBI withheld from his
trial evidence that proves his innocence.
	In northeast Arizona, in the Black Mesa area, 3,000 indigenous
people are fighting forced relocation from their land because Peabody
Western Coal Company wants it to make profits.
	And there are numerous other examples of both continuing repression
and continuing resistance by indigenous peoples against violations of
their rights.
	Join with people around the country who will be fasting from Oct 1 
through 12, fasting for part of that time, organizing local demonstrations
and actions, or acting in other ways in solidarity with Leonard Peltier,
the Big Mountain resisters, other struggling Native American peoples and
for the human rights of all.
	We will never be free in this country until we face up to the
historic record, set it straight and get it right. "Getting it right" means
honoring, upholding and joining in solidarity with those who have much
to teach us about living in harmony with the natural world, about working
cooperatively for the good of all, and about steadfastness in struggle
despite the most difficult conditions. We urge you to join us this October.
