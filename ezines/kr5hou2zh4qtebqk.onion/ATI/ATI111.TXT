Dear Prime:
A ONE YEAR BAN ON ROADBUILDING???
Johnny Appleseed

Dear Friend:
   Thank you for your thoughtful letter. I appreciate your sharing
with me your ideas about an issue that is important to you and to
many others.
   At this time in our nation's history, many of the decisions 
facing the President are complex and challenging. Your views, and
the views of other individuals who take the time to write, are
carefully considered when the President makes a policy decision.
   Thank you again for writing. I am grateful for your support
and for your interest.
   Sincerely yours,
   Hillary Rodham Clinton

   "It simply broke my heart knowing that all these people, mostly
teenage girls were spending all that money and time on stamps, 
stationary, perfume and pictures; and sending them to me - when 
my agent was paying someone $30,000 a year and his only job
was to bag up everything but the day's random sample and send all 
the rest to the dump."
   -David Cassidy. From a recent autobiography.

MARCO THE WALKER
       an Interview with the Prime Anarchist 
               by David Fischer.  May 1993
                     from Infinite Onion magazine.
                            Issue 8
Today Marco the walker is in Washington DC doing some advance activism
for the walk which is right now in Columbus, OH. They expect to arrive
in DC October 7th. There is a homeless occupation from October 3rd to
November 3rd (election day) and also Veterans for Peace are on a 42 day
hunger strike on the capitol steps. Another walk that's meeting Marco's
walk started in Panama. Also there are many caravans, runs and walks
throughout Turtle Island. Most are expected to converge on the Nevada
Test Site... which rightfully belongs to the western Shoshone people.
   AIM is calling for October 13th to be "unplug America" day. Marco
is hoping that everyone will spend the whole day riding a horse, reading
a book, walking around or just relaxing. No appliances please, and 
hopefully at least no television.
HOW LONG HAVE YOU BEEN WALKING?
I joined up on February 28 in Black Mesa, AZ.  
DO I NEED TO ASK WHAT COMPELLED YOU? YOU'RE GRINNING.
I was in a sweatlodge ceremony and Husky Tso came in for the 3rd
round sharing info about the walk. He spoke to me in prayer and I 
found myself dropping everything else in my life to begin my walk
from Arizona to DC.                                     
WHAT IS THE WALK ABOUT?
We are people from all the 4 colors from all the four directions 
gathering to speak out against the last 500 years of genocide, 
repression, racism and continued injustice toward my native American
brothers and sisters. Being a black Russian Jew, a white Russian Jew
and a Swedish Christian, I have nothing but compassion for the 
victims of the last 500 years of American holocaust. There is nothing
I can do about the past except smile warmly and say sorry; but for 
the future I will not tolerate another 500 years of this shit. Not 
while I'm around anyways.
WHAT'S A TYPICAL RESPONSE WHEN YOU DRIFT INTO TOWN?
Wow. A typical response. I hate picking on rednecks, but there's been
a few in every town we went to through OK, KS, NB, SD, IA and IN.
"Where are you walking to?" they say as we hand them a flyer that 
says we're walking to DC.
   "What are you walking for?" they say as they read the only 2 
paragraphs that describe why we walk. After we tell them about it,
they usually just say "Wow, that's a long way." We ARE seeing a lot
of people waking up everywhere though. Today Elad and I had an Amway
looking guy tell us our presence took him back to his younger days 
when he drove around in a VW bus during college. We figured that was
before he met Tom Hayden and Jerry Rubin and found he could get himself
lost in network multilevels and stuff. Our convoy made him late for 
his appointment. Who knows maybe he'll tell his boss where to stick
it and we'll see him in short little dreadlocks throwing his shampoo
bottle from the world trade center or something.
IS THERE A CONNECTION TO BIG MOUNTAIN? WHAT IS IT?
CRAZIEST STORY?
WHAT CONVINCED YOU TO JOIN THE aRMY AND WHAT CONVINCED YOU TO GET OUT?
WHERE WERE YOU WHEN THE RIOTS STARTED?
WHAT IS THE FUEL OF THE REVOLUTION, IS IT RICE?

(CON'T NEXT ISSUE...)


      "Why will you take by force
    What you may have quietly by love?"
"Why will you destroy us who supply you with food? What can
you get by war? We can hide our provisions and run into the
woods. Then you will starve for wrongdoing your friends. Why
are you jealous of us? We are unarmed and willing to give you
what you ask, if you come in a friendly manner."
      Chief Powhatan, 1607, Colony of Virginia

   a poem. anonymous.

Not even knowing your name,
I do know your smile though;
And your voice just the same.

I now know from the slip where
I ate my french fries.
I sit lingering one more moment,
Wishing you'd look my way

Just once more-
So I can memorize
your eyes.

AN OPEN LETTER TO GANNETT CORPORATION:
from Prime Anarchist

Two weeks ago this very day, you ran a review of a book about 
Hopi people in one of your many southern New England newspapers.
I was very excited to see it but quite let down as Nancy Hall 
had barely scratched the surface in her review.
   I'll bet it's got more to do with how much you allowed your
paper to GRANT HER than her ability to write a great story about
some really profound, prolific and precious people.
   I lived on the Navajo reservation for 2 years in the 90's and
went to Hopi at least twice a week to play my guitar for tips --
my only income those years to help my army severance pay last 
more than the expected six months.
   Not to be rude, but you people under Gannett, I'm sure you know
all ABOUT severance pays; and I'm sure relocation too - an issue
close-to-heart dear to the Hopi people.
   These things and a whole lot more were never mentioned as Nancy
Hall's story ran your gantlet.
   I'll leave you with a beautiful legend that "wandered" around 
while I was herding sheep, chopping wood, and hauling water for the
elders.
   Everyone knows why there's a Nazarene Church in Hotevilla, AZ today,
but I'll tell you just in case.
   Long ago in Northeastern Arizona every other Mission attempt
had resulted in a church burning down - and everyone from Baptists,
to Mormons, Assembly Of Gods, "even the bornagains," kept going home
and giving up. The fires weren't arson. Hopi would pray 9 days for
lightning whenever newcomers showed up, including the missionaries.
If lightning struck a newcomer, that was a sign they weren't in the 
right place.
   There are no records of suspicious fires in Hotevilla, AZ but if
you read back in papers a couple hundred years, there is some level
of truth to the lightning fires.
   Now when Church of the Nazarene was building their House of Worship
and planning their inter-denominational services - the Hopi elders were
all praying for lightning. Except one. Thomas Byanyca's grandfather,
I forgot his name - was it David? I hope so.
   He was meeting in Kiva with a Nazarene elder. There were snakes,
corn, children, crosses, Bibles, even Navajo sand painting around.
   "This Massau," the Nazarene elder said, "you worship him - he reminds
us a lot of our Jesus of Nazareth, for we've studied your people's 
ways a little bit."
   "Yes," said the Hopi elder, "perhaps they met each other in 0073 AD.
We dance a ceremony with the Tibetan monks every hundred years about
that one. Your Jesus, this son of David reminds us a lot of Massau who
Creator sent in the only form we humans can know and recognize."
   Well to make a long story short the Nazarene elder asked "Chief"
David if they minded a Nazarene mission there.
   "So long as you're always respectful from all directions," said the
Hopi elder. "Our mission has been waiting here for more than 3,000 
years." 
   That's about all I can say for now except that I have seen with my
own two eyes that we truly ARE all of us related; and this "vision" 
leaves a long lasting smile on my face.
   Thank you Nancy Hall for pulling this out of me.
   And thank you Gannett Corporation (you too, Rosylyn Carter!!!)
For pissing me off.

                          WHAT WILL U MISS WHEN U DIE?
                          a prime anarchist poem exercise
                          (try it yourself)

I will miss my guitar when I die
I will miss my friends.
I will miss all my successes and failures.
Old newspaper articles with my byline.
My worn out old college transcript.
Old jobs I worked.
I will miss my mom when I die.
I've already missed my father when he died in his 40's
I already miss my sister 1100 miles away
In our hometown which I also miss.
I will miss her more.
I'll miss my allergies.
Sisyphus mucus maximus. In my
Throat since I was
12.
Shall miss food when I die.
Coffee. I'll miss coffee when I die.
Oh Lord let there be coffee in heaven.
I can miss my friends and relatives in death
I already do in life.
Don't make me miss YOUR goddess Caffeina.


ROARING CRESCENDO '92: 14 or 19???
by Marco Capelli Frucht

While half of Europe was dying of consumption
Half of the other other half was to invade Turtle Isle
Proceeding to consume at an alarming rate.
Spreading fear and fertilizer, discontent and hate.
Will we survive??? Will we survive?? Will we
Survive? Keeping up - building up - roaring up
At this, this overwhelming pace. 
The word "no" is written on every overweight and underweight
Face.
