William Jefferson Clinton will tell us this Tuesday Night that
the air-war over Iraq has officially begun. He has until Feb 28,
(the beginning of Ramadan) to finish MOP-UP!!!
Do you believe for a minute he is considering anything besides
a full-scale nuclear attack??? How would N-E thing else be 
possible in so few weeks?!? 
   IN THE NAME OF GOD I CHARGE YOU. STOP YOUR GOVERNMENT AT ONCE.

Here's a poem submission by the Floridian.
Celluloid and Cellophane.
A poesie about Disney World and Tupperware, corp.

Movies and munchies
Archive your footage and store your food.
Colorize film and co ordinate your cabinets.
A finished product is "in the can."
Stowing away in the fridge is "cooling."
Pollution, acid rain, chopping trees.
Filling in swamp after swamp.
Bring in more, more more.
Movies, munchies more more more.
What's in store?
What are we here for?
Consume, consume. Plastic.
That's what we're here for;
Plastic - fantastic.
Foodstuff and films. Movies & munchies.
Celuloid and cellophane.

Eat a fresh asparagus spear.
See, hear, feel live jazz.
In season.
Now.
Ain't no plastic about it.
Cook with olive oil -- 
Pam can kiss your ass.

Let's open a Walmart in Disney
and SELL RUBBERMAID TOOLBOXES.



(ed note: thank you floridian. I'll callback with this:
A poem I wrote in '96 titled: TO MM

A boy wolf sits gnawing his arm 
Urgently - chooses to chew his wrist
Rather than the rope he's attached by.
         SACRIFICE - 
The arm-and-leg of life.
It will cost him a right hand.
The one that will forever 
Cling to a bomb.
He will live without 
The bomb may not
     If only we
            can
            all            sever
       from the           violence
        that is
           us.

Thanks for the bit of culture.

INFINITE ONION INTERVIEWS PRIME ANARCHIST. 1992.
(part III. continued from last issue)

IO: Where were you when the riots started? 
When the LA Fiasco began I was in some town west of Oklahoma
City watching some mayor name their main street Garth Brooks
Avenue. He took the sign down that said 23rd ST. and put up 
a big green and white plaque that said Garth Brooks Ave. Turns
out it's his hometown where he learned how to ride a bike. 
Probably last year.
   By the time 14 were dead in the riots I was in Tulsa at 
some new-age healing spa called PATH. 3 days. If I 
remember, Hitler's birthday was shortly after the riots I 
was thinking about Colo Spgs' Acacia Park and the 
three or four times I've been beaten up by Colo Spgs 
police. One of the times where the DEA were involved 
still has me so traumatized (eight months later!)
that I can't be inside anywhere and look at a door. I have to
look everywhere else or I see guerilla looking cops in Timberline
combat boots busting the door off the hinges, stepping on my 
head and pointing streetsweepers, AK's and 10 mils at my face. I
usually "come to" when they're shouting "get your head down, get
your fucking head down!" Then I realize I'm in a plain old room
fairly safe. That really sucks while in a sweatlodge ceremony
or an after-vision-quest ceremony. They come in looking for Peyote.
We don't have any but still to jail we go for 5 hours and have
to walk back home. Does this kind of trauma have to happen to
EVERY US CITIZEN before you all wake up and realize this is
fascism revisited??? Economic slavery? A police state? Look at 
your big old rectangular door and tell me if you feel safe. If
you're on Turtle Island anywhere the ground you're on is owned
"on paper" by the army corps of engineers. It's truly owned by
God and the people He put in charge of it got slaughtered by
smallpox, Amtrack, turkey shoots, lynchings, scalpings, 
relocation policies, BIA boarding schools and Crazy Horse Malt
Liquor Beer.
   If you feel the least bit uneasy, please take back your life
and help me stop this madness. We need to find some nonviolent 
way to take over this country. Because the only other thing I 
see is violent bloody overthrow and as much as I personally
would enjoy watching that... it wouldn't be good for all of us.
And it's certainly not good for my mother... the earth.

       DOWN AND OUT IN MR. PEABODY'S COALTRAIN 
              by the arch chorus pondent

   The following was sent in by Jon Norstog
   -----------------------------------------
   Mr. Alvin Clinton has passed away


        During the Rapporteur's visit, I ran into Grace Smith who 
   told me that Alvin Clinton had passed away at his home on Feb.  1.  
   He was to have given testimony on the desecration of Star
   Mountain, among other issues.

        The family asked to be allowed to bury him near his home.  
   There was no response for a couple days, then a denial.  
   As a result the funeral was held in Winslow on Thursday, at the
   Catholic Church and cemetery.  The family was devastated, 
   both by the loss of their husband/father/grandfather, and more 
   by having to bury him outside Dine' Bikeya, across the
   river.   It was a very ugly thing for them to have to face 
   at that time.

        I knew Mr. Clinton about 10 years. No one who knew him will 
   ever forget that man.  He was a man who defended his country in 
   World War II, then spent the rest of his life defending
   his land and religion, and the Dine' people.  Elmer Clark, his 
   chay, compared him to Manuelito, Ganado Mucho and Barboncito, 
   and that's how he'll be remembered, I think.  His life showed
   that if you stand up for what you believe you will pay a heavy 
   price, but all the same, it can be done.  In the end, I think 
   that what he was fighting for will be accomplished. 


        Mr. Clinton was also a philosopher or theologian.  
   He didn't just memorize the ceremonies.  He was always thinking 
   about traditional religion, the stories and elements of it,
   building on it.  The Dine' religion was a working system of 
   thought for him, one he used to come up with ideas and thoughts 
   that have never been said or heard on earth before.  He was like
   Moses that way. Some of us were also reminded how Moses led the 
   Children of Israel through the wilderness for forty years, but 
   was not allowed to pass with them into the land of milk &
   honey.  The spirit of Moses lives in the promise of the Moshiach, 
   so I think Mr. Clinton's spirit will live in the struggle which continues.

        After the service we all went out to the Clintons' place at Teesto.  
   The whole community showed up, people I haven't seen in one place 
   together in over a year. President Hale sent a representative, who gave 
   the family a memorial letter.  The weather was good enough to eat
   outside, although you could smell ice in the wind that came up in the
   afternoon.


        *****************************************************

        I sat with Phoebe Nez to eat at the Clintons.  She said she was
   relocating, not to "New Lands" but across the fence into the NPL.  
   "We're just tired of the rangers coming around all the time," 
   she said.

        The Dine' Bikeya Committee at Teesto has a new president.  
   Sam Keyonnie, Judy Keyonnie's brother, is back on the land and 
   is willing to be a community leader.  The Teesto Community has 
   always been on its own, without the strong support group
   presence found at Big Mountain.  For this reason, Teesto 
   has always had strong leaders and has been able usually to
   make its own decisions as a community.  Unfortunately the 
   government's tactics in getting people to sign the 
   "Accommodation Agreement" caused a lot of division in the
   community and as a result the Dine' Bikeya Committee 
   splintered for a while.  The dinner at the Clinton's home
   showed, I think, that the community was ready to get back together.

        At Red Willow I learned that the Benally family had also been 
   denied permission to bury Alice Benally in the area where her prayers 
   were.  She was buried in the NPL, in an area where she had relatives.  
   This is the first anyone had heard that there had been a denial of 
   permission for a traditional burial.  This is a serious matter.  
   Congress instructed the parties to the P.L. 104-301 settlement 
   that it expected this issue to be resolved.  Apparently the 
   resolution is that no traditional burial will be permitted.  
   The US, which engineered the "settlement" and is
   responsible for most of its terms, can not really deny 
   responsibility for this violation of the Dine'
   right to free expression of their traditional religion.

Japan demandin so much soybeans
My Reebox're gettin' worn.

Makin me fertilize with Pfizer's gotten me so worn out
Doubt we can last another year if we get another 1 of drought.

But I prayed to Creator 4 vision 'n here's what he had 2 say
Son I can get you all U need -n- plentya room for that hay.

(ch) Cause I got 60 acres for corn 
'n 60'll gimme soy
'nother 60 I oughta just keep empty, empty, empty
Well 60 more's for wheat.
'n 60'll give ya beans 'n' stuff. 
Well I believe that leaves 60 more for
        hemp hemp hemp hempty whoa oh.

Got a man in a 3-piece suit now tell me what I oughta do
Oughta sell it off to him now says he'd like him a farm or 2.
Says he can turn him a profit. Knows how the market runs.
Well what good's a dude in a 3-piece suit where there ain't no
                          drugz & gunz.

So I got down on my knees now n I began to pray
From way down wavin' by the wheatfiled, 
     This 'what the good Lord say.

(ch)

Some say agrabusiness is the way this land oughta go
But I asked my old Indian uncle he said no that just ain't so
Told me credit didn't buy ya nothin that didn't come in a can.
Said go pick what's in season, it's all in the master plan.
You do your farm your own way,  n  pray every chance you get.
Thank the sun and the rain now, and you'll have the best crop yet...
   (spoken:) Oh, and he said, "pfuck pfizer, too."
