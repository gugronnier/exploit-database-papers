>who suffer from the effects of war,
>but sometime for people whose illnesses are caused by contact with

>dance with them and then the men have to give the women something valuable

PRIME ANARCHIST here. This is ATI issue #
It's Sunday, July 20, it's 7:20 p.m. 

I have a one line pap #'s run. But first this.
About the article you just read, keep in mind that it is NOT the Hopi PEOPLE
that are against the Navajo resisters living on their lands but the 
tribal government that CLAIMS to represent. That is key.
I know. I've lived there many months, many times. That was the only 
misleading part of the "B-fore mentioned" article, so I figured rather 
than change a single paragraph, line or bit-abyte I'd give you the whole
shabang. Uncensored, unedited, un-gate-keepered. Dig? OK.

                           Exxon is real outsider

An Editorial
The Capital Times
July 10, 1997

     How intriguing that the critics of a recent protest against the
     proposed Exxon mine would choose to dismiss the protesters as
     ``outsiders,'' while missing the fact that the real outsiders in
     Wisconsin's mining debate are multinational corporations such as,
     well, Exxon.

     The Earth First! environmental group has launched a series of
     protests against the mine, which would be located near Crandon,
     and this development seems to have unsettled apologists for
     out-of-state mining interests. This is understandable, because
     opposition to the proposed mine is so widespread in Wisconsin 
     that mine supporters have to be feeling a tad beleaguered by the
     prospect of national environmental groups adding their voices to
     the chorus.

     Rather than attempt to argue the merits of the Exxon mine,
     however, critics of Earth First!, including our friends at the
     Wisconsin State Journal, have begun to portray protesters as
     ``mining outsiders.'' ``Self-serving noise like that generated
     Monday by Earth First! is not welcome,'' snarled the WSJ in
     response to a nonviolent protest outside the Crandon Mining Co.
     office that saw 29 arrests.

     What the mining apologists miss is that much of the Earth First!
     activism surrounding the Crandon mine issue has been organized by
     Earth First! activists from, you guessed it, Wisconsin. And even
     if there are Wisconsinites who may object to the civil
     disobedience component of the Earth First! protests, it is
     impossible to argue with the fact that opposition to the mining
     project is widespread among residents of the Crandon area -- as
     evidenced by township elections last spring, which were swept by
     mining foes.

     One of the reasons the opposition to the mining project is so
     widespread is because of concerns about Exxon, a corporation with
     a dubious environmental record, which Wisconsinites simply do not
     trust to protect the state's natural resources.

     Exxon has no connection to Wisconsin, and no commitment to the
     state's environmental or conservation traditions. In contrast,
     the opposition to the Exxon mine is home-grown and rooted in the
     grass-roots environmental tradition of Wisconsin.

     If the mining apologists want to push ``outsiders'' out of the
     debate, we are quite certain that the opponents of the mine --
     including the people from Earth First! -- would be more than
     happy to oblige. So long as we start with the biggest outsider of
     all: Exxon.

This is from my friend Laurie. Those of you following back from the late
80's ATI days might remember her...
(you'll notice that this issue is mostly a "forwarded-letters-to-the- 
editor" format. Hope this doesn't get too boring too fast. Next weekish
we should be settled into our new headquarters and ready for the weekly
ATI's you've all come to know and love. (or at least tolerate.))

(notas primeras, you'll also notice there is no correspondence report
from ground zero, and no journal poem to end the issue out. I'll have to 
compose one on the spot perhaps. And next week will be a new journal poem
and perhaps a ground zero column. <clears throat> perhaps a ground zero
column? hint hint.)


Hi,

My name is Kevin Brownlow and I am a journalism major at Michigan State
University.  Currently, we have one large campus daily, which has become
grossly outdated with what the students want to read.  I would love to get
some kind of input, if you would, to give me some ideas to
start an alternative weekly.  I would really like to get information on
organization, finances, recruitment, along with any other important
information.

Thank you,

Kevin Brownlow

               THE OIL MYTH.
               (c) 1998. Prime H. Anarchist

               Wars and rumors of war
               Oil and rumors of oil
               
               I've got a girl for you tonite,
               I tell Dennis Rodman;
               After the game,
               You know
               You and her...
               "Is she UGGGGGLY?" is his
               Only question -
               For beauty, is an asset.
               Can be measured, manipulated manhandled
               & capitalized upon.

               Mr. Speaker, I say, Mr. Prez, Mrs. Prez:
               I yield my thyme and beg to reserve
               It back just long enough to 
               Tell you about a 
               New small country.
               Looking for democracy, freedom,
               Help from US, advisors, politicians,

               Through open, American monitored
               Elections.

               Are they oil-less, you ask me.
               They ask me, she asks me.
               Mrs. Speaker, for oil is an asset.
               Can be sized, sounded for, measured,
               Sucked, raped and capitalized upon.

               'Cause if she ugggggly---
               Won' give her my time no how.

               For if they LACK oil,
               We're JUS' nah INTRIST'D.

               Oil
               And rumors
               Of oil.
