Hello and welcome to ATI issue 96. The best one I've ever written!
It's sunday 830pm. I'll begin with a submission. Our first in 3 weeks.
(hint hint hint...)

09/08 the y2k problem will affect 00info.txt files etc., mucking up the
directory listing.

09/11  a group of businessmen gather around a mock-up of a future town,
their building plans 30 years into the future: "we aim to pillage the 
land with this development and ruin our town for our children."

                            <-- the arm of culture:
                            goes through society
                            all humans have power to change with it--

Not just TV movies media as they want you to think--
But control of the arm is open to everybody.

Like the world of "rice pudding -- no pizza" (1900) we're going to a 
world of "no rice pudding -- pizza" (2000).

This demonstrates the arm of culture & its constant change.

This Michael Stutz article typed in by hand by the Prime Anarchist due to
PAP's insisting upon using beat up old antique and thereby incompatible
machines such as IBM PC Convertible 8088 laptops, NEC PowerMate 1 Plus 286
desktops, MAC SE 68000 whatchamacallits, and etc. (yes! mac&fax) 
over 40 billion rainforests served.
Prime Anarchist says,
   Phuch recycling. REUSE IT OR DIE!!!
    
OK that said, it's TTYme for my column and then on to running numbers and
dates. HMMM. OK. NUMBERS DATES AND WALNUTS. NUMBERS DATES AND WALNUTS.

Princess Diana is dead, get over it. Brooke Shields should have been 
driving that car. She said it herself. Shut up Brooke. You would've choked
on your american cheese, whitebread and mayonaise sandwich the minute those
motorcycles started chasing you. You wouldn't've hit that telephone pole
you would've swerved to miss that doubledecker bus full of schoolchildren
and dumped it in the THAMES with all of you dying; you wrinkled old ex-
lolita brat. Shut up!
   I'm so sick of television. Will someone please take out their webtv and
shut the flogging thing down?
   Pleeeeeeeeeeeeeze?
   This is not a joke: How many websurfers does it take to sign a guestbook?

Beginning fiscal 98 all vegetarians will be able to continue calling their
cost of living adjustment (ie: 4% payraise) a "cola." So drink up.
All meat eaters must begin calling it a cost of living INCREASE.
   "Coli."
   Eat up...

What do 3,47, 567, 6897, 7892, 432675, and 23 have in common?
   Silly... They're all numbers.

HOW DIFFICULT CAN IT BE???
 
This #'s run brought to you by pap, prime anarchist productions has nothing
to do with the AMA, Prime Computer systems, inc, or ATI modems. IN fact
they each owe the prime anarchist seven dollars for use of his name

Prime Anarchist, I bet you don't even have the balls to print this.
You fucking suck. fuck my little sister, you sack of shit. fuck my penis.
eat shit while fucking your mother's father.
   (note: you should've signed this. Maybe I would've decided to print it
   30 seconds quicker. Here's to you being wrong... (I WILL say that was
   the STUPIDEST, most ILLITERATIST, silliest dorkiest, dweeby and downright
   DUMBEST letter to the editor I've EVER received in my LIFE. If this
   were a respekible newzpape, I would've made many copies of your letter 
   so that I could get off on hitting my delete button a gazillion times!!!)

JOURNAL POEM 24
Cappuccino.
Monkey and Bull make meal of
Pomegranite, potatoes, pineapple & peppers.
LL Zamenhof worked Pepsi's graveyard
Shift til the day he died. Poetic.
Death not for lack of irony.
For growing calamity, asks Esperanza,
Does one need fertilizer?
Removes tongue from cheek.
1477. Chris visits Iceland inquiring
As a wannabe Portugese picking up
Waterfront gossip of "the NewFound Lands."
Looks like Lawnmower Man on valium.
Vacation - Grape Cod. Dwelling on payola,
Punkrock, and plasma in Adobe Abode.
Hystorically, a bladder bag full of bull.
Mother Earth, you are beaux, bela, belle,
Beautiful - Where's Dr. Esperanto
When you NEED him??

Peabody Coal purchases Cavenham 
Forest for a copper penny.
Mrs. Farthing leaves a pie on her porch for
The plutonium miners. Make mine a strip so
Rare IT'S STILL IN THE GROUND.
Spineless as a Portugese Man O'War, now if
That ain't the scumm calling the scummsucker scummy.
Sage tea makes sore throat to merely a wet
Groggy flemmy thing; yet Dire Wolf offers
12-page thesis on Yak semen.
Can God hear you in a Hindu Ashram?
"Yes," yells Yayo. She's 12 and SMARTER than you.

Who IS this Open Mike?
Just some honest Joe?
Stench fries and fillet of potatoes at
The Full Spoon Cafe.

And Bo Diddley's cook wears wine-red

Pampa, TX. Letting go of Police Brutality -
Release, relax, relief.
2:30 a.m. Katy reads poetry for tips at the

      Thomas Jefferson or Johnny Cash?

Movado watch with moon minute hand,
I straddle the corner of Florence
& Normandy contemplating cops.
A house full of cat-tails never falls;

And Medina pours Mecca a 20 oz. cup of
Mocha java.
