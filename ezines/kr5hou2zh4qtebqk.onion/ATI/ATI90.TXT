Dear Prime Anarchist,
About that "Who the phuck is he???" story: 
Actually I get this all the time :) The guy who wrote that book (Which 
is pretty good, but no hacking secrets) is named "Knightmare" and his 
REAL name is Dennis Fiery. I have had my 2 handles since before I ever 
heard of Fiery. "The Knightmare", and "Lord Knightmare" have always been 
the 2 handles I have used, depending on the circle of friends I am in...
Yeah, I know Crunch :)
Also, I am in the beginning stages of possibly my own book, which I hope 
will provide a good overview of the world of Phreaking and Hacking... 
Yeah, buy the book. It is decent.

Thanks,
Lord Knightmare.

Oh /-\$$ t0 all of y0u |< rad d00ds 
who still talk shit about Mitnick,
this guy is one of the few people 
alive who could trully divert on a
celuliar phone, while he might not 
have been much on a unix guy he 
was a VMS master(how many of you 
gimps have even touched DCL I wonder...) 
and he still schooled a NSA spook.  
That, in my book, gets brownie points.  
He was one of the worlds most 
knowledgable Phone Phreaks and he could    (ED NOTE: I WOULDN'T  
school all of you Redboxing, never          GO THAT FAR)
*heard*of*Ess*or*SxS, ratshack shopping
glorified mall rats.  I keep hearing 
people running off at their mouth 
about Mitnick, even people that I 
respect(sorry Sadena).  It pisses 
me off and I had to get that off my chest.
I have not read the Poulson story by        (2ND NOTE and then I'll
Littman, but you are right on about          shut up: Well, there
Mitnick.. one bad ass dude... I have         you go...)
ALOT of respect for him. He was
really railroaded.... Wish there 
were something we could all do. 
People who run their mouth about 
Mitnick (Which, as of yet, I have not
heard anyone do this..) don't know 
SHIT about his skills. Very gifted
would be my words... And he is has been 
a regular contributing writer
for 2600 for the longest time. Who can 
dispute the experts? Wanna tell
Emmanuel that Mitnick is not good enough 
to write for 2600? Heh, he
would tell you to kiss his ass. 
Just thought I would have my say. Kevin 
Mitnick will always be known as one of 
the Elite.

COLO (Colorado Springs) - Focus On the Family has called for an
All-Christian ban on the "Magic Eye" newspaper cartoon.
   "It bugs out your eyes along with your mind," says Rev. Bob Dobbs, cult
leader of the entire FOF chain. "so then it has you open and ready for
Satan to just come on in there and tell you, well, tell you just about
anything." Dobbs went on to describe the process in great detail in such
a graphic way that this PAWN reporter got a woodie. Dobbs is calling on
his whole flock, "and everyone else's flock for that matter," to just
ignore it when you see it, and prepare for the next comic strip burnings
coming to a church near you.

PAWN (Prime Anarchist World News
Westminster, England -- Two thespians have been trying to raise a 
child for the last eleven years. 
   "It's great. We're having the time of our lives," said Robert Inglun,
who's playing the mom. Inglun says it's hard work, but worthwhile, and
that after a time, the child should become a thespian himself.
   "Not so," says Cletus Kingrich, minority leader in the house of 
Ladies. "An emphatic no way. We just won't stand for it. I mean how can
two thespians raise a child. That kid will never know what role he or she
is really supposed to play.


Here is my report from the James Taylor show at 
Harkness Saturday night.    by Carl Franklin

Clear sky.
Crescent moon.
Shooting stars.
Comfortable air.
Nobody screaming.
Nobody standing up.
Large video monitor over the stage.
Camera crew.
Crystal clear sound system.
Four backup singers.
James takes the stage.

Solo guitar.
Something in the way she moves.
First verse.
Beautiful.
Second verse.
Backup singers.
Chorus.
Band comes in.
Crowd very happy.

One song.
Then another.
Then another.
We are sucked in.
We are listening to our own thoughts.
Our own feelings.

Take a break.
Lighten up.
James talks to us.
"Hello, out there on the lawn!"
We wave and whistle.
The crowd shouts requests.
James lets them talk.
For an eternity.
"Shutup" he tells them.
In jest.
We laugh.

The sun has set.
Next song.
Frozen man.
Confusion.
Happiness.
Sadness.
I can relate.

The show is over.
Way too soon.

First encore.
Shed a little light.
"Let us turn our thoughts today
To Martin Luther King
And recognize that there are ties between us
All men and women
Living on the earth
Ties of hope and love
Sister and brotherhood"

Peace.
Love.
Understanding.
Catharsis.
Weeping.

Second encore.
Sweet Baby James.
Everyone sings along.

Third encore.
How Sweet It Is.

Indeed, James.
Indeed.

JOHNSVILLE, IL, RENAMED WALMART #11717 
JOHNSVILLE, IL--In a special town-square ceremony Friday, Mayor Byron
Elkins officially renamed the town of Johnsville, IL, pop. 2,372, WalMart
#11717. "All WalMart #11717ians can be proud to call WalMart #11717 their
home," the mayor said. "I think we can all agree that WalMart #11717 is a
wonderful place to work and shop." Added Elkins: "Go WalMart #11717 High
Cougars!" Other residents of WalMart #11717 were equally enthusiastic. "The
arrival of WalMart in our town this year caused dozens of stores to close,
eliminating over 400 jobs," said greeter and mother of three Marianne
Gross. "But on the bright side, nearly 150 jobs have been created by the
new store." Citizens of WalMart #11717 who behave will receive a
subcutaneous corporate-identification implant chip good for an employee
discount at any WalMart store.

EXECUTIVE, LEGISLATIVE, JUDICIAL BRANCHES MERGE 
WASHINGTON, DC--Seeking to streamline federal affairs and give the
government a much-needed shot in the arm, the three federal branches inked
an unprecedented $12 trillion merger deal Monday. "No more will the three
branches bicker and argue and overrule each other," President Clinton said
of the merger, reportedly the largest of its kind since last year's
ABC-Disney deal. "This merger should give the federal government tremendous
synergy, a kind of 'cross-pollinization' that the framers of the
Constitution never envisioned when they developed the now-antiquated system
of 'checks and balances' so long ago." In the first major move since the
merger's announcement, on Tuesday Supreme Court Justice Stephen Breyer
ordered mandatory military conscription for all adult males in preparation
for a September invasion of Iraq.
