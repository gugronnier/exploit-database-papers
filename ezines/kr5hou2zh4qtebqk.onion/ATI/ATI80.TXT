PAP - Prediction of the week for Sunday this first of June in the year
of our Abbie Hoffman, Nineteen Ninety Seven:
   "MMMBop" by Hansen will be one and a half times the smash hit that 
"Achey Brakey" as sung by Billy Ray Cyrus was because it contains 50%
more chords.
   That's right; God as my witness. "MMM..." contains an A, a D and an E;
whereas "Ackey..." can only claim an A and an E. Any more would have made
his heart blow up I guess. Of course the Hansen boys have everyone's 
hearts right this moment because they sound like the Jackson 5ive before,
during AND after Michael's twice weekly estrogen treatments.
   I'm prime anarchist and that's my opinion.
AND THIS IS ATI 80.

HOFFMAN'S BICYCLE RIDE: An ATI Wade Davis excerptview by Prime Anarchist.
1943. Albert Hoffman made the 25th manipulation of LSD derivatives when he
noticed his fingers tingle. He thought it odd so he hopped on his bicycle
and rode home hoping to rest. One of the most momentous bicycle rides in
history. He later chose to WALK home after trying 42 mushrooms.
   Wade Davis recounted this story in an NPR interview this year about his
Harvard professor Richard Evan Shultes, who 4 years ahead of Hoffman had
found LSD's natural analog in a sacred Aztec plant. If you're not sure
where you know Wade Davis' name from, he wrote "Serpent and The Rainbow."
Rather than publish a whole transcript, I'm going to "dot" the next 5 or 6
ATI's with a few short but quite profound Davis quotes. Just wherever I find
appropriate, or perhaps on pure whim where they belong... (or just go)

PAWN -- (national desk.) PENTAGON APPROVES PEYOTE.
   Washington has decided that for American Indians serving in the military
the use of Peyote is an essential part of religious ceremonies and has 
withdrawn the ban.
   Members of the military who are American Indian will now be able to use
Peyote in their religious services. Federal law permits usage of Peyote by
members of the Native American Church.

GANG JOURNALISM. (parts taken from June '97 Spy Magazine. (read the whole!))
   "My first memory of gymnastics dates from 1972, when at age 11 I was
ensorcelled by the spectacle of Olga Korbut- that 88 pound, rearview 
mirror dingle-dangle of a girl- exposing ass, then lack-of-tit, then ass
again, as she revolved end-over-end across the mat. The Munich Games may
have been marked by a hideous terrorist outrage, but for my febrile 11-year
old sexuality, the hostage taken was my quivering little prick.
   Looking now at photographs of Korbut, I find it impossible to recreate 
any sense of sexual attraction. Rather, I feel like Hunter S. Thompson's
Samoan attorney: "Why should I fuck children? They're too small.""

you. (no I don't owe Spy favors!!!) Men, women, others, you will all 
appreciate it. Guarantee.)
   "What it comes down to is this: either as a society, we've taken another 
step towards a noble, ancient-Egyptian-style civilization, or, as seems
much more likely, every man, woman and child among us has become a vile,
pustulating pedophile."
   -- Damon Trent. Same series. Poppy Z Brite  takes on the "Oval Offspring."

Prime,
 you mentioned in one of the ATIs that the manifesto printed in the 
 washington post was not the complete text.  where can i down load the 
 complete manifesto from?

Here's a new movie in limited release that might interest some of you:
- TIMOTHY LEARY'S DEAD - A documentary punctuated by interviews with
  the LSD guru. Timothy Leary, Dr. Richard Alpert, Dr. Ralph Metzner.
  Directed by Paul Davids. (LA & NYC)

(the following is continuation of Marco's Guide to the Unabomber's
Manifesto. Basically the paragraphs that prime thought were more important
than those NYTIMES and WASHPOAST (sic) chose.)(better explanation next 
issue)
184. Nature makes a perfect counterideal to technology for several reasons.
Nature... is the opposite of technology... Most people will agree that
nature is beautiful; certainly it has tremendous popular appeal. The radical
environmentalists ALREADY hold an ideology that exalts nature and opposes
technology... It is not necessary for the sake of nature to set up some
chimerical utopia of any new kind of social order. Nature takes care of
itself: It was a spontaneous creation that existed long before any human
society, and for countless centuries many different kinds of human societies
coexisted with nature without doing it any excessive amount of damage...

What if they staged a war and all the soldiers were on tripledip???
