One says to the other, 
"Good thing I'm wearing this titanium helmut,
Or else all my sea men would fall out."

Prime here, with another issue of ATI. Actively Trollupping,
Indiscriminately. #121. Saturnday. March 21, 1998. 10:07 pm.
I'm going to begin with an essay I wrote my
junior year of high school. I never published it because I thought it
was one of the most hair-brained, stupid, unintelligent, dumb, idiotic,
silly, (anyone got a thesaurus?) but then all of a sudden I started 
reading about what the Pentagon has been telling Clinton he should do
about places like Iraq, Bosnia, Panama, Honduras, Cuba, etc. 
First there was M.A.D., then Pentagon's suggestions to Clinton last week,
now this:
        EVERYONE CAN LIVE HAPPILY TOGETHER, HERE'S HOW.
                    by Marco Highschooler. 1980.
                    (and you don't even have to pay me for this idea.)

No one listened to my first policy. (military passivity.) They all seem
still to think a nuclear war is winnable. It is.

But, a nuke-war is NOT survivable. Who's gonna give a toot who won?
"Who won, Henry?" "I dunno, I can't see, Margaret. My eyes are ripped
out of my head. And, all my skin is falling off my arms."

I say we use a new policy. Instead of trying to send missiles with 
Plutonium and radium presents to neighboring countries; why don't we
blow ourselves up.

I don't mean literally. The threat itself is more than enough. Let's all
agree to set all the nukes we have right now to blow up right where they
set. (no travel time needed. No interception possible.) Then invite all
our neighbors, enemies, friends, associates to come over and look at what
we're ALL in for.

We will be "those crazy Americans" again. Just like Nagasaki days. No 
one will have the guts to upset us in any way. If we think someone is 
being bad, we are prepared to destroy the entire planet.

Voila, we are suddenly the World Power again. And if other countries
are bright enough to catch on, "More the merrier." This is something that
is no trouble sharing.

There will be no need to spend another penny on defense. We can already
destroy the entire planet at least three times by ourselves. The money
we save on defense could be spent on education, food, housing, medical
expenses, etc.

Peace man, it can work. You're the only one left in the way of our plan.
Please consider it. 



DRESSES UP HIS DECISION Reprinted from TAP magazine.
Mount Clemens, Mic. Mar. 7 (AP) - Three youths who pleaded guilty
to singing Christmas carols in the nude have been ordered by a court
to clean up their act and do an encore next year.
   Putting aside the maximum penalty of $100 or 90 days in jail,
District Court Judge Harry Burkart deferred judgement until next January,
if the teenagers agreed to refrain from streaking during their probation
and return to the same neighborhood next Christmas to do caroling,
but this time in proper attire.

I am new to the Internet and beginning to think of it as a vast, 
very vast waste land.
I stumbled upon you by dumb luck and I made sure to add you to my 
bookmark so I would not lose you. Thank God I found like thinking

One of the most informative websites on the internet.  
I check it daily since I discovered it about 3 weeks ago.  
Thank you for the "inside trek" to progessive thought in the U.S.

Get your thinking straight, man! Like so many utopians, 
past and present, you choose to blindsight yourself of one little thing:  
Human Nature!   Forget your dream, especially the
"common" part, and contribute to the real world.

Your website is truly a front page for the Internet -- 
hope to see what else you have to offer!

The phollowing parody is brought to you by Band Width Savors, LLC.
to the tune of WHEN YOU WORE A TULIP.
(note only one word has been changed, shifting the entire meaning
of the song...)

When you wore a tulip, a sweet yellow tulip,
And I wore a big red nose,
When you caressed me, 'twas then Heaven blessed me,
What a blessing, no one knows.
You made life cheery when you called me deary,
'Twas down where the blue grass grows,
Your lips were sweeter than julep
When you wore that tulip
And I wore a big red nose.

FLASK - Washington. DC (PAWN) wired by prime anarchist world news 2nite.
IT IS NOW SAFE TO LOVE VIDAL.
Gore Vidal addressed National Press Club yesterday in the "springtime of
[his] senility."
   "Crisco Kid ain't no friend of mine," he warned them about Proctor & 
Gamble's abuse of everything from workers, to cows to Monopoly pieces.
   "If I were optimistic I would propose civil war," he said, "but I wont."
   "George Washington's sword would be half way through this pudgy
prosecutor," he said, calling Kenneth Star a "tomboy."
   "I can't get her address," he said about some woman. I have no idea who
he was describing. "I think she works for ITT. He was describing how 
difficult it has been for him to get ahold of the people who run ITT.

AN OPEN LETTER TO GORE VIDAL:
   Hey bub. I can't find your address. I KNOW you don't work for schITT.
Where are you Gore??? I want to write you and thank you for your very 
existence. Were it not for pundits like you, Howard Zinn, HST, and
your cousin, er uh, I mean cousin-in-law, Tipper, I'd've slit my ankles
so many years ago today.


Amiga, amiga, fun for a girl or a boy.
Did any of you catch the new Izuzu ad? 
They begged, borrowed or stole the Slinky (tm)
commercial. 
Highly funny. Funny, funny.
Catchy. Very. Almost seems like their response to
Volkswagen's new improved Beetle. I'm not sure of this, just
a gut feeling.

And she came down out of the clouds in a silver 6-cylander Trooper,
by Izuzu. She said "you shall be the Eagles, with an A."
POW!!! kAbLaM. Flaming Pies everywhere.
