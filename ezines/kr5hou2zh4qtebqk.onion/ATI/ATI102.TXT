The End of Me
                              by Cheryl Irvine.
Blood boils
  [Thoughts of manslaughter
      quickly provoked]
Creases form
[Anger overwhelms
      beyond belief]
Eyebrows disfigure
[Rage takes over
     my once quiet soul]
Eyes snare
[Fury dominates
--grows out of control]
Nostrils flare
 [Revenge is
no longer an option]
Nerves tangle
 [She transformed---
    humane to merciless]
Lips distort
[Irritation conquers
the calmness]
Teeth clench
 [Tightness inside
   is unbearable]
Hands constrict
     [The wheel
 chokes from its own master]
Sweat dribbles
    [The wheel can't take it-
 gagged, strangled]
"Stop!" it screams.
"You don't know what
you're doing!  Please stop!"
Pause.  Close your eyes.
Become free.
Remember who you are...
Inhale.  Exhale.
 Come back to us.
Your body needs you...

Damn those who cut me off
 and don't use their signal.

FROM YALE TO JAIL The Life Story of a Moral Dissenter
David Dellinger
an inspired/inspiring bookreview by Noam Chomsky.
(Lifted by Prime Anarchist from Fortkamp catalog
    1-800-43-peace       rosehill@iw.net
Typed in by Data Entry. The AnaKlerk.)

 The son of a well-to-do Boston lawyer, David Dellinger
seemed cut out for a distinguished career in law or gov-
ernment. But rejecting his comfortable background, he
walked out of Yale one afternoon during the Great Depress-
ion, in his oldest clothes and without any money, to ride
the freight trains, sleep at missions, and stand in bread
lines. Dave lived among the poor in Newark, was bloodied
in the freedom marches through the South, and led
countless hunger strikes in jail. Always, he reached out to
his antagonist to find common ground.
 Dave's memoirs shed new light on many of the most
crucial events of the 1960's. His inside account of what
happened in those years, and of the people who shaped
that decade - Martin Luther King, Jr., Abbie Hoffman,
Bayard Rustin, A. J. Muste, Dorothy Day, Jerry Rubin,
Joan Baez, and many more - is an indispensable chapter
in the story of our time.

*Before reading this book, I knew and greatly admired Dave
Dellinger. Or so I thought.   After reading his remarkable
story, my admiration changed to something more like awe.
There can be few people in the world who have crafted
their lives into something truly inspiring.
This autobiography introduces us to one of them with the
simplicity and integrity that have characterized everything 
Dave has done.*

The Invitation 


by Oriah Mountain Dreamer (a Native American Elder)
                           ((not sure what tribe))


It doesn't interest me what you do for a living.
I want to know what you ache for,
and if you dare to dream of meeting your heart's longing.

It doesn't interest me how old you are.
I want to know if you will risk looking like a fool for love,
for your dreams, for the adventure of being alive.

It doesn't interest me what planets are squaring your moon.
I want to know if you have touched the center of your own sorrow,
if you have been opened by life's betrayals or
have become shriveled and closed from fear of further pain!
   
I want to know if you can sit with pain, mine or your own,
without moving to hide it or fade it or fix it.
   
I want to know if you can be with joy, mine or your own,
if you can dance with wildness and let the ectasy fill you
to the tips of your fingers and toes without cautioning us to be 
careful, be realistic, or to remember the limitations of being human.
  
It doesn't interest me if the story you're telling me is true.
I want to know if you can disappoint another to be true to yourself;
if you can bear the accusation of betrayal 
and not betray your own soul.  

I want to know if you can be faithful 
and therefore be trustworthy.

I want to know if you can see beauty 
even when it is not pretty every day,
and if you can source your life from God's presence.
   
I want to know if you can live with failure, yours and mine,
and still stand on the edge of a lake 
and shout to the silver of the full moon, "Yes"!

It doesn't interest me to know where you live 
or how much money you have.
I want to know if you can get up after the night of grief and despair,
weary and bruised to the bone, and do what needs to be done 
for the children.
 
It doesn't interest me who you are, how you came to be here.
I want to know if you will stand in the center of the fire with me 
and not shrink back.
 
It doesn't interest me where or what or with whom you have studied.
I want to know what sustains you from the inside 
when all else falls away.
  
I want to know if you can be alone with yourself,
and if you truly like the company you keep in the empty moments.

STATISTICS    by Aaron K.   (prime note: oops. two submissions. 
                             This one I was late getting to)

"It has been taught very poorly", our teacher says
as we silently nod in all knowing agreement that 
he is far too right remembering the question we got 
right on our assignment, that he marked wrong
that he refuses to admit

Soaked from surprisingly fierce wind driven early morning rains
whose vigour I'd felt not worthy of my coat
I sit in the air conditioned room and watch a classmate pickup 
and put on his jacket questioning yet again the sanity and 
intentionality of whomever sets the temperature
Who're ignoring today's forecasted twenty degree drop

Labouriously working through ever excruciating detail of an 
example which, having unusually studied for class, I find, 
as they like to say in math: trivial
Watching the red glow of light emitting diodes on the 
digital clock, trying to catch the numbers change 
without the prof noticing

classmate returns from blowing his nose
I'm still wet and our best linear predictor is incapable of 
understanding the logic of the temperature gods and their 
reasons for trying to give colds to hundreds
of students on the week of mid-terms
Sniff, Sniff.

I used to like math.

"It has been taught very poorly," he said.
Today was not an exception.
