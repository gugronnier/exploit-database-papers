                         ISSUE: 10

11 actually came out before this one.
We waited a great deal of time for 
this one while attempting to unscramble
it with a sector editor. This was going
to be our second 80 column issue, and
our first Amiga issue, but I guess it's
back to the old 8bit atari.

Oh well.    ()()()()()()()()()()()

A lot of people are complaining about
the ascii formatting of my T-Philes.
Most people ask what kind of commodore,
err, computer I use. Yes, I have an
old 8bit atari, but that isn't the
problem at all. I found out an hour
ago that it's my modem. And my dip
switches look like this:

             >-----------------<
         alligator   :      alligator
           clip      :        clip
                   bell     
                   wire.

AND I'M NOT TOUCHIN 'EM UNLESS SOMEONE
LENDS ME A 12 OR 24 HUNDRED BAUD
MODEM IN CASE I SCREW IT UP BIGTIME.

  The only other complaint I'm hearin,
is the 40 column format. I'm sorry, but
until EVERY computer hosts 80 columns
I will publish at 40 columns. If you
want an 80 column issue, get out your
favorite text editor or word processor.
  At any rate, if you find yourself 
unable to read these issues, try 
downloading them another way, or from
another board. Some sysops have 
changed the format using some program
that's out there. When I find out what
the name of the program is, I'll
publish it here, and/or publish names
of boards now and then where it's 
formatted properly.
  FLASH!!! WHO IS THE BAND THAT DID
THE REMAKE OF LED ZEPPELIN'S "LIVIN
LOVIN MAID"? Sounds like Fatboys, but
it sounds awesome.
       NOTAS MUSICAS!!!

  To the tune of "Frito Bandito" 
commercial: Aye, Aye, Aye, Aye.

When stuck between two lousy choices
ie: Bush/Duke, US/SU, Coke/Pepsi,
MacDonalds/BurgerKing-- I always say
choose BEER

"Dunno, I was cocked".

"Little" Steven Van Zandt told me
last April that SPIN was really about
the only worthwhile RockRag to check
out any more. I guess he was just as
angry with Hit Parader, Cream, and
Rolling Stone as I was. I didnt 
notice so obviously until this month.
(sept 88 issue) (the one with Traci
Chapman on the cover... you know, the
black chick with the nappi hair)
  Anyways, here's a few thoughts from
various musicians I decided to
highlight for you in case you cant get
out and steal a copy or buy it maybe.
(I did)
HOLLY NEAR: If you write a generic
peace song that just talks about peace
and kindness, there is more of a 
tendency for them to be accepted than
if you really propose solutions or if
you put forward some kind of analysis
of what is causing war or racism or 
sexism.
  You saw that when Little Steven was
doing much more specific things about
south africa. It was alright to feed
the africans, but when we talked about 
actually wanting the africans to 
liberate themselves and take control
of their own countries, then it was
less of a hit than the humanitarian
concept of just feedin the poor african
peoples.
BILLY BRAGG: For some artists, being 
political is what sells their record,
for good or bad. Certainly my 
audience is based on political stuff.
Nobody ever asks me what guitar strings
I use or what I was doing in my next
video. They all want to know when I am
going to think of a good rhyme for 
"socialism".
PETER GABRIEL: I really hope youngpeople get a sense that they CAN make
a difference in what is going on. I
think that isthe most important thing-
that they dont feel victims of the
world; that they feel in charge of the
world, because it's theirs to inherit.
NONA HENDRYX: to me, the basic problem
is to continue. Not only for the artist
to do it but the audience or the people
who are listening to stay involved. Not
only on the large level, but on the
small level, in your community, your
neighborhood, your state.
MERLE HAGGARD: was always necessary.
From the time I was in the fourth, 5th
grade, it would be on my report cards,
only the teachers would call it staring
out the window. But what I was doing
was trying to write songs.
JACKSON BROWN: A door was kicked open
with Band Aid and Live Aid so that you
saw a little bit of the rest of the 
world. Then the door opened a little
further when you saw that there was 
apartheid in south africa. Now the door
has really been kicked wide open
because you see that our government is
involved in a lot of things like 
selling arms to Iran, trading arms for
hostages, and diverting money 
illegally to wars that really can only
be called private wars now.
LITTLE STEVEN: In the media, that's 
where the battle is. that's where the
communication is going on -- where
the public opinion is going to be
effected. That's were education is
going to take place. 
  Any of you who attended the 
Rutgers Conventin last spring will
remember the seminar called Media, 
Modem, and Music put on by Abbie 
Hoffman, Marc Greenberg, and Little
Steven. They dealt with a revolution
in the music industry,
(and moreso the WHOLE media industry)
saying a major change was on its way.
These quotes, and many others in last
month's SPIN just grabbed my attention,
and made me think that change might be
already powerfully on its way. 
(especially if you heard any of Traci
Chapman's other (pronounced "not played
on the radio statons)) songs.
  At any rate, I didnt mean for this
article to make sense as a whole. It
was more or less a collage, of musical
stuff that might get you grabbin your
acoustic; or hopefully your million
watt marshall stack. cause this shit
has GOT to get out.
s/
prime.

FAH-Q'S CORNER.................

Well here we are in Indianapolis. ATI
had to go on vacation and just get
away from the local secret service...
I mean the police. This place is great.
I am checking for 1800 divertors from
my hotel room.
  You can do all kinds of schitt from
a hotel room phone. When we checked
in they never asked for id so I told
them I was Phillip Regular. They gave
us a room in the exec section when I
told them I ran a newspaper. The room
cost 33 a night with a bottle of wine.
Well to get back to the phone. In this 
hotel they have a system that can dial
direct to another room, just by dialing
a 3 digit number. Well when I checked 
in the clerk told me I had to dial 0
and tell the desk I wanted an outside
line. Well there is no dialtone on 
these fones, so it must be dead til you
dial a #. Well I was in 136, and my
friends were in 135. I dialed their #
to tell them to wake up. When they hung
up I got a dialtone. I dialed 0 for the
desk but instead I got an operator from
Indiana Bell. I called the office to
get a printout of all the calls from
this room and they said there WERE no
calls. I dont know how that happened
but I'm uploading this phile from the
fone in my room right now and I'm not
paying for it, I can assure you.

We found the rastafarians here in Indy.
They are hanging around the courthouse
handbilling. I lost mine, ut it said
along the lines: laws for pot and
the constitution grants freedom of
religion, and their religion called for
weed. So they should be able to use it
in religions practice. They have been
fighting for reform for 5 years here
in indy because there is a big order of
jamaicans and others who practice here 
in indy.

?

I asked crash to marry me lastnite. She
said yes. We will tell you when the 
wedding is. If I get everything set and
get an apartment and stuff, the Prime
Anarchist'll be the best man. I havent
told him yet, so you know before he
does.

Goodbye from Indy
the next trip will be to 
hawaii on my honeymoon
so listen for the hula issue

Fah-Q 
    Live from INDY.

Oh, the speed limit here is 65. For 
those of you who live in a 65 zone, the
cops'll let you get away with 75-80
most of the time. They set their radar
at 82 so you have a 17 mph leeway.

bye

Saw a neat ad on TV for Citibank 
(criminals they are!!!)
  It was a customer discussing her
card's abuse, and how helpful citi-
corpse was thru it all. They told her
she wasnt responsible for the $200
amigas, sneekers, fonesex, etc, that
likely showed up on her fonebill.
  "Had it been another company besides
citibank, it would've been ME doing the
talking..."
  Ha.
  As if some other company would be
different. Gimme a break. YOU ARE 
RESPONSIBLE TO THE 1st $50 OF FRAUD
AND THAT'S IT!!!
  To report a lost or stolen card, 
call 1800-336-0046. I say call them
at least once a day. Make up some 
names and addresses.
  "I dont remember the account #; can
you look it up?"
  FLASH!!! I JUST DIALED IT AT 5AM AND 
GOT NO ANSWER. GAVE UP AFTER 130 RINGS.
IMAGINE THAT. MY CARD GOT STOLEN AND
I CAN'T GET AHOLD OF THEM TO CANCEL IT.
GIVES MY BURGLAR THAT EXTRA TIME TO
PLAY AROUND WITH my CARD!!!
  Put those detectives to work.

SUGGESTION OF THE MONTH: above 
cigarette machines and stuff in all the
stores, you'll see APPLICATIONS to
credit cards, motor clubs, vacation
getaways, magazines, and assorted
stuff. (especially citicorpse stuff)
  Send in about 30 or so. Blank?
Inaccuracies? Full of swears? etc...
