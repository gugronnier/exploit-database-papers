Canada eating out Mexico.
Virtual orgy.
Everybody trucking everybody else.
None of the "No-view-riche" knowing who to thank;
But all of the poor of the 
Poorest of the poor certainly
Knowing who to blame.

Money, perhaps at the root of all obscenity.
Insanity.
Nympho-consumero-expando-destructo-maniacs abound.
And the environment?
Do the words "suffer bitch," come to mind?

LETTERS TO ATI:
Wishing you peace and love...

From: Ali Shehzad Zaidi 


If the dance of the peacock can bring forests of desire, orchards of
fulfillment, into being, if the ghost dance of the Lakota can transfigure
the landscape with ancestral memory, then fusing our horizons into
history
we can remove from our universities this blight of statistics and
mendacity
and corporate logos and smiling men in suits. For an education that is a
shared adventure, not an ordeal of solitary confinement, for a human
condition in which we have fallen in love, for what The University wanted
to
be before it ever was, for the messages sieved from the prophetic sea of
images in our midst, for the moon that replenishes this night: restore
the
imagination to our curricula -- our very lives. 

             In other words, revolution now.

                                                        Ali

Prime Anarchist World News.

               This one swiped from the Onion:

        NEW YORK--A spokesperson for the letter D announced Monday that 
the #3 consonant is withdrawing sponsorship from Sesame Street following a 
Children's Television Workshop announcement that a homosexual muppet will 
soon join the show's cast. 
        "The letter D is proud to have brought you many wonderful Sesame 
Street episodes throughout the program's 28-year history," said Patricia 
Willis, public-relations director for D. "But the letter D
does not condone the sort of morally questionable lifestyles that 
Sesame Street is advocating with the introduction of this new character. 
It can no longer in good conscience associate itself with the show." 
        Willis said D's withdrawal is effective immediately, and applies 
to both capital and lower-case versions of the letter. 
        The gay muppet, "Roger," will be introduced on Sesame Street 
Dec. 23, CTW director Leslie Charren said. Thus far, no other sponsors 
have pulled out, though the number seven has requested an
advance tape of the episode before it makes a decision.         
        Many public-television insiders believe D's withdrawal was 
motivated by a desire not to alienate religious conservatives, 
a section of the population that employs the letter frequently. 
        "D is for, among other things, demagoguery, dogma and doctrine, 
words crucial to right-wing groups like the Christian Coalition," said 
Yale University political-science professor J. Wright Franklin. 
        "It is likely that D felt it could ill afford to offend such a 
large segment of its users." 
        While a long-term replacement for D has not yet been secured 
by Sesame Street, the number three will temporarily fill in for it 
in a number of the show's animated shorts. Other pieces will simply 
skip from C to E, with vocalists stretching out C into two syllables 
to match the rhythm of the alphabet song. 
        Sesame Street is stung by the sudden departure of its longtime 
supporter. Speaking to reporters, cast member Cookie Monster said: 
"Me disappointed letter D choose to end relationship with Sesame Street 
due to pressure from extremely vocal minority. We accused of endorsing 
deviant lifestyle. Me say homosexuality natural, not immoral. 
Diversity and enrichment. That good enough for me."

PAWN /Washingmachineton/  ALL US TROOPS WILL BE INOCULATED AGAINST ANTHRAX.
        The largest peace-time boat-lift on-going in US history.
        "Not since Joesph Smith canoed three Hopi and 7 Navajo down
the Rio Grande, has a larger percentage of a population voluntarily
undergone tic-bite treatments," said Joseph Biafra, of CDC.
        Four ships a day will port off Plum island, L.I for the next seven
months, while soldiers, sailors and marines undergo 3 days and 4 nites
each of beer-drinking, carousing and letting ticks bite them in hopes 
that they will catch anthrax, according to Biafra.   
        "Thems that live'll be thems that make us stronger," said 
Connecticut Governor John Jacob Rovland at a recent rock concert held
to raise funds for the Long Island Island.

As a wayward boy rides a 10-speed bike
To put a couple quarters in a video game.
Now a 5-dollar token holds a promise of gold.
Trading up for a limosine ride.

People putting up their homes for sale
Saying they're so fed up you know
Not sellin low to the local folk,
Holding out 'til the price comes up.

To self-serve gas and cast a lot.
Ten in the tank and a lottery scratch.
To see if he can hit a jackpot.

2 wait while daddy goes for snake eyes or doubles.

A jail cell locks up voting machines
Along with a baseball betting book
2 of a kind beats a Royal Flush
When the loser gets a recount took.

Abused greyhound from the plainfield lot
Says gambling is Satan's root
But she'll cocktail wait making loose ends meet.

JOURNAL POEM 33
Dedication: Juan & Edgar: Father & Son.

Nothing rhymes with viener schnitzel
3 turtles walk gardenward out
Of the north seeking vegetation.
Heyoka moon wanes. 3 questions:
Must war tear every square
Foot of the earth?
When will the blood stop spilling??
Who left out Revelation to John 22:22???

So there we were thinking,
"Here we are."

Direct non-violent confrontation
Door County should make
Cherry flavored potato chips.
Can't taste as bad as the trees smell.

Cinco de Mayo
 Carbon monoxide
  Deisel truck drives by
   Jogger coughs once more;
    Rain makes it smell worse
     Sick to his stomach
      May 5th - his first run.

Washing hands and face in the lower
Spring each morning -- a good time
To see animal tracks.
Surely you share this spring.
Turn thirty really close to the
Vernal equinox while de-icing the
Windshield at LaGuardia airport.
Hyssop cleans the temples.
Mall full of beer-bellied men
& anorexic-looking women makes for
Feeling sick and sorry for society.
Mecca and mime sit silently saying, "..."

Polka Haiku:
Learning new songs on
Accordian, guitar, voice,
Reworking old ones.

Gadzookamaluga!
Chubbs says he's waiting
For Vatican III in 3-D.
"So what's a soy rabbi?" I ask
Receiving lesson about the over-
Specializing of everything american.
"I'm in charge of health foods,"
He says, "herbs, anything to do with

What's good for you -- shampoo's
Soaps, etc."
Oy, soy rabbi.

Wisconsin. Like a borscht
Without brussels sprouts.
