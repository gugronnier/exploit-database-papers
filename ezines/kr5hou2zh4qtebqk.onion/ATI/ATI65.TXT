Ati 65
ALL THE NEWS THAT FITS, WE PRINT

It's Sunday. February, 2, 1997.
ATI 64 has gone out to about 45 people. If you know someone who oughta get this,
lemme know. Or tell them to either search for it thru Yahoo & Hotbot (the 2 biggest "hitters"
 I know about so far) or give me an email address to send it to. I'll do the rest.
Don't expect the price for ATI to go up this year to offset cost of living increases. (besides
I don't drink COLAs anymore anyhow.) Any percentage increase from 0 is still 0, so you
pay $0.00 to receive Activist Times, Inc. as per usual.

Which leads me to this:
Notas Prime Anarchos: if anyone's charging you to receive ATI, please either:
1)let me know.
2)ask them to cut it out. or
3)pay for it and ask them to send a portion to me.

THE BALLAD OF KEROUAC AND FARRAKHAN
                                             by marc harry ehrenfrucht

Statesman, poet, traveler man.
Kerouac and Farrakhan.
Teacher, leader, writer more-
Well dressed, learned, both adored.
One keeps getting called militant
Other left Navy and Merchant Marines--
		they called him a miscreant.

Like Kerouac and Farrakhan, man.
Like Kerouac man, and Farrakhan.
Farrakhan, like Kerouac man... wait.
Kerouac practically IS Farrakhan.

Louis Eugene Walcott was born in 1933.
Jean Louis Lebris Christened 1922, you see.
Louis Eugene got his start in  the Bronx of NYC.
Went to live in Boston, Mass. The part called Roxbury.
Jean Louis went the other way beginning in Lowell, Mass.
Prep school took him to New York for Columbia, where he could barely pass.

Jean Louis the well groomed football star 
Became Jack Kerouac, sometimes John.
Louis Eugene the well groomed track star
Became Louis X, then Louis Abdul Farrakhan.
Oh, also known as Calypso Gene, The Charmer
Toting a guitar, wrote many a country song.
Kerouac didn't do as well in school,
But many a poem he wrote, and sometimes rather long.
They say Louis stuttered as a child, honor roll though in school.
Someone said Kerouac rather than writing was a typer
Drove him wild, dropped out twice from Columbia, one Prof. called him fool.

Louis is reputedly awesome on the violin I hear,
Kerouac read his poems as if voice were saxophone in your ear.
Louis is son of a Baptist preacher, attended Episcopal,
Now leads US Nation of Islam
Jack attended Catholic schools made Zen all the rage-
	-Posthumous father of the whole beat field of 
	-Disembodied poetry.

Ah,  crescendo. No more rhyme scheme, follow this now.
Farrakhan plays a 200 year old Guadagnini violin,
While Kerouac banged on a 100 year old Underwood Type-O-Matic.
Like Kerouac and Farrakhan, man.
Like gods with words.

WEISENHEIMER AND COMPRESSIONISM: A New Satirical Theme and Variation Chapter for Joseph Machlis' textbook, "The Enjoyment of Music."
	By Marc Frucht

	"Kill all cops,"   --Warm Milk
	"Kill all lawyers," Shaquil Wilhelm (a.k.a. W. Shakespeare)

	In 2005 Marc Weisenheimer, folk singer and classical comedian, listened to a Black & Decker air compressor and contemplated the new music. The term "alternative" was fast growing old, and so was Weisenheimer. Never satisfied with the title youth had given him: "Founding Father of Generation X" he was searching for a new name to call himself, as well this new movement afoot that went far beyond Post-Modernism. The popular form included MTV re-runs, paintings of dried nasal mucus on high-priced canvasses, poems about slamming Spam and diets that require eating solely gefilte fish for four days, followed by three days of milkshakes and healthy dinners, repeated four times each month. This is now called the "rubber ball diet."
	"What will we call ourselves???" shouted Weisenheimer in the midst of a desperate quest of desperate despair. "There's nothing left!!!"
	And then it hit him. Actually he almost hit it. He'd stubbed his Miata 4-door alloy-mobile on an entire condominium made of particle board.
	"That's it," he thought out loud, "I'll call it 'Compressionism.'" He said something about smooshing everything up from thousands of years and rehashing it out every artistic orifice and just about "begging" for it to be called "Compressionism" and so a whole genre was born. Or at least named.
THE COMPRESSIONIST PAINTERS
In 1996 Brutus Gangreich proposed canceling all National Endowment for the Arts stipends and proverbial hell broke loose.
	"Anarchy," said Puerto Rico School of Design professor Denise Homogeno, "no one had and money," said the PRISD professor, "so they began  making art out of just whatever was lying around. Everything." she said no medium had been left "uncoated."
	Artist Tish "The Wet" Sponge best represents Compressionist painting even though she was born considerably earlier that Compressionism's advent. Born in 1958, the Hell, Pennsylvania native was raised in 1970 and claims to have "soaked up all [her] inspiration in expensive  coffee houses and poetry slams."
	"I just look at it all, think it over while slurping coffee, and then snot on the canvas," she explains. She pays a lot for canvas, but politically correct environmentalists will please to know that she doesn't use aerosols or other toxic waist to coat her art for setting. She simply spills her coffee refill over it in three even coats and chants the now-famous mantra, "I'll sue, I'll sue, I'll sue."
	Painters all over America and parts of the world calling themselves Compressionist must master the craft of coffee-spilling before going out from their salad days.
	One place besides Hell where much Compressionism is being studied is in Seminole, Virginia. John Elston started the Virginese school in an old abandoned catholic monastery in neighboring Virgin, Virginia. Any Compressionist mucus paintings bearing the stamp "made in Virgin," "Crafted by Virginese," or "Seminole Made," command thousands at auction before the painters are even famous.
	Red King of the alternative band Roomful of Pavement is most famous for his painting work before joining the band because he attended the virginese school as a child and then went on to paint houses with his popular mucus primer. King's "Canvas snottings" (as he calls them) can get him no less than half a million sometimes.
	Some other painters working in the Compressionist movement are Muriel Weddinghaus (1982-2005) Heinrick "All-U-Can-Eat" Buffet (1937-1992, Eric Tenuta (1985-present) and Johannes Smithenstein (1999-pres.)
	They took studio painting out of the studio and into the coffee shop, or wherever else mucus art could  be produced. Instead of mixing their pigments on the pallet it was all done in their heads, unrehearsed, unsketched, spontaneous and spur-or-the-moment.
	There's also a sub movement these years called "pulp fiction" where similar paintings are done right on pieces of particle board but they seldom get more than a couple hundred dollars, no matter who made them. Even if they came from Virgin.

Much wiser than he. And we know Flipper lives in a world full of wonder,
Lying there under, under the sea.

Happy and gay, when he comes along. They all start singing this song.
They call him Flipper...

Bewitched, bewitched. you know your craft so well,                        That started from this tropic port
