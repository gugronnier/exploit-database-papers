here's the poem I just wrote 
(hope you don't mind my sharing it with you all): 
A lonely walk across the crowded beach. 
The laughing cries of playful children, 
Echoing in the empty recesses of my heart. 
Even the sea gulls avoid me, 
With my stigmata of the loner. 
A cure I sought, to this solitude. 
So I joined a club for people like me. 
Now I sit alone, 
In a place For the emotionally homeless.

(why do I get the feeling he's making fun of John Entwhistle???)

OK, Prime here to tell you -- another OpEd.
   "Uh oh," I say, "Clinton's got a new puppy
named Buddy. He'll be impeached soon.
   "Checkers, Willie," I say. "You the man." Won't be anything
the Republicans are doing. They keep failing to "nail" him 
like a CIA operative on Castro. Let's see. It took Nixon about
3 years to get impeached after he was "tooken" in by those 
cute wide puppydog eyes. Bill? In these high tech, quick-paced
page-me-and-I'll-cell-phone-your-voice-mail times? 
   A year. Two max. Start a pool? 
   No pap #'s run today. And no Calendular. Get that mid-jan at
a webzine surfshop near you. Tons of submissions today. I can 
glide. My dreams seem to be coming to fruition. Or at least 
multiplying, anyhow. I pulled all last month's submissions off
the junomail system before NUKING it. So you're in for a treat
today. 
   Don't forget though, send all further contribs to 
ati@etext.org   
or leave it in one of the guestbooks. If you
send correspondence to 
marco99@juno.com
who knows who might get it now. Is there such thing as a 
dead-letter office in cyberland? Hmmm. Go to school on 
that one, eh?

This one's called Prince Albert
dedicated to the Royal American Guard.
Written by Dwarka Chavez.

Alexandra's hubby knew a joke or two they say.
Both he told at court each time whilst
Grampa drinks his Kurds and whey.
First is the one about the road
Crossed with an eyesore of chicken-
Lastly he'd always take off his shoe and ask it:
D'ya have George in a tin?

He footnotes this: "Prince Albert and Princess 
Victoria were first cousins married 1840.
George III was her father's father."

ECO TERRORIZM 



Pay per view 

Who needs nature anymore 



Pay to poo 

Who needs to dig a hole 

in a forest 



Pay to chew 

Who needs plants to fill our bellies 



When we have irradiated cardboard 

crackers 

Made from cow guts, 

dung 

and chocolate flavored pudding.

WESTCHESTER COYOTE by Jenny McBride
reprinted from other zines.

Came wheeling around the brick wall
of the would be estate
And I thought,
"Someone's shephard mix coming to bark at us."
But it ran sleek into Coyote,
Was the ancient trickster
Setting barbs of longing 
In my heart,
The thrill of longing
For the return of fleet feet
To the plains.
Coyote ran yet watched
As we marveled, suburban scientists.
He whet our lips
We'll do the same for him.
Wilder than road crowding deer on goose.
He is running, yet 
Across a lawn
And into the restored praire
Triumph the moment.

Velkomen to ATI 108 by the way. I hope you like it's 
spontane-80. Or whatever they call that.
Prime proud to announce all this good stuff. That's
about all I'll be doing this week. I oughta just
"mc" each piece, huh? Maybe I'll submit a thing or
two if I see a good spot to put one in, otherwise
what you see is what a bunch of various sundries
put in.
Well, we're into another year. What ELSE can we get
into -- we'll have to see.
        "Cross that bridge when we get..." GHW Bush.
        Was this New Year's "rockin" eve boring or
was I the only one who slept through it? I woke up
feeling such the old man I had to check my beard to
see that it warn't the whole 40 days gone. There 
wasn't even water on the ground. Oh -- different 40
days...
        Well, listen I'm pretty glad I didn't take
Amtrak into the City this year to be honest with you.
        Cutting in on Bob Barker's 19 year old G.F.
during a Spice Girls lipsinc festival is just somehow
not my idea of a good time.
        In fact the city probably looked more like a 
Star Wars alien bar scene than the movie itself! 
Freakazoids all over the place. 
        Glad I missed it. Thank God for Memorex!
Prime outa here.


PAWN- (Rome Again) MICROSOFT AND CATHOLIC AGREE ON MERGER
At a recent press conference Gatlin-Bill Guttierez 
announced a merger between Microsoft, Inc. and the
Catholic (not to be confused with the catholic). 
        "Well, said Bill, "I offered the Pope some of
our cappucino and he traded half of Rome. You should've
seen his eyes all mezmarized-looking.
        Bill said wait 'til we see what Italy's willing
to fork over in exchange for Java.

MACDONALDS OFFERS FREE SEATING
(USA) - In Fierce grueling competition, Mackie D's offered
free seating yesterday; not to be one-upped by Burger King
with their free fries.
        "Free fries???" Quipped Ronald, of PlayLand, "Hah!
What's that get you? 59c??? You can sit in any of our
restaurants, for as long as you want. And it's absolutely
free. Let's see THEM do that."

(DC) - CHIEF JUSTICE GETTING SUPREMELY SOFT ON RACISM
(By CB7. Special to Prime Anarchist World News) 
        "He's alright for a colored," said Chief Justice
William Rankin at a recent stop to a Washington DC, NW
BK for lunch.
        Sources close to the Chief said William Jefferson,
a recent George Washington University graduate was waiting
on their table after this morning's C-SPAN debate implicating
Pat Buckaneen and White House basement official Ann Neutrczisn
when Jefferson asked if Buckaneen wanted coke with his free
fries.
        "You know bi-partisan one-party world-democracy is on 
its way," said Neutrczisn," when the Chief Justice uses
other than the 'N' word for a George Washington University
grad." 
        Rankin could not be reached for comment, but his 
answering machine did say that some of his best friends are
nerds.

A LETTER TO HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON
Dear Mrs. Clinton:
        I am told you are the most respected woman in the United
States right now. Were I still a signal soldier in the US Army,
I would honor you as the wife of my commander in chief. But I
don't.
        I must say with all candor I only voted for you all
because I was downright scared another four more years of Bush
and Reagan would surely ruin this planet beyond repairable
recognition.
        Now to the meat of this rhetoric and then I'll close
with a poem. I will find myself able to have respect for you if
and ONLY IF YOU FREE LEONARD PELTIER.
        I really don't know how you can handle the embarrassment
of calling yourself an American while another brilliant mind sits
tucked away behind nationally chagrined bars, imprisoned merely 
for his views.
        I'm sure you've got a handle on the concept "none of us
free until all are;" I believe that with all my heart.
        Mrs. Clinton, I cannot find more than a handful of 
Americans who still want Peltier "neutralized." But then, maybe
they're who run your life right now.
        So please Mrs. Clinton. Instruct your husband tonite to
stop embarrassing me and finally command my respect by granting 
Peltier his freedom.
        We truly are related,

HERE'S WHY THE CAGED BIRD SINGS:
A Postscript Poem For My Country's Leader.
by Marc Arnold

Here, hear the music of an Auschwitz violin circle.
Hitler loved his music; and so his assistant.
So the jew played Beethoven for seven hours;
Before the assistant killed each musician.
Smiles were everywhere; the music was beautiful.
The caged bird sings because he is allowed.
What song would you like to hear?

SONG-CIRCLE BROADSIDE by Marco Capelli
F-Bb-C   (Kingston Trio-ish)

I was ridin the T this morning and I got bored
And kind of lonely so I picked up a magazine
So I could read it and it was filled with lots of pictures &
words and words and pictures and pictures and typos galore.
And pictures of words and words about pictures
And typos and typos galore.

So I did ride the T this morning and 
I got lonely and kind of bored 
So I had purchased a magazine and it was called STUFF
And it was free so it was filled up with
Stuff and stuff and stuff about stuff
and it was pretty good and I liked it a lot
But many may say that
It was full of fluff.

(ch) Stuff magazine
     Stuff was full of fluff
     Stuff magazine
     Stuff was full of fluff

(spoken after each verse)  (well it's not your Pheonix you know.)
                           (Hey - it's better than the NY papes)
                           (Well it was free so worth it.)
(repeat choruses and verses til people are sick of it and then sing:
                           ("AND THAT'S ABOUT ENOUGH"))

TO THE TUNE O' JIMMY CRACKED CORN

Hillary cracked up -n- I don't care
Hillary cracked up... 
(x3)
The water is white wally wally wally

Newt's been after her for many years.
Newt's been ...
Since a King George inaugaural day

Nafta passed and I don't care
...
Our master's back to stay.

Healthcare's dead 'n I don' care.
...
We all get minimum wage

My team chief's "bi" 'n I don' care.
My sergent's bi 'n I don' care.
My E-6's bi 'n I don't care.
But never preach if you're gay.

'N if you teach any other way
'N if you teach... (x3)
They'll burn your church today.

Democrats 'n Republicans
Republicrats 'n Demicans
3rd party cats and hooligans
Duzzn't really matter much to me.
