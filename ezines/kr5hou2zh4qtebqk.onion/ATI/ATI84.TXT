June 4, '97. a poem by Punkin. Allouez, WI 1997.
Emotionless dehumanization,
Slaves to consumerism;
Sweat stings the naked eye,
And your gut wrenches:
As the sickening smell of
Factory fumes invade your lungs-
The unborn remain so,
Robots not capable of childbirth.
Are you the manufacturer,
Or the manufactured?

    Senate Votes to Block Bomb-Making Info
	   by Rebecca Vesely

	   The Senate has voted 94-0 to tack onto a
	   Defense Department spending bill an amendment that would
	   prohibit the distribution of bomb-making instructions in the 
	   United States.

	   Although the word "Internet" is not mentioned in the four-page
	   amendment, the legislation would outlaw Web sites, newspapers,
	   zines, and books that publish instructions on how to make a
	   bomb - such as The Anarchist's Cookbook and The Terrorist
	   Handbook. Violators would face fines and prison sentences of
	   up to 20 years.

	   Sponsored by Senator Dianne Feinstein (D-California), who has
	   been trying to get the legislation on the books since 1995, the
	   amendment passed Thursday is narrowly written to include only
	   the distribution of material that has an "intent to harm."

Prime Anarchist here. That was reprinted from one of the listservs I'm on.
I thought it had wide apropriateness, if you catch my drift.
The poem before it comes from a new penpal of mine.

Not many letters to the editor this week. Two I couldn't print because I
couldn't read them. Makes me wonder if they were letters to the editor or
hate mail. As usual, address all lettuce to:

Since the railroading of Marcus Garvey, there have been certain 
sinister forces of the United States government who have gone to 
great lengths to deceive, and manipulate the minds of the people. I am 
living proof of what they are capable of.

Since my emancipation, I have been overcome with bitter-sweet emotions. 
After being released from almost a lifetime of imprisonment, I am still 
not completely liberated and cannot be while my comrade, 
Mumia Abu-Jamal, is still a victim of this ongoing collusion.

I can personally attest to his character and integrity. I met him in the 
60s. He was working in the Philadelphia chapter at the time and over 
the years, he has become like a younger brother to me. I urge you, I 
appeal to you all to use that same strength that enabled you to support 
me for almost three decades, and direct it towards Mumia's struggle. 
With your help, I never lost hope, with all of you fighting for me on the 
outside, my spirit was strong enough to sustain everything it needed 
to persevere on the inside.

I thank you for everything you have done for me, and for everything you 
continue to do for Mumia.  Together . . . we will rise above it all.

Peace,

Geronimo

/   Report. Right Pronto.
		I was hoping to report on this within three weeks. But the
response has been so quick so far I'm going to tally this up EVERY WEEK
for three and then go from there. You can say that this literary experiment
worked wonderfully. 
   For those of you just tuning in, what we did was we started last week's
issue with a little piece about Paddle To The Sea the famous 1940's kiddie
adventure novel about a 4-foot long canoe that got dropped off in the great
lakes and "paddled" his way out to the Atlantic Ocean. Complete with map
and everything. Well the experiment was to see how quickly it could make it
to the eastern US seaboard. 
   Was I impressed. Faster than I could've predicted. 2 days, old Paddle 
made his way to the Atlantic Ocean.
   So here it is so far. First report was from Columbus, Ohio. Probably
bumped into that NinaPinSanMary replica they did in '92. Second bullet came
in from Detroit, MI.; no doubt where Paddle must've escaped those big huge
circular saws. Of course if a US Government agent was on his tail and
wanted to make it look like Earth First!ers were to blame s/he could've  
spiked that canoe and all hell would've broke loose, right? But that's 
a whole other story... we won't go there. By they way, Detroit forwarded it
to a webpal in Denver so we await hearing from him or her.
   Next we were told that we reached NYC. Bingo. Atlantic seaboard. Made it.
"But I'm not going to forward it to anyone since I didn't find the content
too interesting." Well at least he was honest. 
   Finally, Ole Paddle made his way to Calgary. "also, loved the poem and
agreed with its perspective," for those of us looking for feedback. I coulda
put that quote in letters to the editor, but decided it fit nicely just here.
   So now I can't wait to see where Paddle ends up next. If you've never
read Paddle To The Sea, by the way, add it to your summer "climb a tree and
read a bunch of new books today" list. You'll find it fun, fascinating
and full of fodder for full-grown adults as well as the little foo-fighters
it was originally written for.

Next is a neat book review. You ready?
"WHO IN HELL...: A Guide To The Whole Damned Bunch," by Sean Kelly & Rosemary
Rogers. 
   Put as succinctly as I can, this book is an alphabetized list of everyone
these authors believe got a reserved seat in "the hot town." The Abyss
perhaps. Including the guy who threw his daughter down a well in a Violent
Femmes album.
   Agamemnon's there, as is Aaron Burr. You'll find Hitler and Mussolini, 
Elpinore's not there. He was just dumb. There's no place in hell for dumb
people, unless they just never learn. That's your ticket to points worse
still than the Abyss. Cerberus is there and also Joan Crawford and Father
Coughlin (who by the way, are since married. Going on 70 years now.) 
Now, George Custer's there and so are the Knights Templar. But where's old
Rough and Longhaired Kit Carson? And Kristoffer Kolumbus for that matter.
OK, so this book is just too politically schmorrect for its own good. But it
was a fun-to-read. 
   Who knows, you might even meet a friend.
   "Thus it appears that even sins go in and out of fashion. It has been five
hundred years since Dante described an Inferno full of alchemists, barrators,
diviners, panderers, simonists, and userers. Where in Hell, we may well ask,
are the NRA lobbyists, urban renewers, strip-miners, (ed: strip-mallers for
that matter) paparazzi, on-line child pornographers, draft dodgers,  
infomercial producers, crack dealers, New Age gurus, tax cheats, self-help
quacks, concentration camp commandants, and causers of gridlock?" (ed: strip-
mallers again???)
   That from the preface of said book. Happy reading.

   If you ever get to Green Bay, WI in your lifetime - not that you'd want
to- but if you ever do, there's a pun waiting for you to drive by.
   Go down Asland, Ave. and then take a right onto Tennis CT.
   I kid you not.
   It's there. Of course this from a town that also has "Easy ST" listed in 
the directory. My friend Rich tells me he grew up there...
