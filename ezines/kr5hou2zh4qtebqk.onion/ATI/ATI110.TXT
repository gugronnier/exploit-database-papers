Hej, Prime Anarchist here. Howda-hek-r-u?
I'm doing great. Today is another day. Hoka Hey!
This is issue 110 of the later greater hakerzine, ATI. 
Arizona Terciary Induces --
broadcasting above ground for almost a year now. Under there
for 8 or 9!!!
Time for a Jello Biafra quote. The one that brought us out!!!
"The time has come to become overt, obvious and in their face.
Hiding will not only get us killed, but keeps us ineffective.
Get bold; get loud."
      There you have it. OK I paraphrased the guy badly, but 
      the sentiment was there so piss off. (did I say that?)
Lessee, what do we have for you 2day besides a wild calendar
and a really chockfulla#'s pap #'s run. No PAWN to speak of
but tons of good poetry. All the submissions missed deadline
this week so look for 'em all next Sunday nite. And just think,
there's still time to make YOURS in by next issue.
Hint, hint, nudge; wink.

Issues are phree in case you didn't already know that.

Shouts to Ray and Matt, two anarchists I just met this afternoon. Keep
the faith. Ashes, ashes all fall down.
(anyone follow THAT reference? The ashes in "pocket full of childrens
songs" refer to brimstone. Yeah, sulfur. You got it. What a morbid
*$%#ing topic for tykes to be trading, eh? So were Grimm and her brothers
the original DeathRockers, or what?????!?!?!?!?!

prime outa here, enjoy the rest of this issue and good luck to the
Green Bay Packers, here's hoping they kicked SF's butt so they can go
"all the way."  Dear Abbie Hoffman, your Bears aren't even close, so
eat your %@$#ing heart out. (Why do the Packers have to beat SF? Because
they're bought and paid for by 3Com!!!) Yuck, feck, blechockaptewey.
              -me voy!-



and now a poetry moment...

THAT RAINBOW TRIBE
  -to JB.   by marc harry ehrenfrucht. April 1996

One day, Amerika is going to hear from Josephine Baker again.
Shuffle along Josie. Flo's just wild about your pussycat -
Chiquita -- that jewel-collared Leopard on your leash.
Dark star, JB, Josie full of grace.
Ponytail, drag at times. Bananas and blackface.
Dixiesteppers, steppin out in birthday suits in Philly.
Moliere, Marilyn, Meir and Liz Minelli.
Turtle Isle don't deserve the likes of our own Maman.
Ukelele Lady floors the King -- Paris sings again.
Booklyn to Budapest, Harlem just for fun.
How many times must we march to Washington???
Haiti, for Ebony, Esquire for her hair
Mary's Congolene Straightener - the Baker Fix if you dare.
Dylan jots of twisted times changing as they will
Dior stays the same - Christian get your fill.
That big old toad is still sitting on the lilipad.
Hefner, Hemingway and Magdalene in Havana with Hildega(r)d.
All God's chillun got wings told old Neil.
Scott and Zelda show it at the Chez Josephine,
Apollo, Cotton Club, Palace Theatre, Plantation -
Cafe Venus Ziggie Flo's Folly.
King Louie's Castle and the Club Liberty.
FDR requests a grand Monacan invitation even the Colonial.
Tennesee's afraid of Walter Winchell's Adolph scene,
Swedish Crown Prince? Cream in Maman's coffee.

Castro admonizes twenty minutes in Hell.
Rainbow niece and nephew and their uncle Fidel.
We are all Josephine Baker's Children.
Chasing a rainbow. Konkin our hair
Anyone ever evicted or adopted anywhere...
Each of us who write or singalong as croon,
Croon, croon crooning on a Zimmerman tune.
All of us have GOT wings.

          FLASH. Packers beat 49rs at 3com stadium!!!
          Garrison Keillor's my only source so far. CBS
          isn't coming in, and AP is crashed. I'll 
          tell you for sure by press-time. But if NPR
          can be counted on, Green Bay has won. Why is
          that so important to me? Like I said. They
          are the Ben&Jerry's of Football. OK I'll 
          admit it. I own stock in the Green Bay 
          Packers. Hell, if they were soccer, I'd own
          three times as much. Hey, just be glad I 
          didn't buy HASBRO!!!

Some know how to use them.
Flying toward the sun whether good or bad
That big old toad is still sitting on the lilipad.
How many times must we
MARCH ON WASHINGTON?    
One day America is gon' hear from
Josephine Baker again.

MISSING SUPERBOWL XXXI AT THE MOVIE THEATRE
     by Marco Capelli

While I watch Bob Dole Hawking
Pepsi, potatoe chips, or police cars,
Ann comes in says,
"Marc, let's go see 'People VS Larry Flint.'"
"I'm in the middle of the Big One," I say.
"And these million dollar ads are holding me by the..."
"Pack is down by a few," she tells me,
"They'll kick butt after half-time, rest is history."
She suggests I go with, to see a real story.
Sure. I unglue my eyes as FOX is making fun of
Hummus.
"We want you to see, 
We want you to see,"
Some eyeglass company 
Tells me.
I ask Ann's grampa to tape the rest and
Head off to the theatre.
After our movie we drive home knowing 
The Pack has won because there's not a 
Street without women beating on passing autos,
Men twirling their shirts like
Amateur strippers, 
And Green Bay of all places,
Fireworks overhead no one can see
Because it's snowing.
The Packers won.
Rest is history.
    Thanks to my ex for real drama...



I MAILED DEATH TODAY    2-12-97
    anonymous

Not a letter bomb
a diploma.
Vellum.
They still use vellum-
My degree will be hellum.
Deep Elem blues, I got them...
Colleges still use vellum?
How many? Any no??
Helluva vellum dilemma.
To vellum or not to vellum:
How many colleges still use vellum?
How many don't?
Will?
Won't.
Will mine give me something else.
Or make me take it.
Can't you fake it? Holy wah!

Wood, hemp, cotton perhaps. Resume bond maybe.
But don't send me my degree
On Sheep. 
or Cow.


OUR ONLY SUBMISSION THIS WEEK CAME SNAILMAIL.

CAT FOOD TUNA AND MAYONAISE.
     by Leon (401)    1996.

An old woman walks into a RI Cumberland Farms,
Steals 2 gallons of milk, a hot dog
Rolling on an electric spit, an apple pie,
2 bunches of bananas, a pound of
Pre-packaged hamburger,
2 dozen donuts and an apple fritter.

All that she can carry quickly.

Another old woman enters
After the other left. She looks left, right.
She's 5'3" tall, according to the red and blue
Hold-up-measuring-door-jam-device.
Passes over the milk -- whole refrigerator
Section in fact. 
Touches a bun, thinks better of a hotdog.
Looks up and down the Hostess (tm)
Pie rack shaking her head saying,

Sugar, sugar, sugar.
She repositions 3 bananas the 
First woman had knocked over, 
Ignores the meat and pastries,
Takes off 2 cans of tuna catfood
And a small jar of Hellmans mayo (mt)(sic).
She offers to pay with two 2 dollar
Food stamps but the clerk calls
Local and state police, FBI, treasury 
Department and the USDA.

I won't even ask you 
Which woman was white.
