Letter From The Editor:

Well I am back from HOPE and I have to tell you it kicked ass! The only real
problem was with registration and the photo id's, but other then that, 
everything ran smoothly. I am planning on a smaller h/p event here in PA soon.
We are setting up local meetings and if they have a large turnout then we can
only grow from there.

We will be featuring in this issue some of the events at HOPE and an over all
look at 2600.

This issues UNDERGROUND NEWS column is going to be extremely large since I 
have accumulated a mass amount of interesting news to publish.

In issue #3 of THE ABUSER there is an article on Telenet(Sprintnet). Well the
paragraph on the local dial-up is on TymNet. I had two articles, one on TymNet
and the other on Telenet and the got mixed together. An UPDATE for that 
article will be released soon.

2600 & HOPE:

I know some other magazines have been doing articles on HOPE but I thought I
would still give you guys some information on HOPE and on 2600. Some other
mags to check out are Phrack 46, 2600 Fall, and Wired 2.11. They all have 
articles on HOPE in them. 

2600:
2600 is a "paper" magazine published on a quaterly basis. It is a fairly 
informative magazine. It does have it's ups and downs however. Most ot the
magazine centers around send-in articles from different parts of the country.
Some of the articles are deffinately worthless due to the fact that your state
may not have the same fone company or set up. For some reason (actually it is
probably due to the fact that 2600 is located in New York, the home of NYNEX)
2600 always has articles on NYNEX. Do not get me wrong however. A lot of 
information in 2600 is highly informative, interesting, and useful. The 
biggest problem I have with 2600 is that it is a hacker/phreaker mag and you
have to pay for it. Isn't it our idea that information should be free for 
every to see? Plus it's $4.00(US) for a 45 pages magazine which is ridiculous
for any type of magazine. Last I heard Eric Corley a.k.a. Emmanuel Goldstein
was in trouble for an incident at a 2600 meeting. I think 2600 is a great step
for hacking and phreaking and we need more magazines like it.

HOPE:
Well HOPE was an interesting event. It was kewl to see how other hackers 
looked and acted. The event wasn't organized all that well but I think that
set the atmosphere to be that of more informal and friendly. The biggest pain
in the ass was the registration. Luckily for me I had preregistered and it 
wasn't that bad. It still took a good 30 minutes before I actually got in the
door of the conference. One of the kewlest things was the opening speech by
an ex CIA agent named Robert Steele. I didn't see many of the other seminars
because they were all off schedule and I found it more fun to hang out with
other hackers on the internet connections there and try to get into various
things including the hope.net site. All in all the conference was very 
interesting and if I had the chance I would deffinately go again.

Ex-Central Intelligence Agency employee Robert SteeleA welcomes hackers to
New York.

THE N.Y.C. METROCARD                                     Saturday, 1:00 pm
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
New York City has just introduced a brand new farecard system for mass 
transportation, one unlike any other in the United States. We have been 
gathering data on this system for some time now and hackers all over the world
are trying to figure out ways of cracking it. Unlike most other mass transit
card systems, this one uses master databases. We will read the cards, 
duplicate them, and make every attempt to defeat the system. By the end of 
HOPE, we will have either cracked it or deemed it secure. Your participation
is encouraged. We expect to have representatives of the Metropolitan 
Transportation Authority on hand to answer questions and keep a nervous eye on
us. (update at HOPE conclusion, Sunday 10:30 pm)

LINUX                                                    Saturday, 2:00 pm
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Linux is the Freely Distributable Unix clone available by ftp from many sites
on the Internet. It is a remarkably complete and stable OS for Intel-based 
PC's that is a direct result of the existence of the Internet, which allowed
for the cooperative development team of volunteers to communicate in real-time
during their development of their respective parts of the project. Linux
continues to enjoy rapid development and is a viable and popular alternative
to commercial Unix OS's. It's being installed in basements and at commercial,
academic, and governmental organizations around the world. Michael Johnston,
developer of the new Slackware Professional Linux package (in partnership with
Patrick Volkerding, author of the Slackware distributions of Linux on the 
net), will speak on the differences between the different Linux distributions
available "for free" by ftp on the Internet, and in particular the changes in
Slackware (the most popular Linux distribution on the net) between versions
1.2 and new 2.0.

TDD FUNDAMENTALS                                         Saturday, 3:30 pm

the use of TDD Relay Services. Hosted by Bernie S.

FUN WITH PAGERS                                          Saturday, 4:00 pm
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Have you ever had the opportunity to monitor the pager of your choice, seeing
each and every page as it comes over, alphanumeric included? You will. The 
entire city of New York is wide open and we'll demonstrate exactly how it's 
done. More pager tricks and little-known facts will be presented. Hosted by
Thomas Icom.

HACKER MAGAZINES                                         Saturday, 7:00 pm
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

THE HISTORY OF TAP MAGAZINE
From the early seventies to 1983, the major source for technically 
"subversive" material was TAP Magazine, a publication still eagerly traded by
hackers and phone phreaks today. Originally started by the Yippies and Abbie
Hoffman, TAP evolved into a cornerstone for phreaks all over the world. The 
last editor of TAP, Cheshire Catalyst, will tell the story and answer your 
questions. This is where it all began.

THE FUTURE OF 2600 MAGAZINE
How it all start? How did it almost never happen at all? Are our phones 
tapped? What's the craziest letter we ever got? Who are the people behind the
names? How many lawsuits have we been threatened with? What do the covers 
mean? Where is it all leading? Get the picture?

LEGAL ISSUES                                             Saturday, 9:00 pm
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Dave Banisar of the newly formed Washington DC based Electronic Privacy
Information Center (EPIC) will fill us in on the latest laws, restrictions,
and risks facing us all. There will also be updates on the 2600 Pentagon City
Mall incident and tips on how to make the Freedom Of Information Act work for
you. Come to this panel with any questions or comments about the ACLU, EFF,
CPSR, etc.

WHAT IS THIS CRYPTOGRAPHY STUFF AND WHY SHOULD I CARE?   Saturday, 10:00 pm
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
There have been quite a few articles in the national media recently about
cryptography and privacy. Bob Stratton will attempt to provide an introduction
to the terms and technology, how it affects the average citizen, and insights
into the public policy debate currently raging in Washington and around the
world. There will be a special emphasis on the relationship of cryptographic
technology and emerging personal communications tools. Also, a demonstration
by Bernie S. and John Turbo of the AT&T 3600 Surety device, the world's first
Clipper Chip telephone encryption unit. Attendees will be invited to make
telephone calls between two AT&T 3600's and a loudspeaker will enable all
present to actually hear the encrypted audio. An actual Clipper Chip will be
given away as a door prize with the opportunity to smash it with a hammer in
front of all.

SOCIAL ENGINEERING                                       Saturday, 11:00 pm
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
By far one of the most effective ways of getting information is the art of
social engineering. You will see some live social engineering, get tips on 
what not to do, hear some great legendary tales from the masters, and listen
to social engineering tapes of the past. You are welcome to participate in our
social engineering contest - we give you an operator and you go as far as you 
can. Hosted by SN, Chesire Catalyst, and Emmanuel Goldstein.

LOCKPICKING                                              Sunday, 12 noon

Everything from picks to electric drills to Simplex locks. Hosted by Paul
Bergsman.

THE NATIONAL IDENTIFICATION CARD                         Sunday, 1:00 pm
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
That's right, it may be coming a whole lot sooner than you EVER thought 
possible. As you read this, there is a proposal in the works that would 
establish several states as a testing ground for mandatory national ID card.
We'll have the latest scoop on who's behind this and reaction from civil
liberties and other groups. We'll also be hearing from people in countries
where national ID cards are already a reality and what it means to them. Can
is be stopped? Should it be stopped? Why you need to care.

FOREIGN HACKING                                          Sunday, 2:00 pm
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

THE CHAOS COMPUTER CLUB
For many years now, Germany's Chaos Computer Club has been making headlines 
all over the world for all kinds of mischief. But, as with all things, there
is much much more to the story. For the first time ever, the CCC will be in 
this country to answer questions and share information of all sorts.

HACK-TIC
Although it's almost entirely in Dutch, Hack-Tic and the many people involved
in its production have been the inspiration for hackers all over the planet. 
If HOPE is half as successful as the two hacker congresses Hack-Tic has hosted
(Galactic Hacker Party of 1989 and Hacking at the End of the Universe of 1993)
it will be incredible event. Becuase of the far more relaxed atmosphere in
Holland, hackers there are able to accomplish much more without all of the 
paranoia that is so abundant here. We will hear their story and find out about
all of the technological projects they're involved in.

AUTHORS                                                  Sunday, 3:00 pm
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Steven Levy (Hackers), Winn Schwartau (Terminal Compromise), Paul Tough 
(Harpers, Esquire), Julian Dibbel (Village Voice, Spin), and people involved
in the filming of a major motion picture all about hackers.

CELLULAR                                                 Sunday, 4:00 pm
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
OK, how is it done, really? We've all heard about cellular phone cloning but
how many of us have had the guts to actually do it ourselves? Actually,
probably quite a few because it's relatively easy. But, as with any 
technological trick, there is a multitude of misinformation being handed out.
That won't happen here as the true experts will be on hand to demostrate
cloning and answer questions. We will show how cloning is not made available
for free! You will also see first hand the risks of using a cellular phone.
Hosted by Bernie S. and Count Zero.

OPEN MICROPHONE                                          Sunday, 6:00 pm
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

BOXING                                                   Sunday, 7:00 pm
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Contrary to popular belief, boxing is not dead. As you will see, there are so
many possibilities. We will have some top phone phreaks on hand to show you
what worls, what doesn't, what used to worl, what never did, and what probably
might. American boxing is only one small part of the entire global picture. In
this panel, we guarantee all questions will have answers. Also included: An
overview of current inband systems like R1, R2, and C5. The pains of ANI and
the ease with which it can be spoofed. Cellular and cordless tricks. Hosted by
Billsf and Kevin Crow.

FULL DISCLOSURE - LIVE SHORTWAVE BROADCAST FROM HOPE     Sunday, 8:00 pm
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Learn all about Full Disclosure, a magazine many consider to be as dangerous
as 2600! Free copies will be available. On Sunday at 8 pm a live call-in from
HOPE to "Full Disclosure Live" will take place on international shortwave on
WWCR at 5810 KHz shortwave.

LEECHES, LAMERS, AND LOSERS                              Sunday, 10:00 pm
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
With so many new people being drawn to the net every day, the criminal element
is bound more visible. This means users who destroy files, wipe entire 
systems, harrass users, and cause intentional pandemonium. Perhaps the worst 
part of this is that the media considers such deliberate malice to be another
part of hacking. How do hacker deal with such users and the misperceptions of
the hacker world that are created? Is it proper for hackers to go to the 
authorities on such occasions or will that ultimately backfire? You'll hear
stories, experiences, suggestions, arguments, etc. from experts and 
non-experts alike.

HOPE CONCLUSION                                          Sunday 10:30 pm
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Door prizes will be awarded, we'll hear from Phiber Optik in prison, comments,
questions, and answers from the audience, and a message from the President.

and demonstrating a computer of his own design that will be connected love to
the Internet via wireless technology. Doug will be reporting love on the HOPE
conference via the Internet as he walks around.

"YOU WILL" CONTEST
Getting tired of all those AT&T commercials taking credit for products they 
haven't even invented yet? You will. And now you can have fun while you vent 
your frustration by taking part in our "You Will" contest. We will award 
prizes to the top three finalists on Sunday night.

ITALIAN HACKER CRACKDOWN UPDATE
Earlier this year, one of the most thorough and ominous hacker raids in 
history took place. We'll have updates and eyewitness reports.

PHIBER OPTIK POSTCARDS
Phiber Optik, a hacker currently incarcerated in Pennsylvania, will have a 
statement at the conclusion of the confernce. You can help cheer him up by 
writing a postcard that we'll deliver to him.

DON'T MESS WITH SEGA!

Video pirates beware! Sega of America is lookin' for you! Sega won a legal 
victory that may serve to make vidoe pirates think twice about unauthorized
duplication and sales of video games.

The U.S. Distrct Court for the Northern Distrct of California passed a 
temporary judgement to stop the operator of video bulletin boards for 
violations of state and fedaral law. The court found "substantial evidence 
that the operators were selling $350 video games copiers that made it possible
for users to create and play counterfeit versions of Sega games." These game
copier users were also encouraged to transfer games by computer modems via the
MAPHIA bulletin board. The court concluded that the operation of the bulletin 
board and promotion of counterfeit games threatened to damage Sega's 
reputation and deprive it of revenue.

Although this judgement only stops the operation of the MAPHIA bulletin board
temporarily, Sega will pursue legal actions to permanently shut the system 
down and seek damages that could award Sega up to $50,000 for each title that
was pirated. "With software piracy estimated to be at least a $6 billion 
a-year worldwide problem, this underscores Sega's determination to protect our
rights. We will not allow pirates to sap up the vitality of the interactive
digital entertainment industry." said Sega Vice President/Marketing Bill 
White.

FEDERAL ALERTNESS FOR ALL SYSOPS:

        Yeah, I'm sure all ya sysops heard about the large amt. of Fed's
Scoping out H/P/V/A/C boards.  Well it just so happens I know a fed who will
remain nameless for his security.  After all he is a good fed who tells me
how to get away with lotsa shit.  Anyway he told me of a couple of ways to
spot feds on local boards.

        1). Look out for users with names like Hacker, Phreak-man, Warez-kid
            and other blantly pathetic attempts to fit in.
        2). Look out for thos symbols popping up like a hard-on in a porn
            theatre. stuff like this
                
                 Hey man, WUWY(what's up With you). Dfsgdsdg, sorry KRAMK 
                 (Kat ran across my keyboard) and other uses of acronyms
                 In all there messages.
        3). New comers asking alot of questions! "How do you do this?"
            This is a way feds can nab you on the spot.
        4). Look out for people, that say they are kids, with like mega-
            machines. Yeah im'15 and I got a pentium with 16 megs and
            1.3 gis.
Most of all feds Just try to look real cool.  Beware of poeple that seem to
be "too good to be true".  And never ever go out with a stranger. 
   
      That's it for me. Hope all this might stop you from being put in jail!

HPAVC Hot Spots:

Seems there has been some confusion as to some of the boards listed in the
HPAVC Hot Spots column. Not ALL of the boards listed in this column are CAFBL
distro's unless they are noted as such.
