Chapter I. Intro       
          
  The purpose of this manuscript is to introduce useful Field techniques. 
These techniques have been developed by myself, Anonymous Caller, and many 
others.




Chapter II. Field Kit

  This Field Kit is neccessity for the real Phreaker. Some so-called Phreaks
get all of their information including codes from Bbs's and have a big enough 
ego to claim to be real Phreaks. Real Phreaks acquire knowledge on his own
through Exploring and Experimenting.
Following is a list of items you need in your Kit:


-  Test Phone...:Most important tool. I'll tell you how to get one and make one.
-  BackPack.....:Get a big one to hold all your shit.
-  Ratchets.....:You need only 7/16" and 3/8" size.
-  Screwdrivers.:Medium,Large, and a Phillips head screwdrivers.
-  Wire Cutters.:In case you want to fuck up someones phone lines.
-  Pliers.......:Miscellaneous.
-  Xacto Knife..:To strip wires.
-  Flashlight...:If you need alot of light.
-  Penlight.....:Smaller the better, I hold mine in my mouth when I work.
-  Paper & Pen..:Write down numbers,people you want to call,codes,locations,etc.
-  Golves.......:Make shure you don't get lit up.
-  Walkie Talkie:In case your with somebody else who is the lookout.
-  Pocket dialer:This should have a Red Box built in it, Just in Case..
-  Marlboro Reds:To calm your nerves and pass the time on the alliance.
-  Bandana......:Manholes <Bell ones anyway> are real fuckin dusty.
-  Dark Clothes.:Have to be dark to conceal yourself from The Gestapo.
-  Lighter......:For the cigarrettes and smoke diversions
-  Smoke Bombs..:Blind The Gestapo
-  Bolt Cutters.:Heavy and sometimes not needed, But are very useful.


  Keep everything where you can find it. You don't wan't to be searching for
your Cigarrettes when your having a nic fit.


Chapter III. Making a Test Phone

  The test phone is the most Important piece of equipment for Field Work. You
can try to sneak into a Bell Truckyard and get a real Test Set. If you'd rather
not do this, don't worry making your own is simple.
  
  First get a telephone set for your own purposes. Find the wire coming out of
the phone that is supposed to go to the wall jack. It should be at least three
feet long for convience. Cut off the Modular jack at the end of the wire. Strip
the wire, and there should be at least two wires most of the phones around me
have four, Red,Green,Black,Yellow. You want the red, and the green. If you 
open up your phone and there is no red, or green don't worry its usually the
two middle wires. Take these wires and strip them, solder the wires to two 
different aligator <these should be insulated> clips. You now have a Test Phone
Now lets see if you hooked everything up right. Where I live the Phone boxes
are in the basements, or they could be on the outside of your house. Wherever
they are, it should look like a Grey little box that says some goofy shit like
Telephone Network InterFace and have Ma bells little phukin bell on it. The
Cover on this should pop right up. Now inside there will be some screws these
are the terminals. Now the phrase to remeber is Ring Right Red. You hook up
the red wires to the rightmost terminal. Then the green to the left one. If
you get a dialtone Good job, your phone is now in violation of one of those
fucking laws concerning wiretapping. If not hey, don't sweat it keep fucking
with it. Now that your phone is working "Go To Work." You now can hook your 
phone up to any terminals and call out and/or listen in. Be carful, though
you dont want to be on 1-900-HOT-SEXX when the person who lives there picks up
the phone. If you want to you could hook up a line and run them to your room
and call LD and D/L all night. But, make sure you take the line down before 
Dawn. Because most people would want to now why theres a line running from
there house to your bedroom.


Chapter IV. ManHoles

  One way to get access to alot of fuckin phone lines is to get into a manhole.
Now you don't want get into a Sewer manhole so look around at the lids of the
manholes there should be a goofy little bell on it. if you cant find one with a
bell on it take a trip to the Central Office and see what the lids look like 
down there.
  Now getting into one of these fuckers is a different story. Where I live it 
takes about 3 people to open these things up. Two people to pry with crowbars
and one person to push the lid off. Once you get the lid off look down the hole
with a flashlight. If you see a ladder head down. If not look for another one.
Most of the time there will be a few inches of water at the bottom so wear 
boots. Once you get down there it will be dusty <I speak from Experince> so 
make sure you have you bandana with you. Down there you might get some manuals
take the fuckers look through them maybe you'll learn something. Running along
the wall there will be some PVC tubes, the wires are in the tubes. Attached to
these tubes there will be some short, wide plastic cylinders. You will either
need a ratchet or a screwdriver to get the thing open. If you get the fucker
open, Good job you now have access to countless phone lines. I'm shure you know
what to do now.

Chapter V. Exploring Bell Truckyards

  One of the best ways to learn about Ma and all her ways, is to visit a
truckyard or the central office and take whatever you can get your hands on.
Ma Bell doesn't give a fuck about there shit, which is why they leave their
trucks unlocked. Also you can have Phun checking the Dumpsters for documents
and shit like that. Who knows you may get lucky. But the most fun is going
through the truckyards and getting shit. The first time I checked a truckyard
I came out with 3 Test sets, A hard hat :), A tool belt, and 50 feet of cable.
I'll describe how I did it. First off wait till real late like 2-3:00 then go
to the back of the yard someplace where it is dark and you have at least 2 
exits <don't let yourself get corned, always have a plan> once there they
usually park the trucks with the rear doors toward the fence. Simply cut the 
fence and open the doors, crawl inside and take whatver the fuck you want.


Chapter VI. Bell Boxes

  In this chapter I will focus mainly on Bell terminal boxes.

Home Boxes - This will vary from city to city. Where I live the boxes are
located in the basements of the houses. Therefore you can't really get to them
unless you want to break into the house and go into the basement, so I wont go
into depth with this one.

Mulit-Line boxes - Around me these are usually found behind apartments or 
sometimes for no aparent reason on poles placed close to the bottom. Usually 
they are Aluminum with the bell on it. When you find one of these in a nice spot
you can phreak you ass off. Theres usually about 20 terminals just waiting to be
phreaked. This is where (if not to far) you can run a line up to your room and 
D/l all night. 

Small Distribution Boxes - Usually these boxes are a light green in color and
in front of buisness'. There are two different sizes of of wires in the box.
The large wies lead to buildings while the small ones lead to other boxes to
be spliced into large ones.

Medium Distribution Boxes - The same as the small ones, except that there is a 
flat access panel that has to be taken off.

Flat Peg Boxes - These are mostly found behind Supermarkets or large office
complexs' and shopping malls. Most of the time they are mounted on the wall and
are opened by a handle on a hinged door. Inside the the terminals will be 
grouped in bunches of four. The terminals are long flat pegs. Its hard to hook 
up the clips because the terminals are so close together. It gets easier with 
practice.

Wire Box - A very nice box and the one I always look for. Light green in color
and about 3 feet off the ground and has two doors open by a single latch, which
is usually locked by a Padlock and one of those locks you see on a soda machine
How you get it open is a different story. Just do it when theres no people
around. Inside the wires lead into long, palstic grouping stations. There will
be a tool attached by two screws on the side of the door. Connect your phone to
the screws then use the tool and connect it to one of the grouping stations,
You should here a dial tone. There are several different lines in one grouping
station.

Terminal Boxes - This has to be the king of all boxes. One box may contain up
to 800 lines! I doubt you will have trouble finding these boxes, they are 4 
feet in height and are that light green color with the bell logo on it. After
opening a box, you will see many red and white numbered terminal pairs on each
side. On the inside each door there are two srews leading out to double current
aligators. Connect your phone to the screws and then the alligators to anyone of
the terminals.  


Chapter VII. Outro

  Hopefully you now have enough knoweledge to start you on the wonderful road
of Phield Phreaking. Here are a few tips. 

1. Always have a plan. In case somebody asks you what your doing have a story
   ready.

2. Don't corner yourself, always have to escape routes.

3. Its good to have a Skateboard or something should somebody chase ya.

4. If ya get caught, stay cool. If your a minor don't worry about jail you'll
   only get a real stiff fine, thats about it. If your over 18, I'm pretty
   shure your fucked in ass. SO better whatch it out there!!
