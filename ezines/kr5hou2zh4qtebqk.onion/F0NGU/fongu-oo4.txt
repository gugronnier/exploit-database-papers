,-( hi & bye )-----------------------------------------------------(ewheat)-,

	Hey wee lads.  It's your buddy ewheat again.  It's been awhile since
 the last fongu was created.  We've had tragic events that caused the delay
 of this issue of fongu.  We will not discuss those, for fongu isn't written
 by angst-driven-coffee-sipping-"I hate-everyone" misfits.  We will focus on
 the brighter side... fongu is back!!!!!

	* one person cheering *

	Thank you.  There isn't much to say... except that most of the old
 fongu staff have either grown up (cidica), been repressed by THE MAN (fah),
 registered themselves with Chronic Masturbator Clinics (mrO), sold out to
 Corporate America (me!@)

        No, I'm not gone... and neither of them are.  They will be back.
 They have a mission.  A mission that requires a lifetime commitment for the
 betterment of life in these states of the United States of America.

        Hah.  Yeah right.

	"... if you make it... they will come..."

	Shut up, I'm writing my editorial here.  On the postitive side,
 fongu's old mate... spo0k decided to stay with us for this marvelous issue
 and broke his own record (a total of 3 articles!!!!!) Thank you spo0k.

	<spo0k> You're welcome, ewheat!  Hey, anyone wanna play Diablo?

	And we have a newcomer to fongu!  He isn't new to writing though...
 this person has published many issues of his own zany 'zine "Illbient" which
 I loved and made it my mission to recruit him under the fongu label at no
 costs.  He has spurted many articles out of those rambling fingers of his...
 fongu 4 wouldn't have been here for this person. I present you, a new friend
 and a new slave.. erhm... writer.  The Prodigy!  Thank you Mr. Prodigy!

	<proDJ> You're welcome, ewheat!  My spider-sense is tingling, that
                means I have to void my bowels!

	And you've got me!!  Mr. ewheat the head honcho!  Uhm... thank you me
 for ruining  everyone's lives and the right to peace of mind. Thank you, me.

	<ewheat> You're welcome, me!  uhh... HI ME!

	And also, we have a very intelligent character associating with
 fongu!!!  (now we're not a "dumb 'zine" anymore!!)  We present you... Dr.
 Clemtus Alfphasika, Professor of Proctology at Ohio State University Medical
 Department.

,-( letters to the editor )---------------------------------(Stupid People)-,

        Dear Mr. Wheat,

 can i call you e? oh well.. i'd better stick to mr. wheat.  anyways, i'm
 writing this in response to an article in your last publication entitled
 "mad cows disease" by spo0k.  this article discussed the cow fucking
 community and the risk against mad cows disease.  i for one am glad this
 article was published, it made me feel much better about coming out of the
 closet.  i too have fucked cows for close to three years now and never
 really understood why.  i began to think i was sick in some sort of way, and
 i didn't think anyone else shared these lusts towards bovine as i do.  well
 this article reinforced my feelings that what i was doing was normal, and
 helped to alleviate a lot of stress i was having as a result of masturbating
 on bessie.  i just didn't want my daughters to grow up thinking their daddy
 was some kind of freak for fucking my cow.  i just wanted to express my
 admiration to your "e-zine" as they are called for your courage to publish a
 subject of such objectionable manner, and i hope it has helped others as it
 has helped me. keep up the good work!!

                                        Sincerly,
                                            Michael A. Burnes
                                            Boise, Idaho


        Well, Thank you Mr. Burnes.  Fongu is always happy to assist people
 with domestic difficulties.  It is normal for members of the human race to
 breed with farmyard animals!  If you are concerned about your reputation or
 social status... I'd suggest moving to West Virginia or some European
 country.  People like people like you there!@

        Dear Fongu,


        I masturbated too hard and my pepper broke off. :( :( :( :( :( :( :(
 help! :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :(

        Oh, silly newbie.  That has happened to us multiple times.  You
 haven't a thing to worry about.  spo0k prefers to use Elmer's glue to fix
 that problem.  Prodigy uses rubber cement (God knows why).  Personally, I
 use 3m Super Sticky Glue.  Works like a snap... uhm, that wasn't a pun.

                                                -ewheat

        I've read fongu issues 1-3, but I cannot understand the concept of
 poking at sex for the subject of humor.  Tell me, how in the white man's
 Hell do you find hermaphodites, homosexuals, masturbating and degrading
 other races humorous?  I pity the African American brothers and sisters who
 dangle amongst your side, for they do not know they are associating with an
 enemy of the African American race.  Hath you no Islamic value?  Allah damns
 you.

                                        Blackingly yours,
                                            Reverend Louis Farrakhan

 P.S. Make fun of those Kike Jews, will you?


        Poop.  Allah damns me.  I'll never be a member of the Brotherhood
 now. :(  First of all.  Sex/masturbation/homosexuality/etc have always been
 a forbidden subject and probably wont always be... so it is our moment to
 seize the moment and poke fun at it while it's still hot and cooking.  As
 for other races.  Fongu is a multicultural 'zine... we degrade each
 existing race/sex/breed offered on this planet earth (including ourselves)

                                                -ewheat

 P.S. MAYBE!!!  They are a race, aren't they?

,-( success in the office )-----------------------------------------(spo0k)-,

        ok boys and girls.. erhm wait girls don't read this, at least, not
 attractive girls, they don't have irc.. wait.. do girls have irc?

         oh well.. who gives a fuck.. a lot has happened to yer old pal spo0k
 since fongu3, one thing is, he works for a law firm setting up and managing
 their network, as well as providing tech support for the brainless
 secretaries who are too stupid to operate a stapler correctly not to mention
 the $2000 computers they all have, and besides that, they aren't even hot, i
 mean, i don't even masturbate about them.. (well ok, i don't masturbate
 about them anymore, but what's the difference).. so basically i go in and
 try to make things the way my bosses want them while still trying to get the
 secretaries to like me (apparently that has some bearing on my employment
 there..) but i never usually get things done.. the worst part is i don't
 really ever get time off, because i'm seemingly allways on call, they call
 me in the morning, in the evening, on the weekend, anytime i'm not at work i
 allways have to leave my fone off the hook for fear they might talk to me..
 one of them called me in the morning and said "i came in this morning and my
 computer was in the middle of the floor and it doesn't work, what the hell
 did you do to it?!" well of course she woke me up (i was planning on a day
 off) and i guess i didn't talk in the most pleasant tone (i guess i offended
 her) so she was all pissy the rest of the day.. incidentally.. the computer
 was 6" from where it normally sits and the only problem was the mouse was
 plugged into the keyboard slot and vice-versa..

 anyway, to the point of the article, pleasing your dog in bed..

 if yer reading this at work i would stop and wait till you get home cuz i
 dont' know about yer boss but my boss doesn't like me masturbating on the
 clock (at least, not on his desk.. but that's another story)

 anyways, back to the point, masturbation in the office..

 the best place to go is yer office, you can allways lock the door and face
 your computer so if yer boss manages to get in you can look like yer working
 (don't forget to turn your computer on first and load up a document, i made
 the mistake of getting caught masturbating in front of a blank screen and he
 just didn't believe me <shrug> i still can't figure out why) but if yer an
 un-appreciated employee (like me.) and you don't have an office.. its always
 fun to go sit under a secretaries desk and start hammin it when she comes
 back to sit down (it's allways better to find a secretary who's wearing a
 skirt that day, so you can see her panties).. you can jizz all over her legs
 and then run, just make sure yer boss isn't around.. but the all time best
 place is laying down on yer bosses desk and masturbating, it gives you such
 a feeling of power to leave yer baby making juice all over his important
 documents, especially documents that he has to pass along to female
 coworkers (cuz if you get lucky they charge him with sexual harrasment and
 he gets fired cuz you couldn't keep it in yer pants at work that day)..
 but again, make sure yer boss isn't around cuz if he see's you, he might
 join in, and it takes the fun out of it.. on the otherhand, if yer boss is a
 female, she'll either start fragging herself right there, or, in the more
 likely scenario, she'll fire you and sue you with sexual harrassment, the
 difference between masturbating with her around and doing it all over the
 sexetaries is that the secretaries are too stupid to know the definition of
 sexual harrassment, in fact, they'll probably leave a voice mail for you
 saying "i don't think my computer is working right, it just spit all over
 me, can you come take a look at it?" in which case, you can come down the
 hall and look under her desk and say "hmm.. i think i'll stake out down here
 for a bit and see if it does it again" and you can proceed to ham it some
 more, thus creating an endless cycle untill she forgets how to use her phone
 or you get overly sore and tell her she's retarded for not knowing that you
 just masturbated on her about 40 times in the last half-hour, in which case
 she will look at you like she doesn't understand and leave you a voice mail
 20 minutes later that say's "just wondering if you were ever gunna fix my
 computer, i'll be here for the rest of the afternoon" i hope you get a lot
 of masturbation pleasures out from reading this article, more to come from
 yer pal spo0k

 oh.. on a side note, my mad cows disease cleared up, and bessie is doing
 fine..

,-( History of masturbation )-------------------------------------(prodigy)-,

 <ewheat> You must write for fongu4.
 <ewheat> yes you must!
 <DJprodigy> whoa... really? like, about what?
 <ewheat> hmmm... something sexual.  masturbation.  uhm... anything. :)

 and now, by special spankin' request, an article for fongu@004.
                                                     by the gods! er, prodigy

         Many people have misconceptions about masturbation. Masturbation was
 a self defence technique developped by a US Advisory council in the late 
 1930's.  It was named after its creator, one(1) John Masturbation. He had 
 devised a way to defend one's self in case one is attacked and seriously 
 outnumbered. How it was accomplished:

        1) drop thy pants
        2) flail around

           As different as it was from today's version of masturbation, from 
 it sprung(excuse the pun) the seeds of contemporay exual relief for those 
 without a significant other.  Its most practical application at the time was
 to combat the nazi menace in WW2. Field attempts using the original method 
 were slightly less than successful, and alterations to the technique
 (anything from adding a texas two step, one of the more popular dance
 manouvers of the era, to pulling a quarter from an enemy's ear which was
 later revealed as a trick, causing the nazis to become even more infuriated)
 were duds.

          However, a young soldier who ineptly performed the technique during
 a combat situation performed the activity we now associate with masturbation
 in battle. Axis casualties were staggering. The nazis tried to combat it,
 but it was all for naught. Sperm warfare was too powerful a force. By the
 time it was over,  there were over 200, 000 masturbatory-related kills.
 Regretfully, said young soldier was posthumously presented with the
 millitary's highest honor at that time, The Good Military Guy Award. (He was
 killed after being ambushed in his bunker. He had gone deaf, ans also
 suffered from epilepsy. While it hasn't been conclusively proven that
 masturbation was the cause of this, rumors still abound to this day.

            Sperm warfare was banned in 1962. Masturbation techniques are
 still talked about in sexual education classes to this day, so that the
 young people of this country can defend themselves in times of war.

         Addendum: references to the evils of masturbation were tacked into
 the bible in the past 20 years to make it a more interesting read. Now many
 modern scholars believe the bible is in reality, soft-core pornography.

        But that's for another issue. G'night.

.-( fongu crack )--------------------------------------------------(ewheat)-,

        Drugs are cool.  It's trendy.  The blue-haired kid next to you does
 drugs.  Cubans do drugs.  Marcia Brady does drugs.  It is VERY COOL to do
 drugs!!!!!!  Unfortunately, fongu is employed of poor writers with no money.
 Therefore, we cant enjoy the leisure time drugs provide.  Because of our
 cash shortage, we've managed to improvise.  After endless hours of carefully
 observing the ways of The Frugal Gourmet and Betty Crocker... we've managed
 to produce our own chemical stimulant!

 Items needed : 
 --------------
  A stove
  
  6 oz. bag of Gummi Bears(c) (not Gummi Worms or any stupid replacement)
  16+ Pixy Stixs (the more, the better)
  Cheap metal container (used for melting the gummi bears)
  Crisco(tm)!  (hmm, yummy crisco(tm)!!)
  Mixing spoon (plastc sporks are cool!)
  Some munchies (preferably doritios or ding dongs)

 Instructions :
 --------------

    Step 1:

        Spread the Crisco(tm) across the metal container (so your stuff wont
 stick!@) uhm... that's step one.

 Step deux: 

        Dump the bag of Gummi Bears(c) in the metal container.  Yeah.  Cool.

  Step III:

        Set an oven on "High," and place the metal container on the open
 stove.  Prepare for it to melt.

    Step 5:

        Wait.

  Step 5.1:
        
        Uhm, wait.

  Step 5.7:

        Drink Dr. Pepper and eat some Ding Dongs. <--- fongu plug.

   Step 666:

        Assuming the gummi bears have melted by now.  Hold all pixy stix'
 with one hand.  Using scissors or a sharp object, snip all the edges off
 (from one end, not both of them.  doof.)  Dump them in the container and
 use the spork... or spoon to mix the pixy stix + gummi bears into a nice
 puree.  The mixture should be a transparent Green + white color pattern.


 Step 7 (Brad Pitt Promo!):

        Place the metal container in a fridge... or if you're in Alaska or
 some eskimo country... place it outside.  Allow it to freeze over some
 time.

   Step ate:

        Assuming you used Crisco/Vaseline/lubricant/jizz, the mixture should

,-( Fuck women )----------------------------------------------------(spo0k)-,

bah

fuck women

who needs 'em... especially not us internet junkies, we can just get porn
anytime we want.. i mean come on.. who needs women when you have porn..

how many women do you know that you can just walk up to at any time of
the day (or really late at night, depending on if you live at home wif
yer mommy) that you can just walk up to, whip it out, and start hammin away?
well you can with porn..

and to go along with that... i know you none of you have big dicks (hey,
lets face it.. if you were a stallion you wouldn't be depending on the
internet for social interaction) and i dunno about you, but my porn doesn't
laugh at my 2".. in fact, she's usually smiling.. or moaning.. if there is
much of a difference..

now i know what yer thinking (or maybe you've never had a girlfriend in
which case you really DO need the internet) "porn can't hold you.. you cant
hug porn and tell it yer problems, you can't kiss porn.." PHOOEY... i have
held, talked to, caressed, kissed, jizzed on, and done everything you can
think of to my porn.. and hey, that porn with the captions, who the hell do
you think she's talking to? YOU!

so there.. porn is the perfect replacement for women.. another bonus is, porn
is allways naked, or involved in some sort of erotic action, man.. how many
girls do you know that every time you see them they are either masturbating,
fucking, getting fucked, giving head, getting head, smacking dogs on the
head, cumming, going, or just naked in general (hey if you do know anyone
like this, find me on irc (as long as i'm not idle masturbating) and tell me
and i'll move right over to yer town and get me some of that shit!!)

,-( Unresolved Childhood Issues )---------------------------------(prodigy)-,

        FONGU: AMERICA'S GOOD TIME ZINE. BY THE PRODODIGY.

 I think playgrounds are evil, evil things. and i feel this way for 2
 reasons, they're too dangerous, and they're not dangerous enough.

 "huh? you crazy prodigy, whatchootalkinbout, willis?"

 shut the fuck up, junkie. here we go...

        when you were a kid, you liked to play on the jungle gym, right?
 well, I wasn't like you. I was scared to fucken death of that thing. when i
 was like a little kid, they(the MAN) wouldn't let me go there. Then, when I
 was finally allowed to go there, the second time I went, I got bullied by
 some big kids, & this continued for like, 2 years. I got my reasons for
 hating them. However, I see in hindsight that they are, in fact, tools of
 SATAN HIMSELF.

         SATAN! You heard right, bitch. Why do you think all those kids
 carved all those nasty words on the park benches?  see?  EVIL!

        Only recently have I noticed how dangerous things were there. First
 of all, you know that pole you can slide down? yeah, the AVERAGE kid (circa
 1985) could go down it just fine, but now that that pole's 12 years old, its
 so damn ass rickety you'd probably get lockjaw just looking at it. And a
 good tug on a kid's leg could rip his arms off if he was climbing on the
 monkey bars.

        Though its never something I MYSELF have contemplated doing.

        On an unrelated note,  have you ever wanted to shove a basketball
 down your shirt and pretend you were the world's first pregnant man?

        Me, neither. Back to the article...

        The odd thing is, you always wanted it as a kid to be more dangerous.
 I mean how many of us found hypodermic needles around like we wanted to?
 ( you know what else just occurred to me... didn't you ever wonder when you
 were six WHY someone would be leaving a bunch of needles around? No!  If you
 did, you'd probably think some old crazy guy <the one who gives out apples
 with the razor blades in them> was leaving them around, or maybe a really
 sloppy doctor.  But I'm digressing). Anyways, if you did, I envy you.

        Now, I think it'd be pretty cool if you like had a crocodile or two
 at the bottom of the slide, or under the monkey bars. I mean, there's
 putting the whole natural selection thing to work right there,  eh?  So, if
 you're little Timmy's parents, you better whip that chunky bastard into
 shape,  cause he may not make it home tonight with all his beloved
 appendages! hAH! The kids who do make it are given daily excersize right
 there.

        Remember kids, this is not a drill.  I stand by any/all my theories,
 so if you got a problem with it, you can take a number in my lineup of
 people who will have a few less teeth to worry...  wait.  I'm not a
 stereotypical italian mob enforcer.

        Damn.

                                                        warmest regards,
                                                                    Prodigy.

,-( Stealing Nintendo 64 )-----------------------------------------(ewheat)-,

 Materials you'll need
        -o- Scissors
        -o- Construction Paper (Brown and Orange)
        -o- Blue T-shirt (XXL)
        -o- Some glue
        -o- Magnum 44 Marker (Black)
        -o- Large Box of cardboard (Refridgrator sized)
        -o- Social Enigneering skills

        Carefully take the scissors, cut the brown construction paper in
 as many circles as you can.  Preferably a range between 3 and 6 inches in
 diameter.  After about fifteen or so circles, you're all done with the hard
 work!@  You're on your way to getting that Nintendo64!@

        Now comes the complicated part.  Glue all the Orange papers all
 across the cardboard box, giving it a nice Orangey coat.  Take the circles
 you made, and dabble them all over the box.  There!@#  You have a big orange
 box with brown circles!@  Keep going!@

        Now slide yourself in the box, adjust the box around so it suits
 you, then cut two tiny holes in the front, so you can see.  Then two holes
 on the sides, so you can stick your arms out of these... and stuff.

        Carefully slide the big orange box with brown circles in the XXL
 blue t-shirt you prepared.  Take the big fat-ass Magnum 44 out and carefully
 write "Geoffrey" across the front of the blue t-shirt.

        Now, you are Geoffrey the giraffee (or that's what people will think)
 you now have control over Toys-R-Us.

        Skeedaddle to your local Toys-R-Us.  Dont forget to put the suit on.
 Failure to use the suit will cause this mission to fail.  There might be
 a few kids who will squeal or grab your butt-tocks once they see you.  Don't
 worry, that's how kids react to Geoffrey.  Work your way towards the 
 management system. You'll usually stumble upon some pimple-faced 17 year old
 peon.  Not to worry, you're the respectable mascot of Toys-R-Us.  (Follow
 the directions CAREFULLY)  

 1.) Inquire if you can have access to the storage room in the electronic
 toys department (that's where the nintendo64 is!@... use your Geoffrey-given
 authority if necessary... or a nice prompt bitchslap will do.)

 2.) After you've obtained the keys.  Locate the storage room

 3.) Locate the big ugly boxes that say "Nintendo 64" (that's nintendo64!@)

 3.) Stuff the Nintendo64 box under your suit. (There wont be any bulge since
 it's a cardboard suit!@)

 4.) Escape Toys-r-us.  Dont forget to keep up with the Geoffrey perky
 attitude.  Be sure to say phrases such as...

        "HI, I AM GEOFFREY THE GIRAFFEE!@  HI KIDS!"

        "HI, WOULD YOU LIKE TO GO TO THE BICYCLE SECTION, INSTEAD?  HELLO!@
        OH WHAT?  I DONT HAVE A NINTENDO64 UNDER MY SUIT, NO I DONT!@  YOU'RE
        SILLY!@  HI!@#  HELLO!@#  *HONKING*"

        "BYE!@"

 Troubleshooting:

 <Pimple faced 17 year old manager> "You're not Geoffrey, you're some kid in
 a cardboard box."

 <you> "Didn't you hear about the cutbacks?  Toys-r-us cant afford a nice
 furry suit for little old me anymore.  I am outraged.  I am a Toys-r-us
 icon, now let me through!"
 --------
 <Pimpled faced 17 year old manager> "Give me the keys after you're done."

 <you> "No."  (this is essential for future Toys-r-us projects.)
 --------
 <Little screaming brat> "HI GEOFFREY, CAN I PUNCH YOU IN THE BUTT?!@"

 *punch*

 <you> "Listen here you little snot nosed piece of shit, touch my ass again
 and I'll tell your mom."
 --------
 <Little screaming bitch> "HI GEOFFREY, WILL YOU MARRY ME?"

 <you> "Since pedophilia is illegal in all 50 states.  Move to Sweden with
 me... then it's a deal."

        Hopefully you wont have to undergo all the problems mentioned above.
 If the whole operation was a success... Congratulations!@  You now own a
 Nintendo 64 (and the keys to the storage room!@)  Fongu is proud of you!@

GEORGE MICHAEL, BACK WITH A VENGANCE. by the prodigy."Hi! I'm Rex!""And I'm Judy. And welcome to another meeting of... THE SCIENCE ALLIANCE!"      The classroom erupts in subtle laughter. Yes, straight out of the mid-1980's Scarborough Board of Education science video archives, we kick outanother too cool for radio episode of the Science Alliance.        The plethora of bad films shown in the grade 10 advanced summerschool course is quite frankly unparalelled. Though nothing had come closeto this.  The film was about.. well, I don't know. But the things said werereally unimportant. It was a totally non-slick, poorly concieved piece ofwork that could only be reached in the "slap any old crap together, we'vegot lots of money!" period of the school systems of North America. As I satripping an infected scab off of my forehead, the program took its amporphousshape.        This is not to say there wasn't learning to be head. "At its hottestpoint, the sun is 50,000(!) times hotter than the hottest kitchen oven."Whoa!  I'd never be able to understand some sort of denomination of degrees!Only through the magic of metaphors could something like that be trulycomprehended.  Thanks, Science Alliance!        Then, at regular intervals, some idiot named Bryant would enlightenus with his uh, insights.        "Did someone say peanuts, Judy?"        "Why yes I did, Bryant!"        "It's time for another of... BRYANT'S GIANTS OF SCIENCE!"        OOooooh. Through his masterful storytelling, he weaved a tale aboutthe late George Washington Carver, who came up with over 300 different usesfor the peanut and peanut related products. However, he had his doubters.        "That's monkey food!" One exclaimed!        "No it isn't!" Was Carver's reply. (wow. colour me impressed.)        Now, peanuts can be used to make things such as soap, paint, and(This caught my attention) explosives.        One thing bothered me about the program more than anything. Theletters supposedly written in by kids were questions like "what is the firstlaw of thermodynamics? - johnny, age 11" or things to that effect. Finally,as the credits rolled, it hit me. The actor who played Bryant wasn'tACTUALLY called Bryant at all! (Rex and Judy were actually Rex and Judy)        Man, did I feel betrayed.---

One man's quest for enlightenment in an oppressive and domineering yet oddlydocile indoeuropean aristocracy circa the mid 1970's. by the prodigy.Science is messy."Dissection will be on thursday."        These words set a ripple through the class like nobody's business. Iwas somewhat surprised. Going into Grade 11 biology, I had yet to do any formof dissection in my tenure at the Scarborough Board of Education ("We killthe homeless. It's our business." My computer science teacher didn'tappreciate that as much as I did, or how I put it as a background in everWindows 95 background in my class, but I'm digressing). Anyway, I wasn'treally afraid of seeing dissection. Hacking them apart just gave me theheebie jeebies.
        YES! HEEBIE JEEBIES! ARGH!        Anyway, Thursday rolled around with an added bonus. We'd bedissecting a fish AND a frog! As the teacher rolled out a cart withziplocked frogs in rubber casings, and a tray of dead perch, we set to work.The fish dissection was much more difficult, as its skin was much thicker.It was kind of surreal.  I in fact did no cutting, it just weirded me outtoo much. It went pretty well except for the fact that when rinsing off thecut open fish a jet of water, uh kinda BLEW UP most of its insides. That wasnot fun.        Now... to the frog. After it being opened up, things just kind ofwent straight to hell. As the teacher teachered(known as some circles asteaching), the two other members of my group methodically thought of ways toobliterate & destroy the frog. As its appendages were being methodicallysliced off, I made the mistake of blurting out:        "What the fuck else can you do to this thing? Take out its brain?"        It was something not unlike Richard Nixon yelling "Fuck!" on those,um Watergate tapes. Yeah. Their eyes lit up as they cracked the head likethey crack chests on 'ER'. They air conditioned that frog, All right. It wasjust creepy.        I went home, filled out my options correction sheet, and violentlycrossed out BIO3AV (my grade 11 gifted biology credit) from the sheet.
