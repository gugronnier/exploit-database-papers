             SunView/SunTools selection_svc Vulnerability 



August 23, 1990, 1600 PST                                   Number A-32



CIAC has been advised that there is a vulnerability (Sun Bug ID

1039576) in systems running SunView under SunOS 4.x (or SunTools under

SunOS 3.x).  The SunView/SunTools selection_svc facility may allow a

remote user unauthorized access to selected files from a computer

running SunView.   The problem exists in Sun3 and Sun4 platforms

running SunOS 3.x, 4.0, 4.0.1, 4.0.3, and 4.1 as well as 386i platforms

running SunOS 4.0, 4.01, and 4.0.2.   Because the selection_svc process

continues to run until terminated, this vulnerability can be exploited

even after a user changes to another window system after running

SunView/SunTools or logs off the system.  (The problem is in

SunView/SunTools, however, and not with other window systems such as

X11.)  CERT/CC provides additional details:



    On Sun3 and Sun4 systems, a remote system can read any file that is

    readable to the user running SunView.  On the 386i, a remote system 

    can read any file on the workstation running SunView regardless of

    protections.  Note that if root runs Sunview, all files are 

    potentially accessible by a remote system.  If the password file with 

    the encrypted passwords is world readable, an intruder can take the 

    password file and attempt to guess passwords.



A patch for this vulnerability is available for Sun 4.x systems.  Call 

your local Sun answer center, phone (800) USA-4SUN, anonymous ftp into 

sun-fixes on uunet.uu.net, or send e-mail to:



    security-features@sun.com
