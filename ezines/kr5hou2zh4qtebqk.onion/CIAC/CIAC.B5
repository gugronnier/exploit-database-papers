            HP-UX Trusted Systems 6.5 or 7.0, Authorization Problem

            -------------------------------------------------------

Summary::  Critical HP-UX Trusted Systems Facts 

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

PROBLEM:        May allow non-privileged users to gain root access.

PLATFORM:       Hewlett Packard, Trusted Systems 6.5/7.0

DAMAGE:         Allows unauthorized system modification.

WORKAROUND:     Ensure correct password files and use user names less than 8 

                characters.

PATCH:          H.P. is aware of this problem and has released patch P025, 

                available from the HP Response Center or your local HP

                representative.

SYSTEM IMPACT:  Inconvenience of temporarily changing some user names.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------



CIAC has learned of a serious security problem with Hewlett Packard

Trusted Systems 6.5/7.0, which may allow non-privileged users to gain

root access.  Two problems exist within the user authentication

(login) system.  Both problems only effect the secure C2 version of

HP-UX.  If you are running Trusted Systems 6.5 or 7.0, then the

vulnerability exists on your system.  The two related vulnerabilities

are:



Problem 1

If you are running Trusted Systems HP-UX you must be absolutely sure

that each entry in your /.secure/etc/passwd file matches an entry in

your /etc/passwd file.  If you have an entry in /.secure/etc/passwd,

and not in /etc/passwd, the user will be authorized and given root

privileges.



Problem 2

A related vulnerability has to do with users that have 8 character

user names.  If any users have user names of 8 characters, you should

change them to 7 or less characters until you install the patch

described below.



Solution

The above modifications should be considered a temporary workaround.

A permanent solution to both, is to obtain patch P025 from the HP

Response Center, or your local HP Representative.



For additional information or assistance, please contact CIAC, or your

local HP Representative.
