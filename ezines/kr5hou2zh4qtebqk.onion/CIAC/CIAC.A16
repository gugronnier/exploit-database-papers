                Vulnerability in SUN sendmail program





January 29, 1990, 0900 PST                              Number A-16



CIAC has been advised of a new vulnerability in the SUN sendmail

program.  This vulnerability (SUN bug #1028173) exists in all versions

of SUN OS (version 4.1, 4.0.3 on SUN 3, SUN 4, as well as SUN 386i

systems, for which version 4.0.2 is the most current version).  This

vulnerability has been exploited in several recent Internet breakins.



You may obtain a patch directly from SUN by calling (800) USA-4SUN, or

may obtain SUN 3 and 4 sendmail binaries using anonymous FTP from

uunet.uu.net in the /sun-fixes directory.  CIAC can also provide you

with a patch for this vulnerability.



Recent versions of UNIX systems other than SUN OS systems contain a 

sendmail fix.  CIAC encourages you to consult with your vendor about 

upgrading to a recent release if the version you are running does not 

have this fix.



If you have questions, please contact CIAC.
