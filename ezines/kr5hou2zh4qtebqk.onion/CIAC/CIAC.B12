PROBLEM:  Self-replicating mail message (worm) on external BITNET RSCS systems

PLATFORM: IBM VM/CMS 

DAMAGE: May flood the mail queue of the infected computers

IMMUNIZATION:  RSCS filter program available from IBM (at no cost)

________________________________________________________________________



CIAC has been informed of a new self-replicating mail message

currently circulating around the external BITNET.  Preliminary reports

indicate that this message, also known as a BITNET worm or trojan

horse, has been received on a number of IBM VM/CMS systems connecting

to the external BITNET.  The worm consists of a message containing a

REXX module and instructions for saving and executing the module (with

the name GAME2) in a user's local a: drive.  When executed, this

module will display a message on the screen as it sends copies of

itself to each entry in the user's CMS NAMES file.



Since this worm requires user initiation to spread, the rate of

expansion of this worm has been limited.  However, there is the

potential to flood the mail queues of IBM VM/CMS systems if the worm

becomes widespread.  The worm is similar in nature to the BITNET worm

described in CIAC bulletin B-7, and may be blocked using same RSCS

filter program described in that notice and available from IBM.

 

The worm was initially named "GAME2 MODULE" and consisted of a REXX

program that will display several messages (such as "Please

Waiting") and a simple Hello/Bye message.  While these messages are

displayed, the REXX code will send a copy of the GAME2 MODULE to each

entry in the user's NAMES file.

  

COUNTERMEASURES



As mentioned in CIAC bulletin B-7, sites running VM/CMS should install

and use the RSCS filter program (available free from IBM).  This

filter program is called the selective file filter, and was announced

in the IBM VM Software Newsletter (WSC Flash 9013).  Contact your

local IBM representative for details.  This program can scan for file

names or file types, then place them into the punch queue for later

identification and analysis.  As a minimum level of protection, all

files with the name and type of "TERM MODULE" should be examined prior

to receipt by the user.  Sites which do not routinely transmit

compiled REXX code may wish to wildcard the filename and scan for all

files with a filetype of MODULE.  This may help to protect against

future versions of the worm that might have a different file name.



We recommend that you also notify users that they should neither

receive nor execute any program without first browsing it or

discussing its operation with the sender.  The VM/CMS reader is

designed to prevent problems associated with executing unfamiliar

programs, and should be used for this purpose.  If you receive an

unknown file with a filetype of EXEC or MODULE, immediately contact

your computer security officer for information and assistance.  Please

also notify CIAC, as we wish to track any spread of this worm.
