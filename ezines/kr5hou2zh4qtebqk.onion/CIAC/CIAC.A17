                Eradicating WDEF using Disinfectant 1.5 or 1.6 



February 2, 1989, 1400 PST                                   Number A-17



 

CIAC Information Bulletin A-9 reported the existence of the WDEF virus

on Macintosh computers.  The purpose of this bulletin is to provide

additional information about eradicating this virus.



Disinfectant 1.5 and the most recent version, Disinfectant 1.6, are

capable of detecting and eradicating WDEF, but are not designed to

prevent the spread of WDEF during its execution.  If an infected disk

is inserted into the Macintosh while Disinfectant is running (for the

purposes of eradicating WDEF), WDEF will infect ANY OTHER UNLOCKED

MOUNTED VOLUMES.  If Disinfectant is to be used to eradicate a WDEF

infection, CIAC recommends the following procedure:



        1.      Prepare a system disk using locked originals.  Use the

instructions provided with the Macintosh documentation if you require

assistance in preparing this system disk.  If possible, you should not

use your hard disk to prepare this system disk.  Copy Disinfectant

version 1.5 or version 1.6 to this disk.  Lock the disk and shut down

the system.



        2.      Reboot the Macintosh using the prepared system disk.

Launch disinfectant off the floppy and use the SCAN function to check

your hard disk for the WDEF virus.  If found, use the DISINFECT

function to remove WDEF from your hard disk.  Quit disinfectant.



        3.      Reboot the Macintosh using this prepared system disk.

You should drag any hard disks that automatically appear on the

desktop to the trash to unmount them.  Launch the copy of Disinfectant

on the system disk.  Use the SCAN facility of Disinfectant to verify

that WDEF has not infected this system disk.  If it has, you will have

to eject the system disk, unlock it, and insert it again.  Use the

DISINFECT function of Disinfectant to eradicate WDEF.  Next, you

should eject the system disk and lock it again.  Reinsert the system

disk.



        4.      Use Disinfectant to scan all of your floppy disks.

WDEF will infect both system and non-system disks; to completely

eradicate WDEF you will have to disinfect all of your disks (including

backup disks).  DO NOT USE YOUR HARD DRIVE DURING THIS PROCEDURE.

  

        5.      Once all of your floppy disks are disinfected, reboot

your system using the locked system disk.  Now run Disinfectant and

disinfect your hard disk.  Once WDEF has been eradicated from all

floppies and your hard disk, the eradication procedure is complete.





The most recent versions of other tools such as SAM, VIREX,

GATEKEEPER, and GATEKEEPER AID may also be used to eradicate or

prevent the spread of the WDEF virus.  If you have questions

concerning these tools, contact CIAC for assistance.
