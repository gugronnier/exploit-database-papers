CIAC has learned of a vulnerability that allows privileged access to

files on some versions of UNIX System V running on an Intel

80386/80486 based computer. This problem known as the UAREA bug, has

been corrected by AT&T.  Most vendors of UNIX System V based on the

AT&T software have recently released patches specifically designed for

their products.  This bulletin provides a partial list of vendors that

are providing patches for this problem, as well as vendors whose

product never had the vulnerability in a specified release.



The following vulnerability matrix table lists each of vendor/version

combination for which CIAC has received information.  For each vendor,

the listed versions were tested for this vulnerability, and a patch

was developed for those versions found to be vulnerable.  If the

vendor/version combination does not exhibit the vulnerability,

"No" appears in the third column.
