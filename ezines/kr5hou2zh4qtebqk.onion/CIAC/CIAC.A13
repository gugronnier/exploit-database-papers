                Vulnerability in DECODE alias

CIAC has learned of a UNIX vulnerability in the DECODE alias.  There

is a strong possibility that this vulnerability is currently being

exploited.  One workaround is to disable the DECODE alias by

commenting out the line beginning with DECODE in either /etc/aliases

or /usr/lib/aliases.  If you do not wish to disable the DECODE alias,

you can redirect DECODE to postmaster.



If you have questions, please contact CIAC.
