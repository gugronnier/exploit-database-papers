      WASHINGTON POST SUED FOR VIOLATING SCIENTOLOGY COPYRIGHTS

      The Washington Post and two of its reporters were sued today in
 the U.S.  District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia by the
 Religious Technology Center (RTC), holders of the intellectual
 property rights of the Scientology religion.  According to the
 lawsuit, the Washington Post and its writers have engaged in
 "extensive, intentional copyright infringement and trade secrets
 misappropriattion, targeting confidential Scientology scriptures
 belonging to RTC." Judge Leonie Brinkema of the U.S.  District Court
 in Alexandria, due to the urgent nature of the matter, scheduled an
 August 25 hearing on the temporary restraining order and impoundment
 application to get the Washington Post to turn over the
 misappropriated documents.

      The lawsuit is an amendment of a complaint that was filed on
 August 11 against an Arlington man, Arnaldo Lerma, and his Internet
 access provider Digital Gateway Systems, for copyright and trade
 secrets infringement.  According to Boston lawyer Earle C.  Cooley,
 who represents Religious Technology Center, the newspaper and their
 two reporters, Richard Leiby and Marc Fisher, were added to the
 lawsuit because they engaged in their own direct infringements of
 plaintiff's copyright interests and misappropriation of plaintiff's
 trade secrets, while at the same time aiding, supporting,
 encouraging, and facilitating blatant acts of infringement and
 misappropriation by Lerma.

      The day after the lawsuit was filed, on August 12, a search and
 seizure order by Judge Brinkema was carried out at Lerma's home by
 Federal Marshals and computer software, hardware and documents were
 confiscated.  Church lawyers report that they were able to establish
 that Lerma lied because, contrary to his assertions that computer
 discs had been purged of any stolen materials, their electronic
 experts have already found 63 copyright items among the seized
 material.

      The new lawsuit reveals that Lerma sent the protected materials
 to Leiby when he was put on notice by the Church to stop violating
 its copyright and trade secret rights.  The Church now charges that
 this was done in an attempt to obstruct justice by concealing the
 stolen copies from lawful seizure.  The suit claims the existence of
 evidence which shows that Richard Leiby choreographed and instigated
 Lerma's illegal conduct for his own campaign of harassment against
 the Scientology religion.  According to the lawsuit, Leiby's
 campaign dates back more than 15 years.

      Church spokeswoman Leisa Goodman said "The Washington Post and
 Mr. Leiby violated fundamental journalistic integrity by conspiring
 with lawless elements on the Internet to harm the religion of
 Scientology."

      Once the Church became aware that its materials were in the
 possession of Richard Leiby, it demanded their immediate return.
 Leiby and the Washington Post handed the stolen copies over to RTC's
 lawyers last week on August 15.  However, "the return of the
 materials, a seeming display of good faith, was an utter ruse", the
 complaint states.  "At the same time that the materials were being
 returned to the Church in Washington, Leiby, Fisher and the Post
 were getting copies of the same stolen records from the clerk's file
 in LA where litigation was pending regarding the sealing of such
 materials.  A Post reporter persuaded the clerk's office to take the
 documents away from a Church employee who had checked out the file,
 to make copies for the Post," the complaint continues.

      The Church reacted with an emergency motion to the judge on the
 case in Los Angeles, who immediately ordered the entire case file
 sealed on August 15, when he was told that the Washington Post had
 obtained a copy of the copyrighted and trade secret materials.

      According to the lawsuit, the Church immediately demanded the
 materials back and also put the post on notice "that its actions
 could not remotely be deemed news gathering, but rather constituted
 wholesale copying of a large amount of copyrighted trade secret
 information in an attempt to sanitize the illicit acquisition of
 infringing documents which Leiby and the Post concealed on Lerma's
 behalf."

      Church spokeswoman Goodman discounted the notion that any free
 speech or fair-use issues were involved.  "Violators of copyright
 and trade secret laws traditionally try to hide behind free speech
 or fair-use claims.  The Church is a strong proponent of free speech
 and fair-use.  It publishes its own investigative magazine and
 cherishes the First Amendment.  However, free speech or fair-use
 does not mean free theft and no one, the Washington Post included,
 has the right to cloak themselves in the First Amendment to break
 the law."

      Despite repeated warnings from Church lawyers, last Saturday
 the Washington Post published a lengthy article by Marc Fisher,
 which included quotes from the copyrighted, trade secret materials.
 "Prior to publication of the article, the defendants were placed on
 notice that their actions would constitute a violation of
 plaintiff's rights," said Goodman.

      "The Post made a serious mistake," RTC's lawyer Earle C.
 Cooley contends, "in allowing themselves to be manipulated by a few
 maliciously motivated dissidents who want to use the Post to forward
 their religious hate campaign.  The courts take these matters very
 seriously.  The law is clear: If you are going to violate
 copyrights, you will have to answer for it in court.  This applies
 to the Washington Post just as much as to anyone else."

      With this lawsuit, Religious Technology Center is asking the
 court to order the return of its documents by the Washington Post
 and grant a permanent injunction against the Post and the individual
 violators of its rights.  It also seeks statutory damages and
 punitive damages.

Subject: File 2--Comments on Beverly LaHaye Live

Not too long ago, there was posted a transcript of a particular Beverly
LaHaye Live, a syndicated christian radio program.  And as a conservative
christian, I'd like to say, for the record, that the episode can be summed
up in one word:  "sensationalism."  This sensationalism manifests itself
thoughout in factual innaccuracies and ommissions, in misused
emotionally-loaded language, and in a decidely lopsided approach.

In the way of inaccuracies, Pat Truman, several times, fails to stress the
legal difference between indecency and obscenity.  He says that the Internet
is "a highway, literally, from your computer to _every other computer in the
world_."  He says that if your computer isn't connected to the Internet,
"your neighbor's computer probably is, your school computer is," making Net
connections appear almost as common as telephones.  He says that the
Thomases of Amateur Action BBS were convicted of "putting pornography on the
Internet," even though the Internet never came into their case.

But the single pervasive element throughout was alarmism.  The gist of the
entire show can be interpreted:  "The porn-meisters are coming.  Everybody
panic and lock your young ones in a closet."  This, in my opinion, is simply
not true.


Beverly LaHaye opens by saying, "And thanks to the Information Superhighway,
pornography could be invading your home without you even knowing it. The
challenge for parents today is finding ways to keep their children from
being exposed to these vulgar influences."  I would re-word this:  "The open
environment of the Internet allows adult material, as well as non-adult
material, to be freely circulated.  Parents who want to place limits on what
their children can access may find it a challenge."  Phrased thusly, I would
agree with the sentiment.

It may be factually true that "pornography could be invading your home
without you even knowing it."  But the path of least resistence is still
education rather than legislation.  I must further disagree with the
implication that the ignorance of parents is the fault of "the Information
Superhighway."  Is it not true that, no matter what controls are in place,
it is the responsibility of parents to monitor their childrens' development?

Moreover, I don't think that pornography is the only issue.  The concern,
broadly speaking, is that children will get ahold of adult material.  But is
it not the responsibility -- and the right -- of each child's parents to
judge, as they see fit, what is or is not suitable for their kids?

I would recommend consideration of some simple, common-sense steps.  Take an
interest in the email conversations your child has with others.  Do you take
an interest in your child's friends?  Take an interest in his Internet
aquaintances, too.  Make sure your child understands a few rules:  Don't
tell anyone on the Internet your address, telephone number, or age.  Don't
agree to meet, in person, anyone you meet, electronically, on the Internet.
And make sure to tell Mom or Dad if anyone says anything you're not
comfortable with via email.  And don't talk to, take candy from, or get into
a car with a stranger.  I would also suggest parents take a look at
<http://www.crc.ricoh.com/people/steve/warn-kids.html> and
<http://silver.ucs.indiana.edu/~lchampel/netadv.htm>.

One suggestion Mr. Truman presents, which sounds like a good one to me, is
to put the computer in the kitchen, in the den, or in the living room, where
everybody can see it.  Surely this will make a child think twice about
actively seeking off-limits materials, and it will provide a way for the
child's parents to keep an eye on him.

Of course, Mr. Truman, true to form, can't leave well enough alone.  He also
suggests keeping the computer away from phone lines, "because this is all
transacted by plugging your computer into a phone line. And every computer
is equipped with that..."  Even if the computer has a modem and it is
plugged into the phone line, the child would have to (1) obtain and (2)
install appropriate software and (3) learn how to use it.  Additionally, he
must (4) obtain an Internet account.  It is unfathomable that a child could
covertly connect to the Internet, not having previously been given all of
what is needed to accomplish the task.  I'm not trying to underestimate the
concern this may still be for some parents, but these facts would probably
have put some parents' minds at ease, had Mr. Truman cared to point them out.


Pat Truman correctly points out the future for pornography is over the
Internet.  The future for civilization in general is over the Internet.
Although I share his conviction concerning technology, however, I don't
share his alarm.  It is not surprising to me that extant materials and
practices are being adapted to the Internet.  The presence of pornography on
the Internet is no more surpising than that of library card catalogs, gift
baskets, and record shops.

But Mr. Truman says, "I was shocked. I've been in the worst pornography
shops in Manhattan, downtown New York, on investigations, and anything I saw
there was available on the Internet...  It's hard to believe that people
would record sexual acts and put them on the Internet..."  I don't know why
he was shocked.  Did he actually think that the Internet was a moral
safe-haven, sheltered from humanity?  Is he really _that_ naive?  Is it
really that hard to believe, knowing that people record sexual acts and put
them on paper and video, that they would do the same over the Internet?  I
find Mr. Truman's reaction difficult to accept.  Maybe he was disgusted, but
not shocked.  Nevertheless, far be it from me to try to second-guess his
thoughts.  If he says he was shocked...  Well...


He points to "a problem that is very much related to pornography, it's these
obscene conversations that you can have - worldwide conversations, you can
talk to someone... and have a _terrible_ conversation. There are no age
limits. And, uh, it's all..."

Uh, yeah.  Uh...  He never specifies to which "obscene conversations" he's
referring.  Nonetheless, how do "_terrible_" -- ~shiver~ -- "worldwide
conversations" differentiate the Internet from the telephone?  And if I want
to talk dirty with my wife -- or with anyone else -- what does that have to
do with pornography?  For the concerns about children, see my comments above.


Ms. LaHaye is concerned that the kids will "go over to Johnny's house to
spend the afternoon, and Johnny's got a computer and knows how to enter all
this, and here these two boys _play_ with this kind of _porn_!"  And the
same hypothetical Johnny probably has a Hustler magazine under his mattress.
Now, my parents took care to be informed concerning my friends.  They wanted
to know where I was, what I was doing, and with whom I was doing it.  Any
parent who doesn't take the same care in raising their children has, at
least partially, himself to blame for their friends' influence.

Mr. Truman says, "You can buy software as a parent that will block this
material... So these access providers now say, ... go buy something for 50
bucks... And my position is, ... _you_ provide the software..."  This is a
most naive view.  Does Mr. Truman honestly think that, even if service
providers were forced to provide blocking software, users would not be
charged?  I can just see the $50 installation fees, even for those user's
that could rather go without.

He says, "I had a high school librarian in Seattle, Washington call me the
other day because she [used] the Internet Yellow Pages [to find the] US
Government, Executive Branch, Clinton Cabinet.  You dial that in, you get
obscene work, after obscene work, after obscene work."  Huh?  Is this
supposed to be some sort of a dumb political joke?


But the one that took the cake, the most moving of all -- so moving, in
fact, that I thought I would heave -- is the following sequence:

"But the reason I criticized the Exon bill... is that he would give immunity
from prosecution from the major pornography _profiteers_...  The person who
put [the porn] on the Internet didn't charge for it. But _Netcom_, or
America OnLine, or these others, _will_ charge you...  Some people spend
hundreds and hundreds of dollars viewing it, and some of those people are
children...  the pornographer profiteers today are the people who give you
access to the Internet...  And they know that material's there, they know
that's why thousands and thousands of people subscribe every month to their
services, that is in order to get pornography.  So the pornography
profiteers today are the access providers, like Netcom, CompuServe, etc."

Hundreds and hundreds of dollars?  I think you need a new ISP.  And some
children spend this much?  Don't their parents wonder about the bill?
Thousands and thousands of people?  Name six.  And, by the way, since you
have all of these nifty statistics at your fingertips, what percentage of
all Internet users does that "thousands and thousands" represent?

I most strongly contest the labelling of Internet service providers as
"pornography profiteers."  This is a most inaccurate description when
applied to practially all, if not all, ISPs.  There can be no excuse for the
utterance of such ignorant and careless hogwash.  ISPs charge for Internet
access, not for pornography.  From their perspective, if you choose to
access pornography, that's your business.  I don't know of any ISPs that
don't charge the same rate regardless of whether one accesses Penthouse
magazine or The Christian Coalition's Home Page.


You guys, take a step back and stop making a mockery out of issues we --
christians, U.S. citizens, and conservatives -- hold dear.

This is an unmoderated list maintained by Texas A&M University. Its purpose is
to promote the discussion and use of firewalls and other security tools in an
academic environment. It is complementary to the Firewalls list maintained by
Brent Chapman (send subscription requests to Majordomo@GreatCircle.COM) which
deals primarily with firewall issues in a commercial environment. Academic
environments have different political structures, ethical issues, expectations
of privacy and expectations of access.

Many documented incidents of cracker intrusions have either originated at or
passed through academic institutions. The security at most universities is
notoriously lax or even in some cases completely absent. Most institutions
don't use firewalls because they either don't care about their institution's
security, they feel firewalls are not appropriate or practical, or they don't
know the extent to which they are under attack from the Internet.

At Texas A&M University we have been using a combination of a flexible packet
filter, intrusion detection tools, and Unix security audit utilities for almost
two years. We have found that simple firewalls combined with other tools are
feasible in an academic environment. Hopefully the discussion on this list will
begin to raise the awareness of other institutions also.

REASONS FOR INCEPTION

In order to compile the average security administrator it was found that the
compiler had to parse a foreboding number of exceptionally noisy and
semantically-content-free data sets. This led to exceptionally high load
averages and a dramatic increase in core entropy.

Further, the number, names and locations of this data appears to change on an
almost daily basis; requiring tedious version control on the part of the mental
maintainer. Best-of-Security is at present an un-moderated list. That may sound
strange given our stated purpose of massive entropy reduction; but because best
often equates with "vital" and the moderator doesn't have an MDA habit it is
important that material sent to this list be delivered to its subscribers' in
as minimal period of time as is (in)humanly possible.

If you find *any* information from *any* source (including other mailinglists,
newsgroups, conference notes, papers, etc) that fits into one of the acceptable
categories described at the end of this document then you should *immediately*
send it to "best-of-security@suburbia.net". Do not try and predict whether or
not someone else will send the item in question to the list in the immediate
future. Unless your on a time-delayed mail vector such as polled uucp or the
item has already appeared on best-of-security, mail the info to the list! Even
if it is a widely deployed peice of information such as a CERT advisory the
proceeding argument still applies. If the information hasn't appeared on this
list yet, then SEND IT. It is far better to run the risk of minor duplication
in exchange for having the information out where it is needed than act
conservatively about occasional doubling up on content.

The Sneakers mailing list is for discussion of LEGAL evaluations and
experiments in testing various Internet "firewalls" and other TCP/IP network
security products.

   *  Vendors are welcome to post challenges to the Internet network security
     community
   *  Internet users are welcome to post anecdotal experiences regarding
     (legally) testing the defenses of firewall and security products.
   *  "Above board" organized and/or loosely organized wide area tiger teams
     (WATTs) can share information, report on their progress or eventual
     success here.

There is a WWW page with instructions on un/subscribing as well as posting, and
where notices and pointers to resources (especially if I set up an archive of
this list) may be put up from time to time:

Virus

To join, send e-mail to LISTSERV@lehigh.edu and, in the text of your message
(not the subject line), write:

     SUBSCRIBE virus-l your-name

It is an electronic mail discussion forum for sharing information and ideas
about computer viruses, which is also distributed via the Usenet Netnews as
comp.virus. Discussions should include (but not necessarily be limited to):
current events (virus sightings), virus prevention (practical and theoretical),
and virus related questions/answers. The list is moderated and digested. That
means that any message coming in gets sent to me, the editor. I read through
the messages and make sure that they adhere to the guidelines of the list (see
below) and add them to the next digest. Weekly logs of digests are kept by the
LISTSERV (see below for details on how to get them). For those interested in
statistics, VIRUS-L is now up to about 2400 direct subscribers. Of those,
approximately 10% are local redistribution accounts with an unknown number of
readers. In addition, approximately 30,000-40,000 readers read comp.virus on
the USENET.

Virus Alert

To join, send e-mail to LISTSERV@lehigh.edu and, in the text of your message
(not the subject line), write:

     SUBSCRIBE valert-l your-name

What is VALERT-L?

It is an electronic mail discussion forum for sharing urgent virus warnings
among other computer users. Postings to VALERT-L are strictly limited to
warnings about viruses (e.g., "We here at University/Company X just got hit by
virus Y - what should we do?"). Followups to messages on VALERT-L should be
done either by private e-mail or to VIRUS-L, a moderated, digested, virus
discussion forum also available on this LISTSERV, LISTSERV@LEHIGH.EDU. Note
that any message sent to VALERT-L will be cross-posted in the next VIRUS-L
digest. To preserve the timely nature of such warnings and announcements, the
list is moderated on demand (see posting instructions below for more
information).

What VALERT-L is *not*?

A place to to anything other than announce virus infections or warn people
about particular computer viruses (symptoms, type of machine which is
vulnerable, etc.).
