A Cyber Liberties Alert

from the ACLU

Urge Your Online Service Providers to Fight the Modified Exon/Gorton
Amendment!

As you know from our previous Cyber Liberties Alerts, Congress is moving to
dramatically restrict the free speech and privacy rights of online users.
On March 23, 1995, the Senate Commerce Committee approved the Exon/Gorton
bill (the so-called "Communications Decency Act", also known as S.314) as
an amendment to the Telecommunications Competition and Deregulation Act of
1995.

While the proposed legislation was modified to include some defenses from
criminal liability for online service providers, users are still very much
at risk of both massive fines and imprisonment.

The ACLU has written an open letter to online providers, copied below, that
urges them to wage a full-scale fight for the rights of online users.  Some
providers are still actively standing up for your rights while others may
not be.  There are still opportunities to fight the legislation in both
House and Senate, but the fight will not succeed without the concerted
efforts of online users, civil libertarians, and online service providers.
Remember that the Senate Commerce Committee approved the Exon/Gorton
amendment despite opposition letters and petition signatures from over
100,000 online users.

ACT NOW:

Write to your online service providers and ask them to make a public
declaration against the Exon/Gorton amendment and to push aggressively for
the greatest amount of free speech and privacy for online users.  (A sample
letter is attached.)

Please copy your letter to the following e-mail address: infoaclu@aclu.org.


In addition, continue to voice your opposition to the Exon/Gorton Amendment
to members of the Senate Commerce Committee and your own senators.  See our
previous ACLU Cyber Liberties Alerts for instructions on how to reach the
Senate: gopher://aclu.org:6601.

An Open Letter to Online Providers Regarding the Exon/Gorton

March 28, 1995

On March 23, 1995, the Senate Commerce Committee voted to violate the civil
liberties of every present and future member of the online community.  The
so-called "Communications Decency Act" was modified to include some
defenses from criminal liability -- but these are available only to online
service providers.  In fact, other modifications made the legislation worse
for users.  The Exon/Gorton amendment remains a blatant violation of the
free speech and privacy guarantees of the Constitution.

We therefore urge all online providers to continue (or, if necessary, to
begin) a full-scale fight for the rights of online users against the
government interference embodied in the Exon/Gorton amendment.

The Exon/Gorton amendment subjects online users to surveillance and imposes
criminal penalties for messages deemed by some government official to be
"indecent, lewd, lascivious or filthy" -- all communications protected by
the First Amendment.  By criminalizing the content of private messages, it
would invite active interference in the basic speech of everyone using a
telecommunications device.

The amendment was attached to the Telecommunications Competitionand
Deregulation Act of 1995, which was approved by the Commerce Committee and
is being sent for consideration to the Senate floor.  There are still
opportunities to fight the legislation in both House and Senate, but the
fight will not succeed without the concerted efforts of online users, civil
libertarians, and online service providers.

Sexual expression has been a fundamental part of human communication from
the beginning of recorded history.  The online community is no different.
There is no question that talk about sex and the exchange of sexual images
has contributed to the vibrant quality of online communications, and an
increasing number of online subscribers.  And Congress need not ban
constitutionally protected forms of speech in order to protect children
from sexually explicit materials.

Interactive technologies allow users -- including concerned parents -- to
have more control over content than any previous communications medium.
Many of the traditional arguments for restricting sexually expressive
material, such as radio/TV's assault on unwilling listeners or the fear
that a child will wander into an adult bookstore, simply do not apply to
interactive technologies.

Moreover, the Exon/Gorton amendment's censorial sweep encompasses content
that has nothing to do with sex -- anything deemed "indecent" or "filthy"
-- subjective terms that could apply to any message outside the mainstream.
 The amendment would make the online community one of the most censored
segments of communications media when logic dictates that it should be the
least censored.

The Exon/Gorton amendment also subjects an industry that has blossomed
without government control to an unprecedented amount of interference and
intrusion.

We applaud those online providers who have both publicly declared their
opposition to the Exon/Gorton amendment and who continue to fight for the
constitutional rights of their subscribers.  These providers recognize that
no one in the online community will benefit from an amendment that
seriously threatens the free flow of information and the diversity of
content transmitted over online networks.

To achieve the liberating potential of the information superhighway,
Congress must ensure that interactive technologies enhance rather than
stifle democratic values like user choice.

We therefore call upon ALL online service providers to join online users
and civil libertarians in the fight against the Exon/Gorton amendment.  We
urge online service providers to make a public declaration against the
amendment and to push aggressively for the greatest amount of free speech
and privacy for online users.

               ------------------------------------------------
SAMPLE LETTER
Dear [name of each of your online service providers]:

I am writing, as a user of your service, to urge you to make a public
declaration against the Exon/Gorton amendment to the Telecommunications
Competition and Deregulation Act of 1995. While providing defenses from
criminal liability for online providers, the Exon proposal leaves online
users at risk of large fines and imprisonment for constitutionally
protected speech.

I urge you to:

*Make a public declaration against the Exon proposal.

*Aggressively lobby the Senate to vote against the Exon proposal, and
aggressively lobby to prevent similar proposals in the House version of the
telecommunications reform legislation.

*Continue to push for the greatest amount of free speech and privacy for
online users.

Sincerely,

[name]

Subject: File 3--"Hackers Sentences in Telephone Fraud"

From: Chicago Tribune, 26 March, 1995: Section 1: p. 12

WINSTON-SALEM, N.C.--Two computer hackers have been sentenced to
federal prison for a scheme that defrauded long-distance telephone
carriers of more than $28 million.  Ivey James Lay, 29, and Frank
Ronald Stanton, 22, were part of a ring that stole credit card numbers
from MCI, where Lay was an employee, the government said. Lay was
sentenced Friday to 3 years and 2 months in prison; Stanton was
sentenced to one year. The credit-card numbers were used to charge
long-distance calls to computer bulletin-board systems and computer
chat lines. They were part of a group that bought and sold at least
50,000 numbers from 1992 until the summer of 1994.

Subject: File 4--writing project on Pacific Northwest hackers

Dear Editors,

I'm a fourth year student at Evergreen State College and am looking
for hackers who would like to participate in an ethnography or oral
interview project.  The program I'm in is called "True Stories and how
they are told" and the project is worth 8 quarter credit hours.

I'm currently looking to interview 4 to 8 people who live in Western
Washington and are accessible by bus (obviously, I don't have a car).
I'm interested in those who do not identify themselves with the media
stereotype of the teenage (Elvira skinned) boy who is allergic to
sunlight.

The interviews can last from one to four hours and I can sign
anominity forms if desired.  As a woman, I'd like to interview at
least one woman hacker but realize that the overwhelming majority are
male.  Originally, I had written editor Emmanuel Goldstein (at "2600")
for help but his spring issue has already gone out and I was unable to
put in a reader ad for my project.

Participants may talk about anything of concern to them including
their families, philosphy, privacy, and favorite color.

If you know of anyone who would be interested (and who is a regular
reader of "2600"), please let me know how I can contact them, or you
may give them my e-mail address at "leej@elwha.evergreen.edu".

If you have any questions or know of other groups (including BBS) that
I can contact, please let me know.

Thank you,

Joomi Lee

Subject: File 6--Call for Participants in WWW Interdisc. Mailing List

WANTED:  Participants for a mailing list.  20-30 individuals who enjoy
trouble shooting issues for the sake of doing it.  Specifically I would
like to find individuals interested in Government, Sociology, Politics,
Law, Economics, and Business. These are just interest areas, you do not
have to be an expert in these fields (I'm not). Just be a 'thinker' and have
an interest in what we are trying to accomplish.

PROJECT:  To debate, discuss and author a document to be published on the
WWW.  This document will be a more or less academic project to create a
Constitution for governing a country in todays cultural, technical,
economic, etc environment, with the goal of creating a Constitution that
would have staying power far into the future.  All participants will be
given credit for authoring and it will (should) be a fun project.
Finally, this is a study, not a revolutionary document in any way.  I am
not interested in anybody who would use  this project to
forward any political agenda.  When/if the project is complete I think it
would be fun to run some case studies based on real news events to test
practicality and to generally see how good of job we did.

SCOPE:  This document will primarily be philosophical.  I want to start
out at the most fundamental definitions of what government should be.  As
interest and our whims take us we could cover Criminal Law, Business Law,
Cultural issues, Trade, External Relations, ad infinitum.

INTERESTED?:  Please send an email to gander@mail.cox.smu.edu (if you see
this on a usenet newsgroup I WILL NOT be checking these groups for
responses YOU MUST EMAIL ME).  In this email please include your name,
email address, why you are interested in this project, and how your
interests apply to this project.  I am planning to begin list serving the
first week of April with the question what should be the fundamental goal
of government, and verification of and additions to (?) the inalienable
rights as currently documented. Once this forum is started it will be a
closed discussion with new members added by invitation only.  If you are
interested respond NOW.

ME:  As an avid science fiction fan and trouble shooter I have always been
interested in how s/f writers handled the governments of the future.
During some recent studies I have been wondering how our government will
apply our current constitution to current technological trends in
communications (ie, the net).  History has shown (IMHO) that major changes
in communication have always proven significant to government.  I am
interested in discussion on how much our current government (and the
government of the near future) is equiped via our Constitution and current
policies to deal with this new communication medium where a very real
culture is being formed and laws cannot be so readily enforcable due
to cultural/legal differences.


IF THIS SOUNDS INTERESTING TO YOU PLEASE RESPOND, I THINK THIS COULD BE A
LOT OF FUN AND MAY EVEN BE ABLE VIA OUR TEXT TO OPEN SOME EYES TO ISSUES
THAT WILL BE FORTHCOMING IN OUR EVOLUTION AS A TECHNO SOCIETY/CULTURE. IF YOU
HAVE ANY MORE QUESTIONS DON'T HESITATE TO EMAIL ME AT gander@mail.cox.smu.edu.

Thanks for your time,
Gerald D. Anderson

Subject: File 9--Announce: Telepoetics UK-Chicago event

                                CAFELINK

                      presents a TELEPOETICS event

                            Sunday April 9th

                 Hosted in Cambridge, UK, by Mark Cheverton,
                    and in Chicago, USA, by Kurt Heintz.

         A live videophone linkup between the Underground Media Lab
in Chicago and the CB1 cafe in Cambridge, England, as part of Chicago's
fourth Poetry Video Festival, sponsored in Chicago by The Guild Complex. Poets
at both ends will be performing to an audience on two continents, linking
both venues and cultures.

         The event will commence at 7:30pm BST (1:30pm CDT, USA) on
the 9th of April. If you intend to come along please drop us an EMail
so we can keep track of numbers.

        Chicago will also be connecting with the Western Front arts
space in Vancouver at 9:00pm CDT (7:00pm PDT), for more information
contact the people involved.

* What is Telepoetics?

        Telepoetics is a direct cultural link built upon low cost video
conferencing technology. Poets and performers exchange their art between
two distant sites to form an artistic communion across cultural and
geographic borders.

        Although videophones are used regularly across the world, the
technology is still expensive. The Telepoetics group use basic and
cheap video technology to join sites for cultural exchanges,
the quality may not be as good as the top of the range systems seen
elsewhere, but it has the advantage of being within the reach of the
poets who've built the Telepoetics events heretofore in Canada and
the US, and in reach of the general public.

        For a deeper background on the Telepoetics movement, visit Kurt
Heintz's homepage on the World Wide Web.

* What is Cafelink?

        Cafelink is a recently formed organisation which brings
together Internet cafes, video experts and anyone involved in
communication worldwide. Our aim is to foster links with groups
such as Telepoetics, using the Internet and other communication
technologies to bring together these geographically diverse sites
and encourage exposure to other cultures.

* What is the Poetry Video Festival?

        Organized in Chicago in 1991, the National Poetry Video Festival
has showcased poetry in electronic media on an ever-widening program. Each
year poetry videos are gathered, juried, and screened before broader
audiences. This year, the Festival will showcase numerous works of poets
and media artists from the United States and Canada ( its first
"international" screening ), and continues its commitment to literate
video produced by and for young people. The Festival will afford local
audiences a sneak preview of the series "The United States of Poetry",
scheduled to debut nationally on PBS ( USA ) produced by poet and director
Bob Holman of New York ( The NuYorican Poets' Cafe ).

        Telepoetics returns to this year's Festival with its first
international connections to both Cambridge, England, ( the CB1 Cafe ) and
Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, ( the Edgewise Cafe ) from Chicago.
