Subject: File 1--Intro to Jim Warren Special Issue

Jim Warren's contributions to cyberspace are well known to
old-timers. Newcomers, however, might not be aware that he is
probably the person most singularly responsible for pushing
state and federal government toward Net accessibility, for
keeping us all abreast of critical government-access issues,
and for generally serving as a conduit for timely news and
information about legislation and policy issues of cyber-relevance.

Because of time and space, we can't always run as much of Jim's
work as we'd like. But, with an occasional special issue, we can
share is works with both new-comers and his long-time fans.

Subject: File 2--GovAccess.098v2: ACTION NEEDED ASAP! re public access to fed rc
ds

This needs action THIS WEEK!

[Apologies if you who are on the regular GovAccess list receive more
than one copy of this.  It's HIGHLY TIME-SENSITIVE.  I sent it
yesterday morning to my new automated listserv but apparently it's
bottled-up somewhere.  So, I am resending it via my old, semi-manual
GovAccess distribution system.]

This concerns an information-supressing amendment that is being jambed
through Congress *FAST* - probably THIS WEEK - by powerful lobbyists who
have spent a fortune on this and apparently don't *want* any careful public
deliberative process, much less a fair opportunity for public input.

It not only voids public access to federal court records in their modern
form; it severely endangers the now-potent federal Freedom of Information
Act (FOIA).

This is longer than usual about a single topic because it is an EMERGENCY
ACTION ALERT and needs to provide adequate information on which to base an
informed decision, and the contact-information needed for *immediate*
effective action.

Jim, read the whole post and take a special look at the 'graph below:

>Indeed, if Oliver North had used
>a private contractor for the White House email system, those

>

I wouldn't be surprised if White House aides were already using a private
system for some sensitive records. Just a hunch. At any rate you can bet
that officials from both parties won't shy away from taking advantage of
this loophole if it opens up. Thanks to telnet, ftp and whatnot, of course,
the contractor's computers could be anywhere. For all I know, maybe the
contractor could be outside the country (I haven't any idea what the
procurement regs would say on this).

I'd love to find out about Gingrich's own possible involvement in the bill.
It mocks everything he's said about the need for electronic democracy.

Having fought some pretty nasty FOIA battles in my time, I feel a little too
much deju vu.

Be interesting to see what the White House policy is on this stuff. I won't
get my hopes up. This could well be a bipartisan effort against the citizenry.

>had a copy of the database, it could not dissmeinate the records
>without the consent of LEXIS.  Likewise, many databases, such as

GovAccess About to Move to an Automated Listserv  [details real soon now]

I am about to switch GovAccess from my current, masochistic, semi-manual
operation, to a standard-style, automated listserv - as soon as I finish
updating its addressee lists.  This should be completed within a day or
two.

At that time, I will announce details in the next GovAccess, sent this ol'
fashioned way, and send a test-message to the new listserv.  If it and I
survive the transition, the changeover will be complete by mid-week.  --jim


&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&


First You Have to Get Their Attention ...
[IT MIGHT BE USEFUL TO CIRCULATE THIS WIDELY!]

As of mid-January, ten of the nation's 100 Senators and about half of the
U.S. Representatives had public email addresses.

But it's *widely* known that many local, state and federal elected
officials and their staff routinely ignore or functionally-disregard
communications that come from anyone other than (a) people in their
districts, (b) "important" people and (c) lobbyists and donors, anywhere.


Email provides an interesting option:

1.  Your email addr often gives little indication of where you are located
- especially on those systems that have national and global users.

2.  Your eaddr rarely gives any indication of whether you are "important" -
leaving the possibility open that you *may* have numerous contacts in an
elected representative's district ... all the more possible, once
politicians begin to realize that the Internet provides us with free, fast
global broadcasting.

So - if you don't help 'em identify how inconsequential you are, and don't
tell 'em that you live somewhere far-distant from their voters ... then
they may be more-likely to consider your comments as *possibly* being from
one of their constituents, and *possibly* from someone who can influence
voters in their district.

Their attention to your comments is appropriate - regardless of where in
the nation you live - since their votes usually impact *all* citizens,
pervasively.  (This - and the issues of freedom of expression - are also
worth keeping in mind, when we are tempted to seek prohibitions against
out-of-district political donations and "outsider" campaign assistance.)

MuniNet - FinanceNet's List for City Managers

Mon, 30 Jan 1995 17:08:27 CST
From: brich@nsf.gov

FinanceNet has recently added a new public listserv mailing list,
coordinated by the International Institute of Municipal Clerks, titled
"MuniNet". This is a distribution and discussion list for issues relating
to financial accountability and stewardship of municipalities, towns and
townships within larger geopolitical jurisdictions. As in the
"state-county" list, documents and discussions will broadly relate to
accounting matters, bonds, revenues and taxation, budgets, systems, fees,
licenses, audits, controls, payroll, and all other issues of interest to
clerks, and other local gov't financial management staff and taxpayers.
This list will also provide a communications medium for the membership and
agenda issues for the International Institute of Municipal Clerks, and
other local gov't professional organizations.

To subscribe to the MuniNet list, send the email message (no subject
necessary) to listproc@financenet.gov with the following in the BODY:

   SUBSCRIBE MuniNet yourfirstname yourlastname

   For example:  subscribe MuniNet John Doe

You will be automatically subscribed and receive user instructions by
return email.

FinanceNet is an independent public Internet network established by Vice
President Gore's National Performance Review in Washington, D.C. and
operated by the National Science Foundation. FinanceNet reaches across
geopolitical boundaries to link taxpayers and gov't financial management
staff worldwide to catalyze continuous improvements in govt's stewardship
and accountability of taxpayer resources.

FinanceNet seeks to achieve these goals by (1) encouraging dialog for the
sharing of ideas, best practices and successes through subscriptions to a
series of public Internet mail lists and discussion forums, and (2) by
providing an instantly available electronic library of financial
information on gopher and World Wide Web Internet servers to empower
government financial operations staff to make more effective decisions.

For complete information on all FinanceNet services send a blank Internet
e-mail message to:

                        info@financenet.gov

For more specific information on the many FinanceNet Internet mail lists,
send a blank e-mail message (no subject necessary) to:

                     email-info@financenet.gov

You will automatically receive a response by return e-mail with complete
details.

Virginia *ACTION ALERT*!!: Feb.4th Vote on Access to State Legislative Info

Date: Thu, 02 Feb 1995 15:22:33 -0500 (EST)
From: "Richard P. Klau" <KLAURICH@uofrlaw.urich.edu>

I've sent the following announcement out to Usenet - it slipped through two
committees w/o so much as a voice against it. Also, it has been upgraded to
a "prototype" bill, or whatever they call it - now, instead of a study, it
would require the creation of a prototype of the system to then be
implemented for full access in the next term.

The Virginia General Assembly is about to vote on House Joint Resolution
482, named "Internet Study" by its sponsor, Delegate Steve Newman.  HJ 482
was originally intended to be a "study bill" which would have required a
study of the feasability of providing Internet access to Virginia's
legislative information.

However, HJ 482 has been "upgraded" so that if it passes, the State will be
required to develop a prototype of such a system. If successful, the
prototype would be converted to a full system for Virginians in the next
legislative session.

The bill is on the floor of the House of Delegates and debate will occur on
Saturday, February 4, 1995. A vote will most likely take place on Monday,
February 6, 1995.

Delegate Newman's legislative aide Curt Diemer indicates that the general
reaction to the bill has been positive. However, there has been no
indication to the General Assembly that Virginians like you and me will
actually use such a system.

WHAT YOU CAN DO

The General Assembly has one fax number for the Delegates. If you do not
know who your Delegate is, call Delegate Newman's office and ask Curt
Diemer who represents your area.  Fax your Delegate stating your support of
HJ 482, and state why - *briefly*. [One page is about the right length. -j]

This has to happen NOW! The vote will happen within a few days. The Fax
number for the House of Delegates is: (804)786-6310

If you have any more questions about this bill, please feel free to contact
me. A listserv at the Electronic Frontier Foundation is in the process of
being set up and I will send information out once it is finalized.

[This seems to be moving *awfully* fast by legislative standards.  Hmmm.
BEWARE!!! - Two major potential "gotchas:  Someone needs to check the exact
text in this bill *immediately* - to make sure that it explicitly
*prohibits* any state agency from charging access fees for access to these
crucial public legislative records, and that it explicitly *permits* re-use
and re-distribution of copies of any and all such records as soon as they
are made available, for free or for fee, by individuals, publishers,
nonprofit organizations and commercial entrepreneurs.  --jim]

IRS Initiates Massive New Database - Item [6] from the EPIC Alert (below)

On December 20, the Internal Revenue Service announced in the Federal
Register that it was planning a new database to monitor compliance of
taxpayers in a project entitled Compliance 2000. The database would contain
information on all individuals in the U.S. who conduct certain financial
transactions and would be segmented by different criteria:

        Any individual who has business and/or financial
        activities. These may be grouped by industry, occupation,
        or financial transactions, included in commercial
        databases, or in information provided by state and local
        licensing agencies.

The new database will combine private and public sector databases in a
single searchable entity. A number of federal financial databases from the
IRS will be enhanced with state, local and commercial sources. The Federal
Register notice describes the non-tax databases:

        Examples of other information would include data
        from commercial databases, any state's Department
        of Motor Vehicles (DMV), credit bureaus, state and
        local real estate records, commercial publications,
        newspapers, airplane and pilot information, U.S.
        Coast Guard vessel registration information, any
        state's Department of Natural Resources
        information, as well as other state and local
        records.  In addition, Federal government databases
        may also be accessed, such as, federal employment
        files, federal licensing data, etc.

Finally, even though the proposed system would use frequently inaccurate
"commercial databases" such as direct marketing records, taxpayers would
not be able to review their records to ensure that they are accurate and up
to date: "This system is exempt from the access and contest provisions of
the Privacy Act."

EPIC is filing comments asking the IRS to reconsider its use of commercial
databases and to ensure that there are greater safeguards on the collection
and use of personal information.

A copy of the Federal Register notice is available at cpsr.org
/cpsr/privacy/epic/IRS_compliance_2000_notice_txt Comments on the proposed
system must be received by January 19, 1995, and sent to Office of
Disclosure, Internal Revenue Service, 1111 Conn. Ave, NW, Washington, DC
20224. EPIC's Comments are available at cpsr.org

Congressional Vectors in Database Format - Available by FTP

Sat, 28 Jan 1995 17:50:36 -0800 (PST)
>From "Janet E. Harrison" <tat@well.sf.ca.us>

I have put together databases in various file formats for the House and
the Senate.  I have sent them to Jeff Chan for putting into his ftp
directory.  The files include fields for LName, FName, Party, State,
District, Chamber, Room, OfficeBuilding, Zip, email, voicephone, and
fax.  There are also separate files that have only names and fax numbers
of members for whom I have numbers, without all the other fields, to make
them easy to import into faxmodem software's phonebooks.

The files are available in ascii comma-delimited format, WordPerfect 5.1
secondary merge file format, and WordPerfect Office Notebook format.  The
fax-only files are only available in ascii comma-delimited format.

The fax numbers are more complete than those in Grace York's list at
U.Mich.  I have emailed my list to her so she can update hers.

The ftp site is:  ftp://ftp.shell.portal.com/pub/chan/federal/104

West Virginia Apparently Offers *Modern* Copies of Its Public Records

Thu, 26 Jan 1995 22:12:41 -0500
>From Wayne Lorentz <WCHSNews@AOL.COM> via Peter Sussman <pys@well.sf.ca.us>
To: Multiple recipients of list FOI-L <FOI-L@suvm.acs.syr.EDU>
    [This is a Freedom-of-Information listserv. --jim]

A surprising Diamond in the search for information is the state of West
Virginia. According to the FOI law, if the information you are looking for
is in a form other than paper copy, it must be provided to you in that
form, if you request.
To quote (Hey, I'm a journalist - it's more than a habit - it's a nervous tick)

SS29B-1-3-3
"...if the records requested exist in magnetic, electronic, or computer
form, the custodian of the records shall make such copies available on
magnetic or electronic media, if so requested."

That quote is from an earlier version (I keep the most recent one at work).
The current rendition has been expanded from magnetic media to films,
slides, overheads, etc... Very nice, indeed, especially after the horror
stories I've heard in other states.

As an example, I was doing a project on fraud. So I started with a list of
all the not-for-profit groups registered in the state. To print it out
would have been over one hundred pages. However, since the list is stored
in a Paradox database on their IBM computers, I was able to get a copy of
the file on a computer disk. I used the Quattro Pro spreadsheet to look at
and manipulate the data (since I don't have a database program).

Very helpful, and saved me money over the "reasonable cost" of duplication
(they only charged $5 for the whole thing.)        [ <===!!!  WOW!  --jim]

New York State Government Documents Online Library, Apparently Fee-Free

>From john.perz@hvbbs.com (John Perz)
Date: Fri, 27 Jan 1995 01:35:54 GMT

The Legislative Gazette is a weekly newspaper covering the New York State
Government put out by journalism & political science majors at State
University of New York at Albany.

In the January 23 issue, in a special section on the New York State
Library, the following appeared:

" . . . NYSDOC is a mailing list for New York State government documents
and information issues. To subscribe, send a message to
listproc@unix2.nysed.gov with message "subscribe NYSDOC firstname
lastname". To post messages, send to nysdoc@unix2.nysed.gov The contact
person for the list is David Gosda, New York State Library,
david@unix2.nysed.gov (518-473-6297)."

"As a viable and necessary component of external information management,
the State Library in cooperation with the State Archives and Records
Administration is developing a prototype government Information Locator
System (ILS). The ILS provides descriptive histories and organizational
information about all 75 state agencies. It is accessible over the Internet
(unix2.nysed.gov) and includes connections to executive, legislative, and
judicial information servers (gophers) as well as government information
sources such as the New York State OGS Contract Database and the Rural
Assistance Information Network."

"Joseph F.Shubert, state librarian and assistant commissioner for
libraries, explained that "the New York State Library is ready to receive
New York State publications in electronic format and make them available
via the Internet, under the provision of chapter 331 of the Laws of 1994."
This summer, legislation was signed requiring state agencies to forward a
machine-readable copy of all public documents recorded in electronic or
machine-readable format to the New York State Library."

Eating the Internal Revenue Code - A RoboGopher Progress Report

Fri, 27 Jan 95 18:25:13 +0100
>From <a *very* reliable friend>

[In the last exciting episode, our hero was about to hack <not crack!> his
Gopher source-code so it would *automatically* retrieve several thousand
separate files that compose the Codes of interest.]

My newly-born RoboGopher is now happily lapping up the 1994 Internal
Revenue Code from the House Gopher server (hamilton1.house.gov), which has
the *entire* U.S. Code on-line. Since the Internal Revenue code comprises
just two of the 50 titles of the USC, and it's 22 megabytes, the mind
boggles at how big the whole thing must be (though I suspect the IRC is
more complicated than most).

[I had commented, earlier, re such Gopher automation:]
>>I'm surprised that it's not already>been done and splattered all over the
>>net.

I'm virtually certain something so obvious has been done dozens of times,
but a check of the FAQs and a scan of the Gopher newsgroup turned up
nothing other than one plaintive request for precisely what I was hoping to
find--and no replies.

What I've got is currently heroically ugly--the name of the directory where
it puts the retrieved files is compiled into the program--but it required
less than 50 lines of changes to the gopher client program to add recursive
retrieval. You just navigate to the root of the material you want to
retrieve and press "z". It walks through an arbitrarily deep hierarchy in
order, saving each item to a file name consisting of a zero-filled number
that increments from 1 to the number of files saved, followed by the item
title converted into a Unix file name as Gopher currently does. It sleeps
for 30 seconds between documents to avoid getting a reputation as a
net.hog.

If you run across somebody with a need for something like this (who doesn't
mind rebuilding such programs from the source), let me know and I'll clean
it up and send it their way.

[UNIX HACKERS:  I think this would be almost-exactly the tool needed to
auto-fetch the thousands of separate files that compose the California
Legislature's public archives of legislation, statutes and the
constitution.  Da?  And, after the first humonguous sucking sound, probably
this RoboRooter - used to dislodge what RotoRooters are usually used for -
could be trivially-modified so as to fetch only those files that have been
modified after a certain date.]

After I finish updating the tax code, I'll probably also do the Patents,
Copyrights, and Nationality titles if I can summon the courage to wade
through more ugly ASCII.

"Let us contemplate our forefathers, and posterity, and resolve to maintain
the rights bequeathed to us from the former, for the sake of the latter.
...  Let us remember that 'if we suffer tamely a lawless attack upon our
liberty, we encourage it, and involve others in our doom.'  It is a very
serious consideration that millions yet unborn may be the miserable sharers
of the event."
- Samuel Adams ("patriot, statesman, brewer"), speech, 1771
