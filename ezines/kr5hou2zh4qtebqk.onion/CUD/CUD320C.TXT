Bay Area Document Archives Available for Anonymous UUCP Download
~~~ ~~~~ ~~~~~~~~ ~~~~~~~~ ~~~~~~~~~ ~~~ ~~~~~~~~~ ~~~~ ~~~~~~~~

	The solarsys site (SYSOP: Chas. Dye) has CuD archives and other
documents available for anonymous uucp download.  All materials may be
downloaded for the cost of your phone call to Oakland, California.

To access this site from your unix box set up with uucp, follow these
steps:

	1.  Put a line in your /usr/lib/uucp/Systems ( or L.Sys) file
	    like this:
	solarsys Any ACU 9600 14153396540 ogin: archinfo sword: knockknock

	2.  From your OS prompt, type your uucp request:
		$ uucp solarsys~/ls-lR.Z /tmp/ls-lR.Z

If you need more detailed information about how to configure uucp, try
the Nutshell book "Managing uucp and Usenet"

We are using a Telebit T2500 modem, which supports speeds up to 9600
baud, plus PEP (which is auto-detected if you dial in with a Telebit).
If you're having trouble with the chat script, try adding a couple of
breaks.  You can also send mail to the Sysop:

	chas@solution.com     or     chas@solarsys.solution.com

You can also login interactively using the username/password of
guest/telebit This service is available every night between the hours
of 11:00pm and 8:00am PDT

The file ls-lR.Z is a listing of all files currently archived; the
listing updated daily.  All files are compressed using the unix
compress utility; if you don't have it, you can download compress.tar
	( $ uucp solarsys~/compress.tar /tmp/compress.tar )
