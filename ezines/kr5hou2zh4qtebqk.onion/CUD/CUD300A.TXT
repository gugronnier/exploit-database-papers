***  CuD #3.00: File 1 of 6: Moderator's corner                  ***
********************************************************************

From: Moderators
Subject: Moderators' Corner
Date: January 6, 1991

In this file:
1. VOLUME 3 BEGINS WITH THIS ISSUE
2. SEXISM AND CuD
++++++++++

+++++++++++
Volume 3 Starts Here
+++++++++++

Volume 1, with issues #1.00 thru 1.29 and Volume 2, issues 2.00 thru 2.19,
complete the first year of CuD. With the new year we start a new volume,
and it will remain Volume #3 thru 1991.  We'll spare readers self-indulgent
reflections on the first year, but we're amazed that what began as a
temporary outlet with Pat Townson's support and help back in March seems to
have become at least semi-permanent. Following Craig Neidorf's victory, we
thought there would be little else to write about, but the articles,
comments, and responses keep coming, so we'll keep publishing as long as
they do. The ftp sites have expanded and contain a variety of papers and
documents related to the CU. We *STRONGLY ENCOURAGE* researchers, attorneys
and law students to send quality papers over to us for the archives. We
also thank all those who send in news blurbs--keep them coming.

CuD and Sexism
++++++++++++

In a file below, the writer takes the moderators to task for not taking a
stand on sexist language. We agree that writing should be as gender free as
possible, but we don't change articles (except for formatting, spelling,
and deleting long sigs).  Authors have their own style, and while we object
to sexist language (or any other action that reinforces the cultural power
of one group over another), we cannot edit it out. An author's style is a
valid index of cultural influences, and therefore it remains an open
archive to be decoded as window into the world of, in this case, the CU. We
*STRONGLY* encourage articles on the isms (ageism, sexism, racism) and the
CU.
