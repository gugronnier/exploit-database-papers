Subject: File 1--A Seduction In Cyberspace?

     On May 18th, Daniel Montgomery left Seattle for an as yet unknown
location. His departure has caused, in its wake, a frenzy of media
coverage. And that magic word -- "INTERNET" -- is attached to this
story.

     Daniel Montgomery is 15 years-old and potentially gay. Until May
of this year, he was what Tahoma High School Assistant Principal Rob
Morrow would call a "nice young man." More than being a "nice young
man," Daniel Montgomery was a teenager exploring cyberspace via
America Online. Through a chat room on America Online, Daniel met
someone calling himself "Damien Starr." Eventually, Starr may have
enticed Daniel to leave his Maple Valley home.

      According to a published report in the 6-2-95 edition of the
Seattle Post Intelligencer, Starr's user profile on America Online
indicates Starr is 18 years-old, gay, and resides somewhere on Nob
Hill in San Fransisco. Starr and Daniel Montgomery apparently
communicated, for a period of time, on America Online and by way of a
password-protected 1-800 phone number. According to the Seattle Post
Intelligencer and Bill Montgomery -- Daniel's father -- Starr had
suggested that, if Daniel was discovering he is gay, and revealed such
to his parents, they probably would kick him out of his home. Bill
Montgomery believes this may have played a role in why Daniel
Montgomery left -- ostensibly because Daniel had not discussed his
sexual orientation with his parents, and Daniel's mother had stated
negative feelings about gays in the past. Thus, Bill Montgomery
asserts Daniel may have been particularly open to another suggestion --
that Daniel come join Starr.

       When Daniel left, he apparently did so after receiving a bus
ticket in the mail from Starr. Since then, Daniel has sent 2 E-Mail
messages to his father stating that he's doing OK while making more
money than his parents, according to reports from several broadcast
news organizations here in Seattle. Bill Montgomery doesn't KNOW if
this is true but states that, if what Daniel had claimed is true, at
least part of it is temporary. Soundbites aired on TV news (KOMO-TV
and KING-TV - 6-2-95) illustrate Bill Montgomery suspects his son is
being groomed for sex. According to the Seattle Post Intelligencer,
that assessment may, in part, be drawn from Daniel's sister. She lives
in Southern California and has informed Bill Montgomery of reports
she's seen on TV about groups that seduce young gay males by offering
protection from parents who might not be supportive of a homosexual
orientation in their children. The Seattle Post Intelligencer
summarizes Montgomery's description of the "group's" method of
operation as enticement to run away followed by provision of food and
money for a short time, and then culminating in requests for sexual
favors in return. The Seattle Post Intelligencer, and broadcast news
organizations in Seattle, are not, however, reporting confirmation of
this notion.

       Starr has contacted the Montgomery family four times, again,
according to the Seattle Post Intelligencer, to assure them Daniel is
not in any danger. As stated previously, Montgomery doesn't doubt this
for the time being. But, Montgomery also told the Seattle Post
Intelligencer that Starr is probably a recruiter who might have been
recruited into the "group" not so long ago.

       Bill Montgomery is not saying whether he will ask America
Online to provide Starr's real name and/or other information on Starr
retained by America Online. The Seattle Post Intelligencer, though,
reports that the FBI won't deny they are interested in asking America
Online to reveal information on Starr. And "sources" are stated by the
Seattle Post Intelligencer as indicating that the FBI continues to
investigate the case.

        There are several interesting factors in this turn of events.
Some of those factors can be appreciated more easily by people who
live in Washington state and in the Puget Sound in particular.

          1. Washington state's Legislature just finished a regular
             session and special session -- back-to-back. Those sessions
             provided high political drama -- even for the online
             community. Until late last month, we were faced with a
             "harmful to minors" bill addressing, among other things,
             availability of sexual material to minors via online
             services. The bill easily passed the Legislature but was
             vetoed by Governor Lowry. A veto-override attempt did not
             fall so short that people here -- who were and are opposed
             to the legislation -- can breathe a sigh of relief; the
             issue WILL come back another day -- possibly quite soon.

          2. The Legislature also passed legislation which would
             change Washington state's laws dealing with run-aways.
             This legislation was partially vetoed. The result is a
             firestorm of resentment among a significant number of
             parents. They feel as though long-awaited relief has been
             stolen by a Governor who doesn't appreciate parenting
             issues in this state. For example: Laws existing through
             this Spring required that a child at the age of 13 could
             legally run away from home. Parents were powerless to do
             anything about such behavior unless the child was acting
             under the coercion of others in very strict
             circumstances. The new law is only slightly more
             restrictive on whether minors can run away -- certainly NOT
             restrictive enough to make Daniel Montgomery's act of
             running away an illegal act. Such laws, as those existing
             prior to the most recent regular session of the Washington
             state Legislature, have been in place for several years
             to provide abused children with the means to escape parental
             abuse if running away would accomplish that goal.

          3. A local TV station (KIRO) recently ran a series of
             reports called "Net Sex." Those reports were
             sensationally promoted with language that implied
             children can and do access sexually explicit sections of
             the INTERNET -- something which might be a threat to
             children if unsuspecting parents aren't watching what
             their kids are doing online. The actual reports, however,
             were reasonably balanced. But, the reports left Seattle
             sensitized to the existence of sexually explicit materials
             on the INTERNET.

          4. We have the copious and invalid use of the word
             "INTERNET" in broadcast reporting of the Montgomery
             run-away. We also have a case in which a 15-year-old
             ran away to circumstances the father of that 15-year-old
             asserts are probably sexual in nature. All four of the
             factors listed here may eventually come together as a
             dangerous brew is or will be created.

     In the current social and political climate, the Montgomery
run-away; the Baker case; the incidents where children download
instructions on how to make pipe bombs and then construct them; an
incident where a young girl seduces an adult male into a sexual
encounter after online meetings; incidents where online pedophiles do
there thing, and so much more seem to draw us headlong toward events
we may regret some years from now. I wonder if there is no other way
to see what is out there to be seen.

      Politicians revel in such events as those referred to above. I
believe it is no strange coincidence that Senator Exon's legislation
(Communications Decency Act) moved into the fast lane of Congressional
action at around the same time as news broke on the Baker case. It is
not novel for politicians to orchestrate their policies and agendas
around politically favorable current events. I expect more instances
of perceived or actual online abuse, and for politicians to take
advantage in the ways only politicians can.

      Whether it's Washington state, New York state, Alabama or
Washington, DC, I'm finding it more and more difficult to believe
there is any room left to assume reason will necessarily prevail over
emotion built to a fever-pitch. I see emotion more places than I
don't, and rancorous emotion at that. I also see associated and
ever-growing polarization. It actually frightens me because I think I
know what all that HIGH emotion will promulgate.

               ===========   UPDATE  ==================

     On Sunday [6-4-95] Seattle area teenager Daniel Montgomery -- who
had run away from home in mid-May at the possible coaxing of an AOL
subscriber -- met with his parents at a San Francisco airport.
According to various Seattle news media reports, Montgomery told his
parents, at that time, he was doing ok and had not been harmed.
Subsequently, reports from local media have exhibited an amazing
cacophony of inaccurate or incomplete information. For example: Even
on the day that Daniel Montgomery met with his parents, the Seattle
Post Intelligencer reported that Montgomery had been seen by a Seattle
Metro bus driver. According the the Seattle Post Intelligencer,
Montgomery had told the bus driver he was on his way out of town, and
Montgomery had shown the bus driver what the bus driver thought to be
a bus ticket to Florida.

      Once it was clear that Montgomery had met with his parents in
San Francisco, local news media issued conflicting stories as to
whether Montgomery would stay with his parents or grandparents. More
than one news organization implied a strained relationship between
Montgomery and his parents

      In the past two days, some news media organizations have stated
AOL was under some pressure to reveal information on a subscriber
using the alias "Damien Starr." However, other news media
organizations were stating that AOL was resolute in its policy not to
reveal information about subscribers. Even so, today, [6-6-95] several
broadcast organizations (KING-TV, KIRO-TV, KIRO radio, and KOMO radio)
now report that AOL has terminated the person who used the Damien
Starr alias. KOMO radio broadcast the following in a news program this
morning.

                    America Online says it's complying with a subpoena
                    and giving investigators information about the
                    account of Damien Starr. That's the name used by a
                    man suspected of luring a teenaged boy to San Francisco.
                    The computer service has also terminated the man's
                    account. The boy's now back with his family in
                    Maple Valley. [Maple Valley is a small community
                    in the Seattle area]

     KING-TV takes us a step further with a report that Damien Starr
is under investigation by the FBI for a possible violation of the Man
Act. KIRO-TV states that AOL terminated Damien Starr because Starr
allegedly solicited a minor in violation of AOL's policies.

      It's rather difficult to know what is truth, what is perception,
and what is true at one moment and not in the next moment, hour, or day in
this case. What seems certain, though, is that events pertaining to
the running away and/or seduction of Daniel Montgomery are not
finished.

Subject: File 2--Re: Protecting kids from porn on Web -- html enhancement

Source: comp-academic-freedom-talk@EFF.ORG

         Can the parents prevent their children from viewing
          --------------------------------------------------
                         unwanted Web pages?
                         -------------------

Yes. There is a simple solution.

The senate's Communication Decency Bill is ultimately harmful and
moreover it won't work because Internet does not know any country
boundaries. Nevertheless, the politicians are making impassioned
arguments that the children must be protected from the pornographic
materials and other unwanted materials (like how to make a bomb). Do
they have a valid point? Well, let me rephrase the question :

 If you have a simple way to prevent your kids from viewing some adult
materials or other unwanted stuff available on the Web, would you use
it to control their access? Particularly if that objective can be
accomplished without any censorship laws or any inconvenience? Also
free of cost too? I suppose most parents probably would.

Below the proposed solution is introduced in a question answer form.


Q1. Why is this fuss? I don't see any problem. Therefore no solution
    is necessary.

A. Actually, there is a problem. Do you want your 10-year old kid to
  read Hustler magazine? There are actually lots of adult materials on
  the Web (and there are going to be more in the future) which are even
  more unsuitable for young children. Concerned parents want to protect
  their kids from viewing such materials available on the Web. Also,
  adult page authors don't want any kids to view their stuff. Its apparent
  that the Internet is going to be so useful that kids should be
  encouraged to surf the Net.  Currently there is no good solution to
  this dilemma.

   If something is not done by the net-citizens themselves, the
  politicians can generate enough public support to curtail freedom of
  expression on the Net. Despite all the hype, only a small percentage
  of the general population are on the Net and thus netters are powerless
  to the law-makers majority of whom are not friends of the Net.


Q2.  Can anything be done?  How?

A. Yes. Concerned parents and educators can control access on Web. All
  it needs is a little cooperation from the Web browser designers (like
  people at Netscape and NCSA Mosaic) and also from the adult Web page
  authors.

  In the next version of the Web navigators, just introduce a new HTML
  tag <adult_only>. If a WWW browser encounters this tag enclosed inside
  the <head> </head> part of a HTML document, then the browser will
  simply refuse to load or render the document. The author of a Web page
  should put that tag in all of his pages containing materials that he
  does not want to be seen by young children.

  At the time of installing the browser, a password will be asked from
  the person (who is assumed to be an adult) installing the
  program. This password is for identification of the installer.  As a
  default, the <adult_only> checking is enabled.  To allow a parent (the
  adult installer) the freedom to view adult-only stuff, the browser can
  have a command line option "-unrestricted".  If that option is used,
  the program will ask for a password for identification (only at the
  beginning of the session).

  This way, a parent protects the kids from unwanted stuff on the
  Net. Also, the adult page authors are protected from unwanted
  attention from kids. It involves no cost, no laws or hassles.


Q3. What about gopher and FTP sites?

A.  This solution works for any HTML page which many come via HTTP,
  gopher or FTP protocols.  Besides, now the Web is the most popular
  part of the Net. However, external gif/jpeg files cannot be prevented
  because they are not in HTML. So, by this tag trick, all the unwanted stuff
  that is not in HTML cannot be barred.


Q4. Why would the purveyors of net pornography comply to use the
    <adult_only> HTML tag in their pages?

A. It seems that the people who are posting adult materials on their
  Web pages would like to prevent the young children from accessing the
  pages. That's why they build such lame "adult access shield" which
  asks "don't click here if you are under eighteen".  So, we can hope
  that an author of a Web page containing adult stuff will be glad to
  put this HTML tag at the beginning of the all Web pages containing
  adult materials. One can send an e-mail to remind the author in case such
  a page is not properly tagged.


Q5. Why should Netscape people or Mosaic people support the tag?

A. Because implementing the tag is very easy and all protective
  parents and educators would be glad to have the support for such a
  tag. Such a tag should become a part of the standard HTML.


Q6. But browsers are freely available and a kid can download his own
    copy of a browser himself. Also, a smart kid can hack something to get
    around the efforts of access control. What about that?

A. Yes, this could be a problem. But automated software techniques
  (using some operating system support) can be used to ensure that
  no secretly installed browser exists in the system.

  A determined smart kid cannot not prevented from accessing anything he
  wants. He can possibly write his own browser and other tools. Heck, he
  can buy his own PC, have his own Internet connection and set up a
  Web server with his own home page containing adult materials! So, let
  us be concerned about the no-so-determined kids.


Q7. Can't we use SurfWatch software or other such tools?

A. SurfWatch (http://www.surfwatch.com) is a newly announced tool that
  seem to allow the concerned parents to prepare a list of offending
  sites.  Any site in the list will be denied access to the browsers
  used by the children of the customer of SurfWatch.

  However there are serious problems.

   - Nobody can maintain an up-to-date and exhaustive list of
  sites. There are many obscure sites all over the world. New Web pages
  are appearing and disappearing dynamically everyday. You may block the
  Penthouse site, but your kid may possibly be viewing far more unwanted
  stuff from some obscure site in Netherlands if that site is not
  included in your list.

   - SurfWatch will maintain a list of unwanted sites for you (if you
   pay extra monthly fee). Then you will need to trust SurfWatch to
   decide what is good or bad for your kids.

   - You will have to pay for the blocking software as well as a
  optional list of sites maintained by SurfWatch company.

   - The browser will need to check a list of possibly thousand sites
  for every single Web access just to make sure it is not one of
  those. Won't it be slow?

   - A WWW site can host thousands of separate Web pages only a few of
  which probably contain adult materials and the rest are possibly
  harmless or useful. So blocking access to a site is not a good
  idea. If SurfWatch starts maintaining a list of offending Web pages,
  the list will be in very very long indeed. It is a hopeless idea to
  maintain a list of unwanted sites or unwanted URLs.


Q8. The tag seems to be a good idea. Can it be used for other
    purposes?

A.  This tag idea can be generalized to classify Web documents in
  variety of ways and it will greatly facilitate cataloging the Web
  documents. Web desperately needs such categorization so that your
  browser can select and reject Web materials of all sorts based on your
  priorities. This will cut down noise as well as litigation.

Subject: File 3--Illinois Legislater "Discovers" Net Porn (news excerpt)

Source: Chicago Tribune, May, 1995

Legislator cruises the internet and can't believe his eyes By Christi
Parsons

SPRINGFIELD--Sen. Walter Dudycz ((Ill. state legislator) has seen some
of the weirdest, kinkiest stuff of his life in the few short weeks he
has had access to the worldwide computer network known as the
Internet.

Child pornography. Sex talk. Serious come-ons and propositions. "You
wouldn't believe some of this stuff," said Dudycz (R-Chicago). "Every
time I sit down at the computer I've got some pornographic picture
waiting for me."

In only a few weeks, Dudycz has seen how ugly things can get on the
Internet.  So this spring, is sponsoring a bill in the General
Assembly to forbid adults from soliciting minors for sex on the
Internet. The Senate already has approved the measure, and it awaits
consideration in the House.

Dudycz says it's the first of many bills to come, as he continues to
prowl the Internet and discover the societal perils he's sure it
harbors.

    ((Observation that child pornography is already illegal and that
    the Internet's newness leaves some grey areas.  The article notes
    that Georgia and Florida have passed laws targetting the
    Internet, and Illinois and California are considering similar
    laws)).

     ((The article notes that policing the Internet and policing the
     corner store are similar in that anybody can file a complaint. It
     summarizes how on-line services can find people who are
     responsible for supplying "obscene" material.  It notes that
     civil libertarians argue against restrictive legislation such as
     the Exon Bill pending on Congress)).

"This has everything to do with the novelty of the Internet to the
bill writers," Godwin said.

"We're in a generation between people who never had this technology
and people who grew up with it," Godwin said. "In this transition
period, they're not comfortable. So their impulse is to regulate."

     ((The article notes that Dudycz is new on the nets, and--as a
     detective in the Chicago Police Department, he decided to go
     "undercover" to see "how intimate" people wanted to get)).

He filled out his computer profile to say he is a 15-year-old girl
from Chicago and set up a screen name.  Dudcyz doesn't want to
disclose the name he uses, but it is similar to "Bashful."

Dudcyz said "Bashful" is routinely propositioned as "she" moves from
chat room to chat room and talks with other users via e-mail and
instant messaging systems. Dudcyz gets a lot of pornography, and one
person has invited "Bashful" to pose nude for him.

One recent night, as other senators were heading home from a week of
session, Dudycz stayed after hours in the empty Senate offices and
became "Bashful."

When he signed on, there already were three pornographic photographs
sent to him by other users. Two were garden-variety porn, and he
tossed them out. The third was an amateurish photograph of an
obviously underage girl in a state of semi-dress. Dudycz stored the
screen name of its user to follow up on it later.

     ((The article describe a "chat room" encounter with a 39 year old
     engineer who, believing Dudycz was a 15 year old female,
     suggested a sexual liason)).

So far, Dudycz hasn't busted anybody for solicitation. But he has
compiled a list of screen names and is corresponding with several in
anticipation of a sting operation by Chicago police.

As for his bill, Dudycz said, he hopes it will at least alert parents
to what's going on on the Internet.

     ((The article concludes with a warning by Dudycz to parents
     suggesting that when they think their kids are doing homework on
     the computer, maybe they're not)).

Recommendations of the
Prevention of Crime in Industry Committee
of the Canadian Association of Chiefs of Police

October 20, 1994
Ottawa, Ontario
- - - - - - - -

On October 20, 1994, the CACP Prevention of Crime in Industry Committee
met with members of the private sector, governmental agencies, and
various police agencies from across Canada.  The purpose of the meeting
was to discuss technological crime issues and their impact on crime
prevention, law enforcement, and community based policing initiatives.
The following recommendations were adopted at the meeting and are to be
forwarded to the board of the Canadian Association of Chiefs of Police.


Recommendation 1:

Given the inter-provincial and international nature of computer and
telecommunications crime, the Federal Government, in consultation with
the provinces and other interested parties, should enact a federal
statute to legislate against these crimes.  Current provisions in the
Criminal Code relating to technological crime, should remain intact
and can be used for locally based computer and telecommunications crimes.


Recommendation 2:

The Federal Government should ensure that information highway services
provide security and privacy features both for base service and to
protect sensitive communications.  Future legislative initiatives and
policy statements should *not* provide the general public with the false
expectation that basic services of the information highway will provide
high degrees of privacy.  In fact, the government should educate the
public as to the "open" nature of many forms of communications technologies.
The Prevention of Crime in industry Committee should encourage and
participate ion the education of corporate management on the risks/
vulnerabilities of computer environments and remedial options available.


Recommendation 3:

The Criminal Code should be amended to include the following provisions:

        a) the unauthorized possession, use, sale, publication, or
           distribution of access codes, computer hacking programs/tools,
           and telecommunications access codes should be an offense.

        b) Sections 342.1 Criminal Code (Unauthorized computer access),
           430(1.1) Criminal Code (Mischief to data), and Section 326
           Criminal Code (Theft of telecommunications) should be listed
           in Section 183 of the Criminal Code as offenses where wiretap
           authorization may be obtained.

        c) Use of computer networks and the national telecommunications
           system in the furtherance of criminal activities such as the
           distribution of pornography, distribution of hate literature,
           or harassment of individuals should be an offense in itself,
           either in the Criminal Code or a Federal Statute.


Recommendation 4:

The Federal Government should closely examine the problem of computer
data encryption as it relates to investigative duties of law enforcement
and enact legislation to facilitate decryption of this data by compelling
involved persons or corporations to assist police.  This legislation
should also prevent the disclosure of sensitive investigative techniques
used by police or sensitive proprietary information of a private corporation
that was compelled to assist police.


Recommendation 5:

The Federal Government, in conjunction with the provinces, should
support educational initiatives to encourage sound computer ethics
and computer responsibility in the youth of Canada.  Computer crime
prevention initiatives should be supported as part of a community
based policing approach.


Recommendation 6:

The Federal Government in conjunction with the RCMP should explore the
possibility of constructing a core competency group consisting of law
enforcement and technical industry personnel to act:

        a) as a lead resource in problem identification and resolution, and

        b) as a lead investigative unit for complex computer and
           telecommunications crime investigations.


Recommendation 7:

The Federal Government should undertake discussions with the United States
Government to make the searching of computer banks in the United States
by Canadian officials in Canada legally possible though an international
protocol or convention.  Agreements of this nature with other countries
can be explored at a later date.

From--Jonah Seiger <jseiger@cdt.org>
Subject--Christian Coalition Pledges to Restrict Access to Porno on the Net

On Thursday 5/17, the Christian Coalition unveiled their "Contract with the
American Family" yesterday (5/17). A number of prominant republicans --
including Newt Gingrich & Phil Gramm, have pledged to work to pass the CC's
contract. And don't forget either that the repub presidential candidates
are very interested in appealing to the CC.

One of the items in the "Contract" seeks to restrict childrens access to
pornography on the Internet.

All this spells more bad news for us -- and gives one more reason why we
need to get behind Leahy.

>From the Contract with the American Family (pages 27 & 28)


Restricting Pornography

Protecting children from exposure to pornography on the Internet and cable
television, and from the sexual exploitation of child pornographers.

1. Enactment of legislation to protect children from being exposed to
   pornography on the Internet

PORNOGRAPHY, BOTH SOFT CORE and hard core, is freely available on the
Internet to virtually anyone with a home computer. Several magazines post
pornographic images that can be viewed by anyone, including children, for
free. There are also numerous sites on the Internet where hard core
pornography depicting a variety of explicit acts, even rape scenes and
bestiality, are available free and can be accessed with a few clicks of a
computer button.

Christian Coalition urges Congress to enact legislation to protect children
from being exposed to pornography on the Internet. Criminal law should be
amended to prohibit distribution of, or making available, any pornography,,
soft core or hard, to children, and to prohibit distribution of obscene
hard core pornography to adults.

2. Enactment of legislation to require cable television companies to completely
   block the video and audio on pornography channels to non-subscribers.

Many children throughout the country are exposed to pornography, often hard
core, on cable television because of incomplete scrambling of the signal on
pornography channels. Cable companies have asserted that it is the parents'
responsibility to guard their children. Christian Coalition believes that
the responsibility should be on the cable companies to help parents keep
pornography out of their homes. Cable companies should not be allowed to
transmit pornography to non-subscribers. We urge Congress to require cable
television companies to completely block the video and audio on pornography
channels to non-subscribers.

3. Amending the federal child pornography law to make illegal the possession of
   any child pornography

Sexual exploitation of children though child pornography continues to be a
major problem in society. Possession of child pornography should be a
crime. President Reagan proposed such a law in 1988, hoping that those with
collections of child pornography would destroy them for fear of federal
prosecution.  In an 11th hour compromise on the bill, however, a conference
committee of House and Senate members changed the Reagan bill to
criminalize only the possession of "three or more" items of child
pornography, videos, magazines, etc. Thus, federal low sanctions the
possession of some child pornography -- less than three pieces. A person
with two hour-long videotapes depicting the rape of a child cannot be
charged with a federal crime, yet a person with three photos depicting a
child in a lascivious pose can. Christian Coalition urges that the federal
child pornography law should be amended to make illegal possession of any
child pornography.
