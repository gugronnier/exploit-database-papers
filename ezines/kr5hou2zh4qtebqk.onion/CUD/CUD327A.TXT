Regarding Craig Neidorf's article 'The TERMINUS of Len Rose' and his
follow-up backing down on his position on the prosecutors involved:

This sounds amazingly like law enforcement personnel have put the
screws to him.  Yes, it is true, people like William Cook and Tim
Foley are ordinary people like you and me, with hobbies and families
and all that nonsense.  As anyone who stops and thinks for a moment
will realize, that also means they are subject to the same human
foibles of pride, self-doubt, need for recognition and so forth.

It's been my experience that most trial lawyers and law enforcement
officers are cocky, arrogant people with a great need for recognition
and success, and the need to win, to beat the opposition.  They're
often hard-headed and stubborn.  Now, other than what I've read about
these two law enforcement men, I don't know them.  But Craig's remarks
"Illinois State Police and SSA Tim Foley (what is HE doing here!?)
came to Len's new home..." and "Assistant U.S.  Attorney William Cook
in Chicago wanted a piece of the action, in part perhaps to redeem
himself from his highly publicized defeat in U.S. v. Neidorf..." are
particularly telling.

Those remarks are particularly reflective of men who need to make a
name for themselves to feel good.  It all fits very well.  That
doesn't mean they are not in the profession because "They believe in
their work like a sacred religious mission", but that perhaps they let
their personal wants and needs get in the way of objective vision,
just like the rest of humanity.

I'm sorry, but I just don't buy "that the prosecutors and law
enforcement officials in our system overall are dedicated to doing the
right thing and going after offenders that they truly believe to be
committing real crimes." Some are, no doubt, doing just that.  Some
make honest mistakes, too.  But I think there are far more bad apples
than Craig is willing to admit publicly.  Law enforcement does not
gain a universal, wide reputation as being corrupt, or abusive, or
ineffectual, or whatever bad image they might hold because there is a
very few bad apples.  Does anyone here really believe the LA cops who
beat the motorist on video tape were dedicated to doing the right
thing?

I think Mr. Foley and Mr. Cook let their egos get in the way,
big-time.
