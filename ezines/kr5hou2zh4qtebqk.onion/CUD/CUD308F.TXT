 - Washington, D.C.                         SPA STRIKES AGAIN!
   ---------------

 Last  week the Software Publishers Association (SPA) reported a  settle-
 ment  with  Davy McKee Corp.  concerning illegal use  of  software  (CPU
 Status Report #10), this week the SPA has announced a raid on Parametrix
 Corp.,  an  engineering consulting firm,  that "unveiled  a  substantial
 number of illegal copies of software in use."

 After  obtaining an exparte writ of seizure and a temporary  restraining
 order,  on  February 26,  the SPA's attorneys,  along with some  federal
 marshals  paid a surprise visit to the Bellevue and Sumner locations  of
 Parametrix  and  conducted an audit of the personal computers  at  these
 locations.

 SPA Executive Director Ken Wasch said,  "The raid on Parametrix is  part
 of  the  industry's  stepped-up  campaign  against  software  piracy  in
 corporate America.   The SPA now receives dozens of piracy reports  each
 week, and we are filing new lawsuits every few days."

 [Moderators' note:  Those of us heavily into the matrix tend to forget
 that most "real people" aren't using the same tools to obtain
 information, etc.  Here are some interesting numbers that may help to
 understand the next time the general public fails to get too excited
 about encroachments on our electronic freedoms.]
