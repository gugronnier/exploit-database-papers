Subject: File 8--Complain to Journalists

The national convention of The Society of Professional Journalists,
an organization of roughly 18,000 members in the United States, Canada
and Japan, is meeting Oct. 17-19 in Cleveland.  As part of that convention,
a seminar will be conducted on writing about computers and computer networks.

Since over the years, cyberspace travelers have bemoaned the accuracy of
articles relating to computers, computer networks and even telephones,
we ask that you email or snail mail examples of articles that you have
found solid and others that you have found less so.  Please include a note
of explanation.

The panel then will try to compile the examples, and the comments
and produce a handout for discussion.  Sometime in the week after the
convention, we will post the results of the session.  The names of the
panelists will be disclosed at that time since it is possible that some of the
articles that may be submitted may have been written by a panelist.

Mail paper examples to me at the address below.  Where possible, the
examples should include a copy of the article, the name of the publication
and _specific_ comments.  If the article is dismissed simply as "nonsense,"
state that it is because paragraph 5 has failed to adequately explain a
concept, and that it would have been better to have said it this way or
that.

So, if you go into fits when you see the word "hacker" in print, please
mail by Sept. 30.

Thank you for your cooperation.
