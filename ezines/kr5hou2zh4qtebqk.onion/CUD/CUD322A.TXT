Three LoD members form Comsec Data Security
+++++++++++++++++

Craig Neidorf sent over the following article announcing the formation
of a security company by three former members of the Legion of Doom.
The new company was not a sudden inspiration, but the result of
considerable research and groundwork prior to the announcement.
According to the partners, the Texas-based companies has already
landed several significant contracts.  When asked why anybody should
hire ex-hackers, one commentator responded that security, like
hacking, is just another form of puzzle-solving, and those who can
find the holes are likely to those most-able to close them.

AFTER YOU'VE BEAT 'EM -- JOIN 'EM

After infiltrating some of America's most sensitive computer banks,
is there any challenge left for a digital desperado?  Only to go legit,
say three former members of the notorious hacker group, the LEGION OF
DOOM, who have quit the outlaw game to start Comsec Data Security.  The
Legionnaries claimed an 80% success rate in penetrating computer
networks, and now they want to teach private industry to protect itself
>from the next generation of intruders.  "You can't put a price tag on the
information we know," says Scott Chasin, a Comsec partner.  But they'll
try.

(This article features a color photo of the three founding members:
 Erik Bloodaxe, Doc Holiday, and Malefactor.)
