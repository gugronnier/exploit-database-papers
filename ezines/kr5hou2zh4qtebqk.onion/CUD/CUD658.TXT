Guys who impersonate females on the net are called 'she-males'.  There
are *lots* of them around...

What many of these macho hetboys out there don't realise is that there's
a large gay and bi subculture that gets off on hanging out on the net,
irc, and bbs's, using female handles in order to hit on het guys like
this.

There's a great deal of satisfaction to be had from having hot netsex
with one of these bozos, then while he's relaxing and wiping the cum
off his keyboard you tell him 'Yo, that was fun.  Say, next time,
call me Danny...'

That's one reason guys pretend to be females; another group talks to
women to get them to talk dirty, thinking they're talking to other
women, especially on the lesbian and bisexual female channels on IRC.
(The lesbian channels are hilarious, where the women ask you questions
that the men 'couldn't possibly' know the answers to, like the small
print on a packet of tampons.  Also you have to string off a list
of very right-on lesbian-friendly music that you're supposed to like...
They seem to think this will keep the she-males out.  Bwahahaha!)

I remember one time on #bifem last year when there were 5 people on
the channel and *every one* of us was either male or m->f transsexual...
not a real woman among us!  (I'm not sure the other 4 guys realised
this...)

Watch out guys, the next woman you molest might be a 6'2'' programmer
from Silverado California!

You don't leave much to comment on, but I'm curious what your
reasoning is for your position. I agree with you on the second to
last paragraph, that policies and programs that are, or could be,
destructive should be opposed, but I don't understand the connection
between the ideal that every citizen that cares to connect up and
start surfing the net should be allowed to and a policy that's
destructive to either the "cyberspace" that we keep hearing about or
the real society in which we live.

Maybe I'm misunderstanding your position, but you seem to favour a
"status quo" position that only the technologically knowledgable
should be allowed to use the networks. A sort of nerd-priesthood, if
you will, paying homage to the net.gods. If this is, in fact, your
position, how would one go about joining this priesthood? What sort
of controls will have to be implemented to keep out the
non-initiated?

STATUS OF THE BILL (updated 6/28/94)

The Cantwell bill, that allows for fewer restrictions exports of
cryptography, has an interesting history.  It was rolled into the
General Export Administration Act HR 3937.  The House Foreign Affairs
Committee passed the full strength version out of committee after
open, public hearings.  The House Intelligence Committee took the
bill and gutted it after a day of closed, secret hearings.  The
gutted version is making its way to the House floor.

There is a crucial stop-off point, however.  The House Rules Committee
will hold a hearing on Thursday June 30th, 10:30am in D.C. (Room H-13)
to determine if the bill can be amended on the House floor (an "open"
bill) or not (a "closed" bill).

If they mark the bill as "open", then the Cantwell bill could be restored
to its previous version, removing the language put in by the House Select
Intelligence Committee which gutted it without a public hearing.

It is crucial that you call of the members of the House Rules Committee
before 10:30am Thursday June 30th and urge them to mark the bill as
"open".

This may be the last thing you can do for the cryptographic export
legislation.  Take the time to make a call!

Chronology of the bill
Jun 30, 94  House Rules Comm. decides whether to allow amendments
    on the bill when it reaches the House floor
Jun 14, 94  Gutted by the House Select Committee on Intelligence
May 20, 94  Referred to the House Select Committee on Intelligence
May 18, 94  Passed out of the House Foreign Affairs Committee on May 18
    attached to HR 3937, the General Export Administration Act
Dec  6, 93  Referred to the Subcommittee on Economic Policy, Trade and
Nov 22, 93  Referred to the House Committee on Foreign Affairs.

 ---------------------------------------------------------------
WHAT YOU CAN DO RIGHT NOW

Estimated time to do this good deed: Two minutes

Show your support for HR 3937 (formerly HR 3627) by contacting a member
of the House Rules Committee and ask them to mark the bill as "open"
(allowing amendments) when it reaches the House floor.

The phone numbers of the members of the House Rules Committee are listed
below.  Please pick one from your state and call them.  If your state
isn't listed please call the Chairman, Rep. Joe Moakley.

Feel free to use the following sample communique:

The Honorable ____________
address
Washington DC, 20515

Dear Congressman or Congresswoman,

Please mark the General Export Administration Act (HR 3937) as
"open" (allowing amendments on the House floor).

Recently the House Intelligence Committee removed several provisions
of the General Export Administration Act, HR 3937, dealing with
the export of cryptographic technology.

The House Intelligence Committee did this in a closed, secret hearing
which provided for no public input.  The House Foreign Affairs
Committee previously held an open hearing on the same issue and
received a flood of people testifying in favor of the bill, which the
committee then reported out in full.

I urge you to allow the democratic process to take its course
on the House floor and mark the bill as "open".

Sincerely,

 --------------------------------------------------------------
What is the Cantwell bill?

The Cantwell bill would permit companies to export products with
encryption technology in them.  US companies are currently
not permitted to export products (hardware or software) with this
technology in them.


What is encryption technology?

Encryption technology, or cryptography, is the art of scrambling
a conversation so that only the people communicating can decode
it.  Other people (such as eavesdroppers) cannot learn about
the conversation.


Where is cryptography being used?

Cryptography is used to encrypt electronic mail to protect its confidentiality
in transit.  It's used by bank automatic teller machines to protect
sensitive data (such as your account number, your Personal Identification
Number, and your bank balance).  It can be implemented into software
(such as electronic mail programs and word processors) as well as hardware
(such as telephones and "walkie-talkies") to ensure your privacy.


Why is there a restriction on exporting products with technology
in them?

For many years the United States was a leading researcher in
cryptography.  High quality cryptographic technology was available only
within the United States.  The US government thought that if they did
not let this technology be exported, foreign individuals would not be able
to obtain it and use it against us (by keeping US intelligence agencies
from eavesdropping on their communications)

Since then, cryptography research has been published in international
journals.  Companies have been created throughout the world who
export cryptographic technology from countries that do not have
these restrictions.  You can now buy the same, high-quality cryptographic
technology from many international firms.  Although the marketplace
has changed, the regulations have not.


Why should the regulations be changed?

US companies compete in a global marketplace.  Because of the export
regulations, they often compete alongside products with superior
cryptographic capabilities built into them.

The result is that US companies build their products with
an inferior encryption technology.  The result of this is that
you, as an American consumer, have great difficulty obtaining
products with strong encryption in them.

Because US products cannot compete against products with better
privacy features, and because the laws are outdated, the regulations
should be changed.  The Cantwell bill fixes these regulations to more
accurately resemble the current situation of the world marketplace.


How can I help encourage more privacy-enhanced products and
pass the Cantwell bill?

Call or write your representative and ask them to support or cosponsor
Rep. Cantwell's export provisions (formerly HR 3627) in the General
Export Administration Act, HR 3937.  You can base your letter on the
sample communication below.


SAMPLE LETTER OR PHONE CALL

The Honorable ____________
address
Washington DC, 20515

Dear Congressman or Congresswoman,

As a citizen concerned for my privacy, as well as a supporter of
American business, I urge you to cosponsor the Rep. Cantwell's
cryptographic export provisions (formerly HR 3627) in the General
Export Administration Act, HR 3937.

The bill would allow US companies to produce and export products with
cryptographic privacy-enhancing technology in them.  These products
are already available from firms throughout the world.  US companies
lose nearly $100 million per year in exports to them.

By encouraging this industry, ordinary citizens like you and me would
be able to purchase products with better privacy features.

Please support or co-sponsor HR 3937.

Sincerely,

                 ___________________________________

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

   PALO ALTO, Calif., June 13, 1994 -- RSA Data Security Inc. (RSA) and
   Enterprise Integration Technologies Corp. (EIT) today announced the
   formation of Terisa Systems, a joint venture that will market, license
   and support technologies that make secure Internet transactions
   possible. The new company will provide toolkits and support to
   developers of Internet applications for the World Wide Web (WWW) and
   NCSA Mosaic.

   RSA is the world leader in commercial cryptography and principal
   source of public key cryptosystems; EIT is a leading developer of
   software supporting commercial use of the Internet. Terisa Systems
   will combine the strengths of both companies to provide developers of
   Internet applications with a complete, consistent, and well-supported
   solution to their security needs.

   Initial toolkits from Terisa Systems will support the development of
   secure WWW clients and servers. The World Wide Web is a popular
   Internet application architecture that enables easy access to
   multimedia information distributed across the thousands of computers
   that comprise the Internet. However, use of the WWW in commerce
   requires features such as authentication, authorization, encryption
   and payment that are currently not well supported.

   Terisa Systems will provide an integrated solution to all of these
   needs based on RSA's public key cryptography and EIT's Secure-HTTP
   (HyperText Transfer Protocol), an enhanced version of the World Wide
   Web's internal communications language. Secure-HTTP ensures the
   authenticity of transactions and the confidentiality of information
   exchanged via HTTP. With a Secure-HTTP enabled application, a user can
   affix digital signatures that cannot be repudiated, permitting digital
   contracts that are legally binding and auditable. In addition,
   sensitive information such as credit card numbers and bid amounts can
   be encrypted and securely exchanged.

   Secure-HTTP can incorporate a variety of cryptographic standards and
   support interoperation between programs using different cryptographic
   algorithms. This is particularly useful for interaction between
   domestic and foreign users, where foreign users may not have access to
   the same algorithms as domestic users.

   Allan M. Schiffman, chief technical officer of EIT, said, "We've had
   tremendous interest on the part of developers in Secure-HTTP, but
   haven't been able to address their needs for a fully integrated
   package. Terisa Systems will provide 'one-stop shopping' for
   developers and give them the technology and support they need to get
   their applications to the market quickly."

   According to John Young, chairman of Smart Valley Inc., "The Internet
   has been evolving quickly as a medium where businesses can interact,
   but it is weak in key areas, such as security, which is critically
   important to business. Terisa Systems is taking a significant step
   forward in enabling electronic commerce by providing a standard
   security implementation for software developers in this market."

RSA Technology

   Terisa Systems' Secure-HTTP toolkits will use RSA public key
   cryptography technology to permit spontaneous, secure communications
   between unfamiliar correspondents over non-secure, open, public
   networks. RSA's technology provides privacy through encryption and
   authentication through digital signatures. Terisa Systems will be the
   one source from which WWW application developers can obtain RSA
   security technology, complete with Secure-HTTP integration and
   support.

   Public key cryptography is a security technique that uses a matched
   pair of encryption keys. Data encrypted with an RSA public key can
   only be decrypted with the corresponding RSA secret key, and
   vice-versa. In contrast, traditional shared-key cryptography requires
   correspondents to agree on a secret encryption key before they can
   communicate. Public key cryptography avoids the need for prior
   agreement on keys, thus assuring security between unfamiliar
   correspondents.

   James Bidzos, president of RSA, said, "Rapidly growing interest in
   business use of the Internet is producing a lot of interest in our
   security technologies. Developers, however, have been looking for a
   consistent, interoperable, and quick way to incorporate these
   technologies. Terisa Systems will meet these needs by delivering RSA
   cryptography wrapped in a high-value Web security system."

NCSA Mosaic

   NCSA Mosaic, one of the most popular World Wide Web browsers, was
   developed by the National Center for Supercomputing Applications
   (NCSA) at the University of Illinois. Mosaic is a multi-platform
   program with a point-and-click user interface for accessing the
   Internet and is primarily known for its ability to view multimedia
   World Wide Web information. NCSA also distributes NCSA HTTPD, a WWW
   server software package that makes information available to Mosaic and
   other WWW browsers. The first toolkits from Terisa Systems will
   include support for implementation of Secure-HTTP in NCSA Mosaic and
   NCSA HTTPD.

   In April, EIT, RSA, and NCSA announced an agreement to jointly develop
   and distribute secure versions of NCSA Mosaic and NCSA HTTPD based on
   RSA's public key cryptography and EIT's Secure-HTTP software. The
   enhancements are to be made available to NCSA for widespread public
   distribution for non-commercial use; Terisa Systems will now assume
   the responsibility of providing these versions. Terisa Systems'
   commercial line of toolkits and support systems will further enhance
   the secure Mosaic and HTTPD implementations with additional
   performance, functions and support options.

   According to Joseph Hardin, director of the group that developed NCSA
   Mosaic, "Mosaic's growth in the marketplace has been explosive, and
   has positioned it as the application of choice for users of the World
   Wide Web. With Secure-HTTP, Mosaic can become a framework for
   companies to engage easily in routine commerce on the Internet. By
   providing a standard source for toolkits and support, Terisa Systems
   will address the need of developers to implement Secure-HTTP
   applications quickly so they can compete in the World Wide Web
   marketplace."

Products and Services

   Terisa Systems will deliver a full line of toolkits and services.



   SecureWeb Viewer Developer's Toolkit
          Intended for developers of World Wide Web clients, this toolkit
          is used to create viewers and other applications that can
          communicate with Secure-HTTP enhanced WWW servers. In addition,
          the toolkit will include a facility for managing multiple
          certificates and keys, enabling, for example, the automatic
          selection of an appropriate key through negotiation with the
          server. User interface components will provide
          easy-to-understand control over secure communications, using
          icons to make clear the status of confidential or digitally
          signed documents and other information.

   SecureWeb Server Developer's Toolkit
          Intended for developers of World Wide Web servers, this toolkit
          facilitates the creation of WWW servers that communicate with
          Secure-HTTP enhanced viewers. The toolkit addresses the more
          demanding server aspects of key and certificate administration.
          It includes tools for storing and managing multiple keys and
          certificates, associating appropriate keys with requests for
          particular documents, and managing the revocation of
          certificates and keys. It also will provide a stronger and more
          manageable document access control system.

   Certificates
          Certificates are central to the use of public keys, for they
          guarantee public key authenticity. While Secure-HTTP works with
          hierarchical public key certificates issued by major
          institutions, in the future, Terisa Systems plans to provide
          toolkits that allow organizations to issue their own
          certificates. These certificates, called "lightweight" because
          they may not be supported by rigorous user validation, enable
          businesses to manage the certification process and issue their
          own certificates.

   Availability
          Initial implementations of Secure-HTTP and Secure-HTTPD will be
          provided to NCSA in September, 1994 for subsequent
          non-commercial distribution. Fully-supported Terisa Systems
          commercial security products will be available in the fourth
          quarter of 1994.

   In addition to toolkits, Terisa Systems will provide full support
   services, including technical support, tutorials, training, an on-line
   information service and custom consulting.

   RSA Data Security Inc., Redwood City, Calif., invented the leading
   public key cryptography system and performs basic research and
   development in cryptography. RSA markets software that facilitates the
   integration of their technology into applications.
