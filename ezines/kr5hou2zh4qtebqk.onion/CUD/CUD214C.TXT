***  CuD #2.14: File 3 of 8: CPSR'S FOIA action with the FBI     ***
********************************************************************

CPSR entered its first appearance today in federal district court in the
case CPSR v. FBI.  CPSR is seeking information from the FBI under the
Freedom of Information Act regarding the monitoring and surveillance of
computer bulletin boards used by political and advocacy organizations.

Judge Stanley Harris began the status call by indicating that the case
would be transferred to the newest member of the Court, Judge Michael
Boudin, son of the late civil rights attorney Leonard Boudin.  He mentioned
in passing that the decision to transfer the case was "made by a computer"
and that he "had nothing to do with it."

Judge Harris asked the parties to go ahead with their motions so that the
proceeding would not be delayed.  Assistant US Attorney Mark Nagle
indicated that the FBI had located one document responsive to CPSR's
request and that he expected the FBI would release this document shortly
without any sections excised.  He said that the government would then file
by January 15 a motion for summary judgment.

David Sobel, CPSR Counsel, and Marc Rotenberg, appearing as co-counsel,
then indicated to the Court that CPSR would likely challenge the adequacy
of the FBI's search for responsive documents.

Marc Rotenberg CPSR Washington Office.
