***  CuD #2.10: File 5 of 9: Censorship outside the U.S.        ***
********************************************************************

The discussion so far has been concentrated on North America, but I would like
to maken another point. In the USA a lot of BBS are censored. But because all
those networks are interconnected and the NSF is an American organisation the
'American' problem is exported, the values and American way of life are
exported. It isn't simply owning the computers or networks or not.

It isn't possible for me as a European to download X rated pictures.  from
European sites. Everybody must be able to get access to information,
uncensored. I don't like that people with other ideas are modifying my
information. No access to X rated pictures? So what?... But what is next ....
You can point out that it is only a technical problem.  simply ignored.

some messages from ip sites in finland.

Sorry, we had to remove the gifs.
NSFnet people complained that this activity is overloading the
NA <-> Scandinavia line.

I'll check if it is possible to make GIFs available for scandinavian sites
or just for Finnish sites.

The average usage of the Finland/Sweden 64kb line has lately been over 70% --
this means that it will have to be upgraded to a 2M line (costing over k$25
per month) very shortly.  Even one ftp connection will eat up the available
bandwidth very effectively.

Finland is supposedly the only Scandinavian country with more stuff being
sent out than being pumped in.  A recent traffic study of the Australia-USA
line showed that a major portion of the traffic was actually ftps to a big
GIF site in Finland !

Of course, one can argue that this is the American's problem, why did they
have to go and censor all their GIF sites, forcing everyone from the rest of
the world to crowd here to get their pictures ?

The people at NSFNet have informed us in no uncertain terms that if we don't
do anything about it, they will pull our plug -- permanently.  With these kinds
of terrorist tactics, we have no choice but to close the GIF archives...

-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-= LUT.FI  =-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

I have been TOLD to remove all GIF pictures on LUT.FI and have also done that.
This is all due to overload on our local line from Lappeenranta to Espoo and
from thereon to the States and Australia.

Please, DO NOT upload pictures here any more.  All pictures will be removed as
soon as they are found.
