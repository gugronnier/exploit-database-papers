The "Good Times Virus" is a Urban Legend. In reality it is composed of the
mass mailing of spurious warnings like the above from those who
(admittedly) are trying to be helpful.

Here is the real story (Note that date on the warning to see how long this

Number 94-04c:December 8, 1994

Welcome to the fourth issue of CIAC Notes! This is a special edition
to clear up recent reports of a "good times" virus-hoax.  Let us know
if you have topics you would like addressed or have feedback on what
is useful and what is not. Please contact the editor, Allan L. Van
Lehn, CIAC, 510-422-8193 or send E-mail to ciac@llnl.gov.

THE "Good Times" VIRUS IS AN URBAN LEGEND

In the early part of December, CIAC started to receive information
requests about a supposed "virus" which could be contracted via
America OnLine, simply by reading a message.  The following is the
message that CIAC received:

 Here is some important information.  Beware of a file called Goodtimes.

 Happy Chanukah everyone, and be careful out there. There is a virus on America
 Online being sent by E-Mail. If you get anything called "Good Times",
 DON'T read it or download it.  It is a virus that will erase your hard
 drive.  Forward this to all your friends.  It may help them a lot.

THIS IS A HOAX.  Upon investigation, CIAC has determined that this message
originated from both a user of America Online and a student at a university
at approximately the same time, and it was meant to be a hoax.

CIAC has also seen other variations of this hoax, the main one is that
any electronic mail message with the subject line of "xxx-1" will
infect your computer.

This rumor has been spreading very widely.  This spread is due mainly
to the fact that many people have seen a message with "Good Times" in
the header.  They delete the message without reading it, thus
believing that they have saved themselves from being attacked.
These first-hand reports give a false sense of credibility to the
alert message.

There has been one confirmation of a person who received a message
with "xxx-1" in the header, but an empty message body.  Then, (in a
panic, because he had heard the alert), he checked his PC for viruses
(the first time he checked his machine in months) and found a
pre-existing virus on his machine.  He incorrectly came to the
conclusion that the E-mail message gave him the virus (this particular
virus could NOT POSSIBLY have spread via an E-mail message).  This
person then spread his alert.

As of this date, there are no known viruses which can infect merely
through reading a mail message.  For a virus to spread some program
must be executed.  Reading a mail message does not execute the mail
message.  Yes, Trojans have been found as executable attachments to
mail messages, the most notorious being the IBM VM Christmas Card
Trojan of 1987, also the TERM MODULE Worm (reference CIAC Bulletin
B-7) and the GAME2 MODULE Worm (CIAC Bulletin B-12).  But this is not
the case for this particular "virus" alert.

If you encounter this message being distributed on any mailing lists,
simply ignore it or send a follow-up message stating that this is a
false rumor.

Subject--New Maillist battles Omnibus Terrorism Bill/Join NOW!

The Omnibus Counterterrorism Bill was languishing in Congress before
The Oklahoma Bombing.  It is now on the fast track and needs to be stopped
or at least changed drastically so that it does not infringe on our
rights as Citizens.  A concise description of what this bill represents
follows the subscribe information to this list.

Please post information relevant to fighting or making this bill more
constitutional as this bill in both the house and senate makes a mockery
of the constituiton.  This is a non-partison issue that has people on
the right, the left and the middle raising eyebrows.  THIS IS NOT A
RIGHT WING ANGRY WHITE MALE ISSUE!

The listowner (me) is an Angry White Jewish Male who sees grave dangers
should it be voted on in its present state.  This list is not going to be
a discussion list about whether the bill is good or bad, I think it is bad
and it is my list.  So, if you think it is good, then feel free to join, but
do not inhibit or dilute the momentum of this list.  I am a private
individual who pays for the list traffic on the webcom.com service.

If you would like to join you must decide whether you wish to join the
reflected list where each message sent creates a new message in your
mailbox, or the digest which lumps them all together for the day and
sends many messages in one email post.

And now a description of the Terrorism Bill


 Omnibus Counterterrorism Bill - S. 390 and H.R. 896

 New FBI Charter To Investigate Political Groups

      February 10, 1995 the Omnibus Counterterrorism Bill was
 introduced as S. 390 into the Senate and as H.R. 896 in the
 House. It was initiated by the FBI, and passed on by the Justice
 Department and the White House. Senators Biden (D-DE) and Specter
 (R-PA) initiated it in the Senate, Rep. Schumer (D-NY) and Dicks
 (D-WA) in the House. It has bipartisan support and could get
 expedited action.

 Summary

 * This is a general charter for the FBI and other agencies,
 including the military, to investigate political groups and
 causes at will. The bill is a wide-ranging federalization of
 different kinds of actions applying to both citizens and
 non-citizens. The range includes acts of violence (attempts,
 threats and conspiracies) as well as giving funds for
 humanitarian, legal activity.

 * It would allow up to 10 year sentences for citizens and
 deportation for permanent resident non-citizens for the "crime"
 of supporting the lawful activities of an organization the
 President declares to be "terrorist", as the African National
 Congress, FMLN in El Salvador, IRA in Northern Ireland, and PLO
 have been labelled. It broadens the definition of terrorism. The
 President's determination of who is a terrorist is unappealable,
 and specifically can include groups regardless of any legitimate
 activity they might pursue.

 * It authorizes secret trials for immigrants who are not charged
 with a crime but rather who are accused of supporting lawful
 activity by organizations which have also been accused of
 committing illegal acts. Immigrants could be deported1) using
 evidence they or their lawyers would never see; 2) in secret
 proceedings; 3) with one sided appeals; 4) using illegally
 obtained evidence.

 * It suspends posse comitatus - allowing the use of the military
 to aid the police regardless of other laws.

 * It reverses the presumption of innocence - the accused is
 presumed ineligible for bail and can be detained until trial.

 * It loosens the rules for wiretaps. It would prohibit probation
 as a punishment under the act - even for minor nonviolent
 offenses.

 Implications

 * Those who remember the McCarran Walter Act will recognize this
 bill, only in some ways this is broader and potentially more
 dangerous.

 * This bill is highly politicalthe President can determine who
 is a terrorist and change his/her mind at will and even for
 economic reasons. The breadth of its coverage would make it
 impossible for the government to prosecute all assistance to
 groups around the world that have made or threatened to commit
 violent acts of any sort. Necessarily its choices would be
 targeted at organizations the government found currently
 offensive. People to be deported would be chosen specifically
 because of their political associations and beliefs.

 * The new federal crimeinternational terrorism doesn't cover
 anything that is not already a crime. As the Center for National
 Security Studies notes"Since the new offense does not cover
 anything that is not already a crime, the main purpose of the
 proposal seems to be to avoid certain constitutional and
 statutory protections that would otherwise apply."

 * While many provisions of this bill could well be found
 unconstitutional after years of litigation, in the mean time the
 damage could be enormous to the First Amendment and other
 constitutional rights including presumption of innocence and
 right to bail.

Description:

The Annual All-Affiliates Meeting of The Playing To Win Network
brings together Network affiliate members, potential affiliates,
associates, friends, supporters and other persons interested in
learning more about how community-based technology programs can and
do provide technology access to underserved and disenfranchised
peoples. In addition to gaining practical program development
information, participants will learn how programs throughout the PTW
Network are working and collaborating to open the doors to
technology in their communities. Panel discussions, workshops, and
training sessions will be led by affiliate members, PTW Network
project staff and consultants, as well as representatives from
public policy and public interest organizations. Opportunities for
informal socializing will include group lunches and a Friday night
reception sponsored by The Morino Institute.

    DISENFRANCHISED COMMUNITIES AND THE INFORMATION SUPERHIGHWAY
                          Co-Sponsored with
          THE WORKING GROUP AGAINST INFORMATION REDLINING

                Thursday, June 1st, 7:30 -- 9:30 p.m.
                        Radison Barcelo Hotel
                           2121 "P" St. NW

The Working Group Against Information Redlining, a coalition of
primarily Washington-based organizations concerned with low-income
community access to the National Information Infrastructure (NII),
and the Playing to Win Network of community technology centers invite
you to join us on June 1, from 7:30 to 9:30 p.m. to exchange ideas
and information on our efforts to ensure that the gap between the
haves and have-nots is not replicated (much less widened) in the
deployment of the Information Superhighway.

At the meeting on June 1st, we will distribute information about the
proposed community telecommunication forums and resources we are both
planning. We will want to discuss with you your possible
participation and your ideas about content and community needs.

WHAT WE ARE ABOUT:

Universal access has become a major concern in building the NII.
Community-based non-profits in rural and disdvantaged areas lack
affordable access  to the information superhighway as well as a voice
in the development of  the content it will carry. Will the
information be relevant to community  needs?  Will people have the
capacities and resources to make use of it and be active
contributors? If so, how will that be determined?

There is growing interest in people speaking for and about low-income
and other disenfranchised individuals. However, there is little in
the way of these individuals speaking for themselves in order to
shape the debate and policies in ways beneficial to them.  In the
long run, empowering affected populations to speak for themselves
will be essential. Resources for using the NII are limited:  when and
where communities have come to understand the real opportunities this
"highway" could open up for them -- access to education and
educational resources, access to medical information and (potentially
treatment), access to needed governmental information and benefits,
training opportunities, job opportunities -- they don't have the
resources (financial, human, or technical) to take advantage of what
is already available. Capacity building will be an essential
component even if the NII is technically designed to reach all
people.

Toward this end, the Working Group Against Information Redlining has
been meeting on a monthly basis since May 1994. The groups
participating -- OMB Watch, RTK NET (the Right-to-Know Network), the
Benton Foundation,  Alliance for Public Technology, Alliance for
Community Media, the National Council of Nonprofit Associations, the
National Trust for the Development of African American Men, the
National Consumer Law Center and numerous others -- have developed a
proposal for community forums on non-profit access to and use of the
NII. The Playing to Win Network, consisting of over 50 neighborhood
community technology programs, is currently planning a program
focusing on using telecommunications to heighten participants'
interest in and involvement with local, state, and national policies
upon which their technology access rests.

These community forums and center resource projects will be discussed
at the June 1st gathering. For more information on the June 1st
program or either project, contact:
