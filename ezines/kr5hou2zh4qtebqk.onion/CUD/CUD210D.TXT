 Background
 ***********

 The EFF has, for the past three months, been involved with an extensive series
 of events  concerning pending legislation in the state of Massachusetts
 concerning computer crime.   Unbeknownst to almost everyone a computer crime
 bill had passed both houses of the Massachusetts legislature and was sitting
 on the Governor's desk awaiting signature.
 The original bill had a number of fundamental flaws, not the least of which
 was the unproven assumption that a bill which broadly criminalized whole
 ranges of computer-related activities was even called for.  In fact, the bill
 appeared to operate from the same set of assumptions that we have seen too
 often in other EFF activities:  an untested belief that more regulation is
 necessarily better and a disregard for the consequences of such an approach in
 stifling free speech and ordinary commerce.  The result was a bill which was
 both unwise as well as unconstitutional.

 The bill, while arguably well-intentioned, would have had severe unintended
 consequences such as  making it a criminal act to teach a course in computer
 security and making a criminal of  a software customer who failed to renew a
 license agreement.

 In addition, there was virtually no real input into the process which led to
 the bill's passage, although the formalities were followed.

 For these reasons the EFF joined with the Software Council in requesting the
 Governor veto the bill.  Through a series of meetings with the Governor, his
 staff, the Attorney General, the Bar Association, and members of the Council,
 we were able to work out a compromise.  It can be said without exaggeration
 that the EFF played the key role in this process.  Sharon Beckman, in
 particular, was invaluable in spearheading the legal work, including the
 drafting of a replacement bill.

 The Bill Itself
 *************

 The language of the bill now balances property and free speech interests, and
 is the first such legislation to do so, as far as we know.  As such, after its
 passage, it can serve as model legislation for other states as well as the
 country as a whole.

 The preamble of the bill  explicitly recognizes that the integrity of computer
 systems must be protected in a way which does not infringe on the rights of
 users of computer technology, including freedoms of speech, association, and
 privacy.

 In its first provision, the bill makes it a crime to knowingly and without
 authorization access a controlled computer system with the intention of
 causing damage and actually cause damage in excess of $10,000.  The second
 provision of the bill is identical to the one above except that it covers
 activities undertaken with reckless disregard of the consequences as opposed
 to intent to cause damage and carries a lesser penalty.

 The bill breaks new ground is in the area of enforcement.  Prosecutions may be
 brought only by the Attorney General and only after guidelines are established
 regarding the conduct of search and seizure operations.  These guidelines must
 be consistent with the concerns stated in the preamble.

 The bill also establishes a 17 person commission charged with recommending
 future legislation in this area.

 The Task Ahead
 ***************

 Now that the Governor has sent a revised bill back to the Legislature, it is
 up to them.  We will be meeting with the Legislative co-sponsors of the bill
 in the next few weeks to find out where they stand and, we hope, gather their
 support.

 Here is the text of the bill itself

 Proposed text of Mass. Computer Crime Bill


   Carefully balancing the need to make unlawful entry into
   computer systems a criminal offense against the need to protect
   the privacy and First Amendment rights of users of computers
   has, and remains, a basic tenet guiding Massachusetts efforts
   to prevent computer crime.  To better strike this vital
   balance, and pursuant to authority vested in me by Article LVI
   of the Amendments to the Massachusetts Constitution, I am
   returning for amendment S.1543, "An Act Prohibiting Certain
   Acts Relative to Computers, Computer Data and Computer
   Systems".

   S.1543 would have the unintended effect of restricting access
   to computers by legitimate users.  Such restricted access would
   inadvertently chill the energy and creativity which are the
   hallmarks of Massachusetts business and industry.
   I agree with the bill's sponsors that there is a need for
   Massachusetts to make more clear that it is a crime to
   unlawfully enter some one else's computer system and through
   reckless or intentional behavior cause harm or damage.
   Therefore, in lieu of vetoing S. 1543, I recommend that it be
   amended by striking the language of the bill in its entirety
   and substituting in its place the following:


   AN ACT PROHIBITING CERTAIN ACTS RELATIVE TO COMPUTERS AND
   COMPUTER SYSTEMS.

   Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives in
   General Court assembled and by the authority of same, as
   follows:

 SECTION 1.      The General Court hereby finds and declares that the
 development of computer technology has given rise to new communication,
 privacy and property interests of importance to individuals,
 businesses, and government agencies in this Commonwealth.  The
 protection of computer systems is therefore vital to the welfare of
 individuals and businesses in the Commonwealth.

   The General court also finds and declares that computers and
   computer networks have enabled new forms of communication,
   including electronic publications, electronic bulletin boards,
   electronic conferences, and electronic mail,m which are
   protected by fundamental rights, including freedom of speech
   and association and freedom from unreasonable governmental
   intrusion.

   It is the intention of this act to protect the integrity of
   computer systems without infringing on the rights described
   above and without impeding the use and development of computer
   and communications technology.

 Therefore, the General Laws are hereby amended by inserting after
 chapter 266 the following chapter:

               Chapter 266A.
 SECTION: 1.

 (A)     Whoever knowingly accesses a controlled access computer system
 knowing such access to be without authorization and knowingly causes
 the transmission of a program, information, code or command to a
 computer or computer system, without authorization and intending that
 such program, information, code or command will damage or cause damage
 to a computer, computer system, network, information, data or program,
 or withhold or deny, or cause the withholding or denial, of the use of a
 computer, computer services, system or network, information, data or
 program, and thereby causes loss or damage to one or more other persons
 of $10,000 or more shall be punished by imprisonment in a jail or house
 of correction for not more that 2 1/2 years, or a fine of not more than
 25,000 or both.

 (B)     Whoever knowingly accesses a controlled access computer system
 knowing such access to be  without authorization and knowingly causes
 the transmission of a program, information, code or command to a
 computer or computer system, without authorization and with  reckless
 disregard of a substantial and unjustifiable risk that such program,
 information, code or command will damage or cause damage to a computer,
 computer system, network, information, data or program, or withhold or
 deny, or cause the withholding or denial, of the use of a computer,
 computer services, system, or network, information, data or program,
 and thereby causes loss or damage to one or more other persons of
 $10,000 or more shall be punished by imprisonment in a jail or house of
 corrections for not more than 1 year, or a fine of not more than $5000,
 or both.

 (C)     Prosecutions, Investigations, and Reporting by the Attorney
 General

   (1) Prosecutions under this section shall be brought only by
   the Attorney General.

   (2)  Any Application for a warrant to conduct a search or
   seizure of a computer, computer system, or electronic
   communication system under this section must be approved by the
   Attorney General or an Assistant Attorney General.

   (3)  The Attorney General shall, within six months of the
   effective data of this Act, issue guidelines for the procedures
   governing the investigation and prosecution of an offense under
   this section, incorporating in such guidelines a requirement
   that violations of this section be investigated by methods that
   are least restrictive of the rights of freedom of speech and
   association and the right to privacy implicated in computer
   systems, and least disruptive to legitimate use of computer
   systems, without jeopardizing compelling law enforcement
   interests.

      Such guidelines shall not provide a basis for dismissal
      of an otherwise proper complaint brought under this
      sections or for exclusion of evidence that is otherwise
      admissible in a proceeding under this section.

   (4)     The Attorney General shall collect and compile
   information on, and report to the General Court annually on,
   searches, seizures, and prosecutions commenced pursuant to this
   section.

 SECTION:        2.
      There is hereby established a study commission on
      computer technology and the law.  The Commission shall
      consist of sixteen members who shall serve without
      compensation.  Notwithstanding any provision of section
      six of chapter two hundred and sixty-eight A to the
      contrary, the commission shall consist of the attorney
      general or his designee who shall be chairman, the
      secretary of the executive office of economic affairs
      or his designee, the senate chair of the joint
      committee on criminal justice, the house chair of the
      joint committee on criminal justice, and twelve persons
      appointed by the governor, including two
      representatives from the Massachusetts Software Council
      and one representative of each of the following
      organizations, to be selected from a list of
      recommendations provided by that organization: the
      Massachusetts Bar Association, the Boston Bar
      Association, the state council of the AFL-CIO, the
      Boston Computer Society, and one representative from
      the computer hardware industry, one r

   Said Commission shall investigate the legitimate communication,
   privacy, and property interests of individuals, businesses, and
   government agencies within this Commonwealth implicated by new
   computer technologies and shall evaluate the sufficiency of
   existing Massachusetts law to protect and preserve those
   interests.

   The Commission shall report to the General Court the results of
   its investigation and study, and its recommendations, together
   with drafts of legislation to carry its recommendations into
   effect, by filing its report with the clerk of the house of
   representatives and with the clerk of the senate on or
