LOD UPDATE (May 9, 1990):
----------

The legal fate of Craig Neidorf (Knight Lightning) is still uncertain.
Motions are currently pending to dismiss the case, and the defense
attorneys are also waiting for rulings on their discovery motions. They
hope to have responses by the end of the May. A status hearing has been set
for May 29, and the trial is scheduled for June 18.  Barring something
dramatic, it appears there will be nothing to report for at least three
more weeks.  The case is in Illinois' Northern Federal District (Chicago),
and the docket number is 90-CR-70.

The trial of Robert Riggs and Adam Grant was originally scheduled for
June 4 in Atlanta, but has been delayed, according to court sources.
They indicate that the new trial date will likely be in July or August.
Rumors of a plea bargaining arrangement *HAVE NOT* been confirmed, and
sources indicate that the prosecution is currently intending to procede to
trial. However, this was an "official" position, and did not preclude the
possibility of a bargaining arrangement being negotiated.
The case number in Georgia's Northern District is:  1:90-CR-31

FTP PROBLEMS:
----------

As many noticed, a bitnet site cannot actually be an FTP site.  The bitnet
address was intended as the source by which users could be steered over to
a workable site. It may not work as well in practice as conceived in the
abstract. We are working on the problem, and will have more information
in the next issue.
requests as we can and then place the files on a central BBS that
accomodates 9600 baud. For those with the new HSTs, this take about 10
minutes for a one-meg download (at a cost of about $1.25). For those still
using 2400, it would cost about $11.00. This isn't ideal, but it's
workable.

BBS INFO WANTED
-----------

We've had some interesting responses to our query about BBSs.  In coming
issues, we'll try to do a series on the history of CU bulletin boards, when
they started, what happened to them, and what's going on now. If you were
(or are) the sysop of a CU board that has been around for a few years, or
if you were a user of one, drop us a note on when it started, what it
caters to, what it's like, or any other information you think relevant.
WE'RE NOT LOOKING FOR BBS ADS, so don't send any. The intent is to trace
the rather dymanic and rapidly changing nature of this form of social
interaction.
