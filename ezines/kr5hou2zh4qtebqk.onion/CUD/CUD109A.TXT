Operation Sun Devil
-----------

Operation Sun Devil, another phase in the crackdown against the computer
underground, was begun May 8 (See this issue, Files 3 and 4). At least 28
search warrants were served, and a number of arrests have resulted,
although not all directly related to the May 8 operation.  Judging from
comments we have received, people are either quite angry about it or highly
supportive of it. We will give our own views in File #3, but we urge you to
send reasoned opinions on either side.

One of the best commentaries of the entire crackdown can be in Emmanuel
Goldstein's articles in 2600 MAGAZINE (May 15, 1990).  People can contact
2600/M at:
      2600@well.sf.ca.us     OR
      2600 EDITORIAL DEPARTMENT
      P.O. BOX 99,
      MIDDLE ISLAND, NY 11953

We will have an expanded article on Sun Devil in CuD #1.10

SUBJECT:  FTP SITE (FILE TRANSFER PERSON)
TO:       TK0JUT2


OK EVERYONE. THE "FTP" SIGHT IS REALLY REFERRING TO A FILE TRANSFER PERSON
WHICH IS ME. TO REQUEST A FILE SEND MESSAGE CONTAINING THE FOLLOWING
INFORMATION:

   1. YOUR NETWORK ADDRESS
   2. WHAT FILES YOU WANT (GIVE ME AN EXACT IDEA IE. ISSUES 1-12 OF PHRACK)

AFTER RECEIVING YOUR REQUEST, I WILL SEND YOU A MESSAGE THAT I HAVE
RECEIVED YOUR REQUEST. THIS WILL SERVE TWO PURPOSES, THE FIRST TO LET YOU
KNOW THAT I RECEIVED YOUR REQUEST AND TO LET ME MAKE SURE THAT THE FILES
WILL GET TO YOU.

YOU SHOULD RECEIVE THE FILES WITHIN A 48 HOURS TIME PERIOD AND ALL PAST
REQUESTS WILL BE SENT THIS WEEKEND.  AT THIS TIME I HAVE ALL OF PHRACK
(EXCEPT ISSUE 24 AND WE WON'T WANT TO SEND THAT ONE NOW WOUDLD WE), LOD
TECH JOURNALS, AND P/HUN. I WILL BE RECEIVING THE REST OF THE ATI AND
PIRATE ARTICLES SOON.  ALSO IF YOU HAVE A LIST OF FILES THAT
YOU WOULD LIKE TO SHARE WITH EVERYONE, INCLUDE THAT LIST WITH YOUR REQUEST.
HOPEFULLY THIS METHOD OF FILE TRANSFER WILL ONLY BE FOR A WHILE SINCE I AM
IN THE MIDST OF HUNTING DOWN A FTP SITE.

                             DARKMAGE

RIPCO
-------------

Ripco was one of the boards that went down on May 8. It was probably the
longest running decent board in the country. Judging from our knowledge of
the users and the content of the logs, less than 3 percent of the callers
claimed to be identified in illegal activity, and of those, we'd guess that
at least half were faking it. Given the nature of undercover operations,
which include "infiltrating" boards, we also assume some were law
enforcement agents. Ripco had a number of message sections, all of which
were lively, generally intelligent, and invariably interesting. Raiding
Ripco seems to be throwing the baby out with the bath water by intimidating
sysops willing to allow provocative discussions. We repeat: THE BULK OF
RIPCO'S USERS WERE NOT IN ANY WAY INVOLVED IN *ANY* ILLEGAL ACTIVITY, but
now names are in the hands of agents. We have seen from past experience
what can happen when they start generating "lists." We can see some
aggressive hot-shot prosecutor now, about to seek political office: "I HAVE
IN MY HAND A LIST OF 200 SUBVERSIVE HACKER SCUM....!" In our view, this is
no long a computer underground issue, but one of First Amendment
protections.

We reprint Dr. Ripco's final message left to his users:
******************************************************************

This is 528-5020.

As you are probably aware, on May 8, the Secret Service conducted a series
of raids across the country.  Early news reports indicate these raids
involved people and computers that could be connected with credit card and
long distance toll fraud. Although no arrests or charges were made, Ripco
BBS was confiscated on that morning.  It's involvement at this time is
unknown. Since it is unlikely that the system will ever return, I'd just l
say goodbye, and thanks for your support for the last six and a half years.
It's been interesting, to say the least.

Talk to ya later.
  %Dr. Ricpo%
