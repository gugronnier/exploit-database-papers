You may, or may not have noticed a new magazine in the cyberworld:
FBI Presents.     We at FBI are dedicated to bringing you the news, at
whatever the cost may be.  We Specialize in Anarchy And Phreaking
files, but also attempt to bring you Hacking and Carding files
whenever we find them available.

Many of our articles deal with the rights of hackers and computer
users as a whole.  So if you are interested in these, pick up a copy!

We are a monthly production, and we try to keep to our deadlines as
well as possible.

We are currently working on issue 3 of FBI Presents,  It will include
such features as...

     An Interview with Mitch Kapor of EFF,
     How To mass Mail.
     The Non-Box. (A box plan you will find VERY interesting!)

It will be available some time around the end of September.

So..  You can grab one of our previous issues at:
chsun1.spc.uchicago.edu
ashley.cs.widener.edu

IF you would like to submit an article, which I *HOPE* you will do, you can
send it to:
au530@cleveland.freenet.edu
You can also request an E-Mail subscription from this address.

So RUN to your local FTP or favorite P/H/A BBS and grab a copy of
  F B I   Presents.
