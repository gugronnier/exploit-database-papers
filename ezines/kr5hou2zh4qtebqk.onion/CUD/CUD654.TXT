Subject: File 1--Cu Digest Index, Vols 6.01 through 6.53

((MODERATORS' NOTE:  We are in the process of the semi-annual cleaning
of the mailing list. It appears that we grossly underestimated the
number of people receiving CuD via direct mail.  We hope that mailing
problems are resolved and that folks are receiving it properly.

Because of an overwhelming number of requests for the semi-annual
index, we are mailing it as a special issue.  Alan Dunkin, bless his
heart, continues to work on the complete annotated index when time
from his new job allows. Below is the "Subject" index for Volumes 6.01
through 6.53))
