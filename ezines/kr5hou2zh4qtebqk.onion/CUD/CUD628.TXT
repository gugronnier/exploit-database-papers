Subject: File 1--Downs Down On Clipper

     The  Clipper  Chip  proposal  from  the Clinton Administration --
which would essentially have government broker  individual  electronic
privacy rights -- is collecting still more opposition. One of the most
recent  opponents  to  Clipper is media icon Hugh Downs. Downs is well
known for his days as a co-host of the Today Show, host  of  the  game
show  Concentration,  and  his current position as co-host of ABC-TV's
20/20. Downs is also a respected advocate for "mature" adults.   Downs
delivered  his  "perspective" as to Clipper on the 03-27-94 edition of
ABC radio's  "PERSPECTIVES."  In  Downs'  segment,  much  cryptography
history  --  as  it relates to radio -- was explained while Downs laid
the  foundation  for  expression  of  his  opinion  on  Clipper.   The
following text is a direct transcript of Downs' summation:

       ------------- TRANSCRIPT BEGINS ------------------------

It's not designed to stop criminals from  sending  encrypted  messages
because  criminals  will  always  be  able to do that. If the NATIONAL
SECURITY AGENCY puts a  spy  chip  on  American  computers,  then  the
criminals  will  simply  avoid  the  chip and use other computers that
don't spy on them. But, it wouldn't be just criminals  who  would  buy
foreign  made computers. Anyone who wants a private life would have to
buy foreign, too. According to John Perry Barlow, who's co-founder and
Vice-chair of the Electronic Frontier Foundation, Vice President  Gore
says  he  wants  the  Clipper  Chip  installed  in  all  American-made
computers  designed  for  export. Now, you don't have to be a computer
whiz to realize that -- if American computers were forced  to  have  a
spy  chip  built  into  them  --  then fewer people would buy American
computers.

The  computer  owes  an  enormous  debt   to   cryptologists   because
cryptologists   needed   machines  to  disguise  radio  messages.  The
information highway is certainly as wide open as radio.  Indeed,  much
of  it is already radio. Cellular phones and cellular FAX will quickly
expand to cellular modem and satellite communications. As it is,  most
of  this  information  goes  out unprotected. The time has arrived for
individuals  to  have  high  levels  of  security.   The   information
superhighway  will  eventually  contain  every scrap of information we
could possibly imagine. And that means there  will  be  all  sorts  of
unscrupulous   people  out  there  trying  to  hack  into  our  lives.
Information-highwaymen are bad enough when they're fourteen years old.
But now, adults -- who work for the government -- want to play hacker,
too.  The  Clipper  spy   chip   is   bad   business   for   everyone.
Information-highway-safety should be a top priority for all of us.

 Completely true, encryption cannot be outlawed. The government is
ripping itself off by giving us powerful encryption for personal use.
But for the dark personal secrets, are we really gonna use the clip
chip? Not me! I'll use PGP or something else. Criminals aren't going to
use the chip unless they're really ignorant or blatantly idiotic. So
the government is really spending lots of money to making our lines more
secure from illegal phone tappers and such but not doing a thing for
them. I believe we're getting the better part of the deal! Do they
really want to listen in on phone calls to our relatives? I don't think
so. I promote the Clipper Chip! Thanks for the free gift!

A little dramatic here? They might win the battle but they haven't won
the war. The final battle will be when we establish a global Interactive
Television system. Then it will pit the public against the US government
and the allies it has in this dispute (if any). Nobody wants a video
camera normally used for video conferencing to be watching them in their
own living room without them even knowing it. By this time, people
will know a lot more about this scheme and most likely the public will
win this battle unless the majority of the population is as ignorant as
a two year old child to the world around them.

Subject: File 3--Gov't Regulation of BBSes in Australia

Well, it's finally on.  The Australian government has announced a task force
that is to develop options for regulating BBS'es here in Oz.  Attached is
the call for submissions which was posted to the aus.* newsgroups by
Tom Worthington of the Australian Computer Society (ACS).  Tom has given me
permission to re-post it here.  Comments can be posted to CuD, or sent to
Roger Clarke who is preparing the ACS's submission, or sent to me for
my submission.  Roger's e-mail address is roger.clarke@anu.edu.au and mine
is rhys@fit.qut.edu.au.

As odious as the prospect of BBS regulations are, there's not much that can
be done except ensure that the regulations address the concerns of the net
population rather than being railroaded through.  I for one am adamant that
any regulations have built-in protections for the network community alongside
any control measures.  Maybe we can get the much-needed "common carrier" like
protections if it is worded carefully in the submissions.

I must say that I'm not surprised at this move by the government, given the
recent stories with the usual bogey-men of "computer porn" and "information
about making bombs" that the traditional media have been reporting.  Computer
games were recently placed under the Australian censorship scheme, and BBS'es
were the next down the list. *sigh*

Any assistance would be greatly appreciated.  Any ideas, no matter how
radical are welcome: I'll take care of toning them down from the setting
of "foaming-at-the-mouth lunatic" to just plain "lunatic". :-)

Once I have a draft, I'll be sure to post it to CuD for comments before
hitting the Australian government with it.  The deadline for submissions is
29 April 1994.

Cheers,

Rhys.

ATTORNEY-GENERAL'S DEPARTMENT

Call for submissions on the regulation of computer bulletin boards

The Attorney-General and the Minister for Communications and the Arts have
established a joint Task Force to develop options for the regulation of
computer bulletin hoards.

SUBMISSIONS

The Task Force invites submissions from members of the public on options
for the regulation of computer bulletin board systems. Submissions may
include comments on the feasibility of a Code of Practice governing the
use of bulletin board systems.

TERMS OF REFERENCE

The Task Force is to consider alternatives for developing a regulatory
system that would:

* allow bulletin board users, parents and guardians to make informed
entertainment choices for themselves and those in their care: and

* provide adequate protection to children from material that mi~ht be
considered harmful or disturbing.

The Task Force is also to assess whether:

* existing Commonwealth offences covering the misuse of computers and
telecommunications services are adequate to deal with bulletin board
abuse;

* import/export restrictions are capable of controlling the international
trafficking and subsequent copying and distribution of otherwise banned
material;

* State and Territory laws such as those dealing with the misuse of
computers and possession of child pornography are adequate to deal with
bulletin boards;

* current law enforcement powers are adequate to deal with the new
technology; and

* specific offences should be enacted for the use of bulletin boards for
unlawful purposes.

Subject: File 4--Hacking (Broken) Hearts

((First The Well's "Cyber-Lothario" and now this--ah, true love
ain't easy))

                 "Cops Say Love Claims are Off-line"
         From: Chicago Tribune, March 25, 1994 (Sect 2, p. 6)

     The trail of a computer love bandit who used on-line
     services to lure wealthy women into romantic relationships
     only to swindle them and break their hearts has ended in
     Park Forest (Ill.), police said Thursday.

The article explains that Conrad Grohs, 41, was served with warrants,
including one for bigamy, from three states, after a Pennsylvania
woman reported her suspicions to authorities.

Printouts of correspondence from Groh's computer on-line ruse
tipped her off, Park Forest Detective Patrick Fitzgerald said.

     "He was corresponding with a recently  divorced woman whose
     ex-husband had come into several million dollars,"
     Fitzgerald said.  "He wanted her to go aftr it. Of course,
     he was going to be waiting in the wings to relieve her of
     it.

The article adds that Grohs met the Pennsylvania woman through an
electronic BBS. She invited him to stay with her in Park Forest at her
parent's home. He claimed to be writing a book.  He was held in Cook
County Jail while authorities continued their investigation.

Subject: File 5--"Reality Bites" (Superhighway revisited)

((MODERATORS' NOTE: The following comes from CRYPT NEWS LETTER,
available from Urnst Couch at:  70743.1711@COMPUSERVE.COM)).

      REALITY BITES, BUT IT BEATS THE HELL OUT OF OTHER PEOPLE'S
                             PIPE DREAMS
    by Mr. Badger (Andy Lopez), mrbadger@ttps.lakes.trenton.sc.us.

Cracks in the glistening tarmac of the Information Superhighway are
appearing.  You wouldn't know it from reading the euphoric delusions
of the techno-journalists, who as a class excel at two things:
swallowing corporate manure and shoveling it into others.

Again, I say ignore the pipe-dreamers with their grand visions of
virtual reality, virtual communities, virtual sex.  It's virtual
sewage.

The clash between reality and the Information Superhighway image will
be brutal, but prolonged.  Brutal, because reality has all the tact,
diplomacy, and professionalism of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and
Firearms.  Prolonged, because dreams won't die easily and delusions
never surrender.

The ignorant and the stupid will see their crazed leaders speak of
glorious counterattacks even as they are shelled from the west and
looted by the east.  When the smoke has cleared, they'll be left with
an empty shell, a fiction so transparent and fake that only
intellectual cripples and those who've thrown away large investments
will still be convinced there's substance to it.

First of this month's flaws in the Information Highway Weltanschauung,
Barron's (March 14, 1994) front page, asks:

        "STILL GOING?  In all the rhapsodizing about the
         telecommunications revolution one fact has been sadly
         overlooked:  Nobody has come up with a portable battery that
         last more than a few hours.  For users of laptop PCs and
         cellular phones, when will the frustration end?"

The story starts with a couple of anecdotes that illustrate the
obvious problems with batteries:  they don't last long enough, it's
inconvenient to carry extras, and battery chargers tie the consumer
back into plug-in power.  The story ends with a summary of future
options:  pay more, carry heavier batteries, take chances on unproven
technology, and ho-hum brrrr-zzzzzzz.  Sorry, if we're not
enthusiastic, but that hardly seems like a solution.  Further, it's
not news.

On other fronts, the Economist (February 26, 1994) notes the much
vaunted, state-supported, Japanese high definition television (HDTV)
standard is deader than the albatross in "The Rhyme of the Ancient
Mariner".  Now analysts are expecting the newly created American
standard to be adopted by both Europe and Japan.  True, the Japanese
standard was analogue, but that hardly explains why, after two years
of HDTV broadcasts, only 20,000 sets have sold.  The Economist chalks
that up to the outrageous cost of HDTV units, and ends with a quote
that serves as warning to industrialists betting on a high-tech,
home-based interface to electronic services.

        "Will viewers pay big sums simply for sharper pictures?  The
         jury is out.  But the only person better at killing off a
         technology than a well-intentioned regulator is a commonsense
         consumer."

In other words, don't bet the farm that the information highway is
going to be high-tech, either.

More ominous, Newsweek is starting to doubt.  Seeing Newsweek question
the glorious future of all that is digital is like seeing the town
whore filling out correspondence Bible courses from the Church
Universal and Triumphant.  You can't help but be impressed at the
change, nor can you resist making mental bets on how long it will last
(not long at all, in this case).

"Sex on the Info Highway" was almost good, but by March 14 the
magazine was back on the trail of digital piffle with "Keeping the
Cybercops out of Cyberspace."

One quote in the "Sex" piece almost earned the Badger seal of
approval, but almost only counts in horseshoes and quoits, which - I
might add - I detest.  It read:


        "The quality of much cyberporn varies from low to dreadful.
         While the idea of electronic dirty talk may seem titillating,
         the reality is often pathetic--or worse, boring.  A lot of
         the time, participants discuss techniques.  The tone isn't
         all that different from that of computer forums on auto
         repair; only the tools vary.  Downloading X-rated pictures
         takes time and concentration; users need a special program to
         translate digital blips into flesh-and-blood tones.  Often,
         the amateurish results aren't worth the effort.  Even many
         professionally produced products, such as CD-ROMs, are little
         more than dirty movies copied onto a disc.  Because CD drives
         are slower than VCRs, the viewer sees nothing more than a
         series of jerky images."

"Downloading takes . . . concentration . . . " My ass. It's such a
frankly idiotic claim it must have been the product of the
writing-by-committee techniques which makes Newsweek such a wretched
example of contemporary journalism.

However, the rest finally showed some common sense:

1. Computers are an awful medium for pornography, period, and

2. Pornography ain't exactly the most demanding of arts, either.

"Keeping the Cybercops Out of Cyberspace," however, was little more
than a glorified press release for the Clipper encryption chip and the
FBI's Wiretapping proposals.

Starting with an account of how Aldrich Ames, the recently caught spy,
did _not_ use encryption, "Cybercops" went on to point out that
present cryptologic techniques may be uncrackable by government
agencies.  It's assessment of the Clipper chip and the Justice
Department proposals that all switching systems accommodate FBI
wiretapping gear:

        "Sounds sensible, but the plan has civil-liberties folk in an
         uproar."

The article then blithely dismisses privacy advocates with the
fatherly, know-it-all claim:

        "The concern is understandable but overblown."

As proof, it offers:

        "'Enforcement agencies simply don't have the time to monitor
          all these things,' says John O'Leary at the Computer
          Security Institute, a public-interest group in San
          Francisco.  The Feds won't barge through your back door
          unless they suspect a crime, and then only with a court
          order."

Tell it to Steve Jackson Games and the Branch Davidians in Waco,
brainless sewer rats.  It's not particularly surprising, but still
quite dumbfounding, that editors of Newsweek practiced selective
recall of recent history when researching this piece.

It's true that the authorities won't catch everybody, but that's cold
consolation when you're on the ground taking a billyclub to the
kidneys or having all your equipment forfeited during a raid for which
the paperwork will later be declared invalid. And what happened to the
concept that the government ought to keep a jump ahead of enemies by
hard work and sheer brain power?  When did we concede that all
evil-doers have de facto technical superiority?

The final insult is the article's assessment of the business costs and
pragmatism of instituting the Clipper chip:

        "Few of the more pragmatic critics propose scrapping the
         Clipper.  Instead they suggest ways of restricting the number
         of federal officials who might have access to the master
         keys."

How's that Information Superhighway sounding now?  Mr. Badger warns of
the dire consequences of letting techno-journalists live. As usual,
we're betrayed by mainstream news organs that subsconsciously believe
the "CO" in community derives from "military industrial COmplex" or
"big COrporation."  Merciful use of Pentobarbital Sodium is warranted.
Even People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals won't squeak.

Subject: File 6--Research on MUDS (MA Thesis)

Elizabeth Reid has completed her MA thesis on MUDS (University of
Melbourne, Dept. of English, 1994), which we recommend to readers
(when it becomes available). Her previous analysis of Inter-Relay Chat
has been widely distributed and excerpted (the original IRC paper is
available on the CuD ftp sites).  Her latest work should be valuable
to researchers, journalists, and others, and nicely supplements Julian
Dibbel's recent article on "Rape in Cyberspace."

Ms. Reid's work is valuable for several reasons. Substantively, it
reflects an impressive breadth of substantive and
conceptual/theoretical knowledge that brings together a rich body of
data into a coherent framework. Intellectually, she bridges several
disciplines, especially sociology, communications studies, and
anthropology and ties them together in a sophisticated analysis of
what has become known as "cyber-culture." Thematically, her work is a
significant contribution to scholars internationally, because she
fills a vacuum in our understanding of her chosen topic, MUDS, as well
adds insights into computer-mediated communication.

One theme central to Ms. Reid's work is that of gender power and how
it is created and sustained, even playfully, in MUDS.  Emergent new
MUD norms partially mediate conventional gender and other power games,
which may lead some to believe in the potential for a more equal
playing field. As Ms. Reid suggests, this is not necessarily the case.

We will try to make Ms. Reid's work available when it is converted
into ASCII format. Those wanting additional information can contact
her directly at:  emr%munagin.ee.mu.oz.au@uunet.uu.net

Subject: File 7--Virus Sightings (humor)

We've been having some famous virus sitings here, just as a
response to the folks who have the virus contest.

We're trying to encourage the use of virus scanning software
on PC's...here are
some examples of what we're trying to detect and prevent!

*****

BOBBIT VIRUS: Removes a vital part of your hard disk then
re- attaches it.
(But that part will never work again.)

OPRAH WINFREY VIRUS: Your 200MB hard drive suddenly
shrinks to 80MB, and then
slowly expands back to 200MB.

AT&T VIRUS: Every three minutes it tells you what great
service you are
getting.

MCI VIRUS: Every three minutes it reminds you that you're
paying too much for
the AT&T virus.

PAUL REVERE VIRUS: This revolutionary virus does not horse
around. It warns
you of impending hard disk attack---once if by LAN, twice if
by C:>.

    ScratchPad 2.0 Lets Chiropractors Use EOs for Notetaking
                       by David Batterson


RIVER RIDGE, LOUISIANA--Greycat, Inc. has released ScratchPad 2.0,
the latest version of its chiropractic exam forms software for the
AT&T EO Personal Communicators.  Using ScratchPad, the D.C. can
conduct patient exams and take notes--without a bar code system,
desktop PC, or paper and pen.

     Since today's healthcare environment has meant an avalanche of
paperwork to manage, most doctors and healthcare professionals are
searching for ways to eliminate much of the paper while finding more
efficient ways to manage patient data.  In conjunction with the EO's
PenPoint operating system, ScratchPad turns handwriting or print into
screen text.  Also, shorthand notations can be transcribed into full-
length sentences.

     With ScratchPad and an EO 440 or 880 Personal Communicator, the
doctor has a hand-held method for managing all SOAP (Subjective
Objective Assessment Plan)/clinic notes.  To locate a patient's
folder and review prior visits, the doctor writes in the patient's
last name or identification number, and taps with the pen.

     John Gambale, senior design specialist at Greycat, said they are
now working on a new ScratchPad module called a narrative generation
package.  This is used "for lawsuits and other legal purposes,"
Gambale said, "where a doctor has to provide a summary of daily
notes."  The new module is planned for a "late summer" release,
according to Gambale.

     On the back burner is a new ScratchPad for general practitioner
medical doctors.  Gambale said they hoped to have it launched by the
end of 1994.

    Bart Bishop, D.C., a chiropractor in Whittier, Calif., said that
the ScratchPad system was a real money-saver for his practice.
"Previously," Dr. Bishop said, "I was spending about $4000 a year in
transcriptions.  Now I've cut it down to around $1,100 per year."

    Dr. Bishop said he does very little handwriting input, relying
mostly on just tapping on boxes with the EO pen.  The doctor said he
previously tried the bar code method of note-taking, but said "it
just didn't work out for us.  It was too slow to use, and you
couldn't see what you were inputting."

     ScratchPad 2.0 costs $1,495.  Gambale said that virtually all
customers buy the $350/year support contract, which includes 90-day,
800-number support, and all software upgrades.

     For information, contact Greycat, Inc.,  at 800-828-2250.

   America Online is Electronic Zone for Many Gays and Lesbians
                             by David Batterson


VIENNA, VIRGINIA--America Online (AOL), which calls itself "the
nation's fastest growing provider of online services to consumers in
the U.S.," has succeeded in marketing to one particular niche
market: gay and lesbian computer users.

     While AOL doesn't yet have gay publications online, there are
many articles that cover the gay/lesbian/bisexual/transgender
community.  Those are located in the Gay and Lesbian Community Forum
(GLCF) Resource Files, as well as in online publications like the San
Jose Mercury News, Chicago Tribune, The New Republic and USA TODAY.

     AOL has a staff of over 50 in the GLCF.  There are many
community conferences and events, guest speakers, support groups,
media groups (GLADD, NGLTF, NGLJA, etc.), as well as a file library
of thousands of informational and graphics files.

     Besides the GLCF, there are other areas on AOL where there are
gay/lesbian topics, discussions, networking and information.   For
example, under the Learning & Reference section [keyword: EDUCATION],
there are folders labeled Gay and Lesbian Youth.  Under the Better
Health & Medical Forum [keyword: HEALTH], users find folders labeled
AIDS Support Group and Message Center.

     Microsoft billionaire Paul Allen now owns 25 percent of the
company's stock.  AOL continues to expand both membership and
services; it now claims more than 650,000 members.

     AOL's monthly rate is $9.95 for the first five hours of online
usage; additional time is billed at $3.50 per hour.  There's no
surcharge for prime time and 9600-bps access.  AOL offers a freetrial
membership that includes free software (DOS, Windows or Macintosh)
and 10 hours of online time.   Info: 800-827-6364.

Subject: File 9--How Clipper Actually Works

In all the anti-Clipper flaming that has been occuring I haven't
seen anything about how Clipper actually works.  I generated the
following based on a lecture in a secure computer systems class I
am taking.
 +----------------------------------------------------

Clipper Operations:

                      Chip
                +----------------+
                |                |
Message (M)  -->| Algorithm  (E) |--> Encrypted Message (B) = E [M]
                | Chip ID   (ID) |                             K
                | Chip Key   (U) |
User Key (K) -->| Family Key (F) |--> Encrypted ID and Key (A) =
                |                |             E [ID | E [K]]
                +----------------+              F       U

   Note:  E [Q]  means Encrypt Q with key R
           R
 +-----------------------------------------------------------

The User Key is a session key that is generated by the two ends
in the following manner:

    Side A                      Side B
 Generate a, X               Generate Y            a, X and Y are random #
 Send a and a^X     ------>
                             Receive a and a^X
                    <------  Send a^Y
 Receive a^Y
 Generate K=(a^Y)^X          Generate K=(a^X)^Y   ie key K=a^(XY)

So a, a^X, and a^Y can all be intercepted without giving away key.

 +----------------------------------------------------------------

So where does the government and the Key Escrow come into it?  Note the
2nd output from the clipper chip - it is the ID of the chip and an
encrypted version of the session key.  The government will know the
family key and can extract the ID.  Then they go to the two escrow
agencies (NIST and the Treasury Dept.) and get the two components of
the chip key U.  This allows the session key to be extracted and the
message to be decrypted.

Agency 1:   ID and U(A)    U(A) --+
                                  OR --> U
Agency 2:   ID and U(B)    U(B) --+

 +------------------------------------------------------

General comments:
1. The Algorithm for the clipper chip is an NSA Type II algorithm
   called Skipjack.  Type II is for unclassified, but sensitive.
2. If you could reprogram the Chip Key (U) or block the transmission
   of the encrypted ID and key this concept wouldn't be to bad.
3. The other point of vulnerability is at the manufacturing location
   where the Chip Key is originally generated.  All 3 pieces of info
   (ID, U(A), and U(B)) have to be in the same place to generate the
   key.
