Declan,

Your readers may be interested in this serious threat to "fair use"
and the transmission of "facts" online.

Craig

=====================================================
Interested organizations/companies are invited to sign onto the
following letter, which addresses concerns that have been raised
regarding a proposed new Treaty concerning access to electronic
databases.  The Treaty is expected to be discussed at the diplomatic
conference in Geneva this December on behalf of the World Intellectual
Property Organization.  The proposed Treaty grants a new property
right to database owners, which does not incorporate a public "fair
use" doctrine, or other traditional copyright conventions.

Recent analyses of the Treaty by Jamie Love of the Consumer Project on
Technology indicates that the Treaty will create a new property right
in facts and other data now in the public domain.  It would, for
example, significantly change the way sports statistics are controlled
and disseminated, and also impact the way that stock prices, weather
data, train schedules, data from AIDS research and other facts are
used and controlled.

Jamie writes:

    The treaty seeks, for the first time, to permit firms to "own"
    facts they gather, and to restrict and control the redissemination
    of those facts.  The new property right would lie outside (and on
    top) of the copyright laws, and create an entirely new and
    untested form of regulation that would radically change the
    public's current rights to use and disseminate facts and
    statistics.  American University Law Professor Peter Jaszi
    recently said the treaty represents "the end of the public
    domain."

Copies of the proposed treaty, a federal register notice
asking for public comment, and independent commentary can be
found at: http://www.public-domain.org/database/database.html

Details and analyses on the Treaty can be found on the Web at:
http://www.public-domain.org, and CPT's "primer" on the treay and
analysis of the impact on sports statistics is available at:
http://www.essential.org/cpt/ip/wipo-sports.html

Copyright experts J.H. Reichman and Pamela Samuelson say  it is the
"least balanced and most potentially anti-competitive intellectual
property rights ever created."

22, so signatures are requested as soon as possible.

Dear Commisioner Lehman:

We, the undersigned organizations, are writing to express our concern
over the "Draft Treaty in Respect to Databases" to be discussed at the
diplomatic conference in Geneva this December on behalf of the World
Intellectual Property Organization (the "Treaty").  The proposed
Treaty grants a new sui generis property right, which does not
incorporate a public "fair use" doctrine, or other traditional
copyright conventions.

If enacted as proposed,  the Treaty will do violence to the
long-established practice in the academic and scientific communities
of sharing information for educational and research purposes and will
commercialize certain information that is and has always been freely
available.

Section 1.03 of the proposed Treaty claims that current technology
allows databases to be reproduced at "practically no cost."  This is
not true.  An online database is a complex system with much underlying
structure that the user never sees.  Accessing or copying large
portions of the database at minimal or no cost is simply not feasible.
But, the proposed Treaty would make the use of databases by the public
or scientific and research communities even more prohibitive by
permitting database owners or vendors to arbitrarily determine what
portion of a database can be extracted, used, or reused.

Section 1.04 of the proposed Treaty argues that the originality
requirement of U.S. Copyright law does not provide sufficient
protection for database producers.  This statement is curious in light
of a long U.S. legal tradition protecting free speech and authorship
on the grounds that facts cannot be copyrighted or otherwise removed
from the public domain.  By creating a new property right for facts,
the Treaty will impose regulations on the use of facts -- an idea that
flies in the face of American history and values.  The twin dangers
are that we will now have to pay to buy collections of "facts" in the
public domain, which we did not have to pay for before and that
monopolies will be sanctioned and created by the Treaty. In other
words, the Treaty strikes down "fair use" and extends sui generis
protections to public and private collections.

Section 1.04 becomes increasingly incomprehensible in light of the
Section 10.05 proposal that "Contracting Parties may design the exact
field of application of the provisions envisaged in this Article
taking into consideration the need to avoid legislation that would
impede lawful practices and the lawful use of subject matter that is
in the public domain."  In order to implement the spirit of Section
10.05, Section 1.04 and its progeny must be discarded.

Consider the numerous categories of public information for which only
one practical and/or cost effective information source exists.  The
practical result of the Treaty will be to create commercial monopolies
on these public information sources.  Examples include telephone
directory information, weather data, "official" sports statistics,
government data administered under private contracts (such as the
Official Airline Guide data) and other similar public information.

It is shocking that the United States Government is seriously
considering supporting a proposal that will operate to maximize
profits to a small number of database vendors at the expense of the
public at large without first undertaking a careful domestic review of
these concerns.  We urge you to examine this issue through
Congressional hearings and other meaningful public discussion.

Sincerely,
Marcy J. Gordon, Esq.

     The common law action of trespass to real property served to
     establish and preserve the very notion of "property" in
     land. Many of the words used to describe Web sites have a
     basis in real property: the word "site" itself is one, as
     are such expressions as "home" pages, "visiting" Web sites,
     "traveling" to a site and the like. This usage suggests that
     the trespass action might appropriately be applied to Web
     sites as well. The question is not merely academic, for the
     "obvious" protections-technology and copyright law-may not
     work. That analogies to real property trespass *can* be made
     does not suggest, however, that they *should* be made. The
     fundamental issue is whether the treatment of Web sites as
     property makes sense in light of the justifications for the
     institution of property generally. Four strands of property
     theory-Locke's natural rights, Bentham's utilitarianism,
     Hardin's "tragedy of the commons," and Radin's "property as
     personhood"-turn out to yield strong justifications for
     treating Web sites as property and hence for the application
     to them of the common law of trespass.

     Global computer-based communications cut across territorial
     borders, creating a new realm of human activity and
     undermining the feasibility--and legitimacy--of applying
     laws based on geographic boundaries.  While these electronic
     communications play havoc with geographic boundaries, a new
     boundary, made up of the screens and passwords that separate
     the virtual world from the "real world" of atoms, emerges.
     This new boundary defines a distinct Cyberspace that needs
     and can create new law and legal institutions of its own.
     Territorially-based law-making and law-enforcing authorities
     find this new environment deeply threatening. But
     established territorial authorities may yet learn to defer
     to the self-regulatory efforts of Cyberspace participants
     who care most deeply about this new digital trade in ideas,
     information, and services.  Separated from doctrine tied to
     territorial jurisdictions, new rules will emerge, in a
     variety of on-line spaces, to govern a wide range of new
     phenomena that have no clear parallel in the nonvirtual
     world.  These new rules will play the role of law by
     defining legal personhood and property, resolving disputes,
     and crystallizing a collective conversation about core
     values.

     The article describes the role of "Certification
     Authorities" (CAs) in the emerging field of electronic
     commerce.  CAs issue certificates to participants in
     electronic commerce that provide indicia of identity or
     authority, or supply a transactional timestamp. Several
     states, including California, Utah, Washington, Florida,
     Georgia, and New Mexico, have passed ,or are considering,
     legislation to regulate CAs; the article seeks to inform
     this process by examining the law applicable to the issuance
     of digital certificates absent specific legislation.  As
     part of an effort to identify legal problems CAs are likely
     to engender, the article examines a CA's potential liability
     if a customer tricks a CA into issuing a false identity
     credential.  Among the issues discussed are the size of the
     class of foreseeable relying parties and whether the CA
     produces a "good" or a "service" or a hybrid of the two
     under Article 2 of the U.C.C.  The article concludes with a
     survey of the major arguments for and against regulation of
     CAs, and cautions against over-hasty grants of blanket
     immunity of CAs against liability for their own negligence.

     Electronic commerce brings questions about how to sign, or
     evidence legal approval of, electronic documents.  Evidence
     that a person approved a particular electronic document
     might be gathered many different ways.  The article
     evaluates two ways, one using public-key cryptography and
     the other using pen biometrics.  It compares the philosophy
     for mananaging risk in the Utah Digital Signature Act with
     that behind a signature technology known as PenOp.

     all aspects of the regulation of cyberspace, whether that
     regulation is through law, social norms, or the
     architecture of the network. The approach of the Journal
     is inter-disciplinary: We will abstract papers in law and
     in other related social science disciplines that raise
     issues related to the regulation of cyberspace.

     Comments and suggestions about CYBERLAW are welcome.
     Please send them to the editor at:

                   MAILTO:Larry_Lessig@SSRN.Com


     CYBERLAW is the seventh internet-based journal of abstracts
     published by the Legal Scholarship Network (LSN), a division
     of Social Science Electronic Publishing, Inc. (SSEP).  LSN
     also publishes Law and Economics Abstracts (LEA), Corporate,
     Securities, and Finance Law Abstracts (CSFLA), Bankruptcy,
     Reorganization, and Creditors' Rights Abstracts (BRCRA), Tax
     Law and Policy Abstracts (TLPA), Criminal Law and Procedure
     (CLPA) and Constitutional Law (CONLAW).  LSN plans
     additional journals in other major fields of law, including
     environmental law and policy, intellectual property law, and
     civil procedure.

     LSN is co-directed by Ronald J. Gilson and A. Mitchell
     Polinsky.  Gilson is the Charles J. Meyers Professor of
     Law and Business at Stanford Law School, and the Marc
     and Eva Stern Professor of Law and Business at Columbia
     University School of Law.  Polinsky is the Josephine
     Scott Crocker Professor of Law and Economics and Director
     of the John M. Olin Program in Law and Economics at
     Stanford Law School.  Professors Gilson and Polinsky also
     are the editors of LEA.
