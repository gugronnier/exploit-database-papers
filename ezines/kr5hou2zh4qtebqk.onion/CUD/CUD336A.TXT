Subject: Intro to Biblio and ResourcesModerators' Corner

We continually receive requests for information about studies, 'zines
and people doing research on cyber issues.  The number of works
appearing in the past two years has dramatically increased. Below is a
select bibliography of some of the oft-cited works. We tried to be
representative rather than inclusive, and selected articles, stories,
or publications that include references to other works or that are
considered classics and must be read to understand the CU. Some
readers may questions the selection or why we excluded particular
items in favor of others. If any glaring omissions occur, send over
your choices and we will add a supplement in a few weeks.
