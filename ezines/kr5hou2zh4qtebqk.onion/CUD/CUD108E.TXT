%Eds. note: Ruth Hanschka sent the following across the Computer Mediated
Communications bitnet hotline, and said she didn't mind if we reprinted it.
She's graduating and off to make her fortune, so we thought we'd send her
off with the symbolic closing of CuD 1.08 with her list.

From:         RHANSCHKA@HARTFORD
Subject:      SE-communication on BBoards - or While I've got it...

These are two messages concerning symbols used to express emotion in
computer-mediated communication. One has a few additions of my own, the
other is as I received it. I am posting it partly because I am soon to lose
my access to the school computer, and thus to all nets. A second reason is
that I believe other people would like to see these. My apologies to those
who have read them before.

"In printed communications (in this case bulletin boards), it is tough to
get the idea across that you are being sarcastic etc.  Scott Fahlman, with
the help of other participants on FIDONET, might just have the answer..."
This appears at the top of the original.  There are probably more of them
by this time, but I do not have them.  The original notice asks FIDONET
contributors to send more in.  My copy of this came from a photocopy of a
printout in the University of Hartford Computer Resource Library, so blame
them :-') not me.

And now the additions.  These came from a VAX discussion line called
these really were [:-|].

 ((((((((( forwarded by Bob Roberts - bsa018@nmsuvm1  )))))))))))
Here is the canonical list of emoticons. I make no claims as to be the
creator of them; they were gleaned from lists that were sent, lifted from
others' lists, cribbed from postings and .signature files. I am just a
librarian who keeps track of them all.

emoticon: a figure created with the symbols on a keyboard that
          is read with the head tilted to the left. Used to convey
          the spirit in which a line of text was typed.
