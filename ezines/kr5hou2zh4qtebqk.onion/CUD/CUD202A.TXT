  1) CRAIG NEIDORF DEFENSE FUND

++++++++++++++++++
Craig Neidorf's Defense Fund
++++++++++++++++++

Craig Neidorf's legal expense still linger near six figures. We urge
readers to consider sending a few dollars, even if it's just a token
amount. Cases such as Craig's and Len Rose's affect us all, and even a
couple of dollars would help.

Those interested in contributing the Craig Neidorf's defense fund to help
reduce his legal costs should do so soon.  Checks should be made out to the
law firm of KATTEN, MUCHIN AND ZAVIS, and sent directly to his defense
attorney:

       Sheldon Zenner
       c/o Katten, Muchin and Zavis
       525 W. Monroe, Suite 1600
       Chicago, IL  60606

Len Rose has been hit especially hard by legal expenses, and lost virtually
everything he has, including his house and a car to pay his first attorney.
Len is now relying on a public defender, but hopes to retain one more
specialized in computer cases.  There has been talk of a defense fund for
him also, and we'll provide more details if it comes about.

It's easy to sit back and remain apathetic if we don't perceive the issues
to affect us directly, but in both cases the issues of telecommunication
law affect all modem users. In Len's case, the definition of "telepiracy"
could be expanded in such a way that people sending copies of any copyright
program could be subject to prosecution. Those who were on the PHRACK
mailing list, or who downloaded it regularly should be especially
concerned.
