 ATLANTA SENTENCING FOR COMPUTER CRIMES
 ATLANTA, GEORGIA, U.S.A., 1990 NOV 19 (NB) -- Robert J. Riggs,
 Adam E. Grant and Franklin Darden, who pleaded guilty in July to various
 charges relating to computer break-ins to systems of BellSouth, have been
 sentenced by U.S. District Judge Owen Forrester to prison sentences and
 ordered to make financial restitution of $233,000 to BellSouth.  Riggs,
 who had pleaded guilty to one conspiracy count and could have received a
 maximum sentence of five years in prison and a $200,000 fine, was
 sentenced to a 21-month prison term and was ordered to begin serving the
 sentence on February 15th. Darden, who faced similar penalties, received
 14 months as did Grant. Grant had pleaded guilty to possessing 15 or more
 BellSouth access devices with the intent to defraud and faced a maximum
 penalty of 10 years in prison and a $250,000 fine. In sentencing Grant and
 Darden, Judge Forrester stipulated that seven months of their sentences
 may be served in a halfway house. Grant and Darden are scheduled to report
 for confinement on January 4th.

 Craig Neidorf, who had been indicted for publishing an electronic
 document which Riggs admitting copying from BellSouth's files, expressed
 surprise at the sentence, telling Newsbytes "The sentence seems severe
 when one considers the lesser sentence given to Robert Morris who
 disrupted thousands of computers and caused untold financial expense to
 those who had to undo the damage that he caused. I am not saying that
 Morris should have received a harsher penalty; I'm saying rather that the
 Atlanta sentences seem disproportionate. I don't know much about all of the
 Atlanta charges but the testimony concerning them at my case did not
 indicate that there had been great financial damage to anyone because of
 the actions of these three."

 Neidorf also questioned the determination of damages in the case, saying
 "I hope that the damages claimed by BellSouth have been well scruitinized
 by the government. You may remember that, before the charges against me
 were dismissed, BellSouth had claimed that the value of the document in
 question was over $70,000. It turned out that the document was available
 in print for under $20. Riggs, Darden and Grant had already pleaded guilty
 when this gross overstatement came out. I hope, for justice's sake, that
 the restitution awarded actually relates to substantiated damages."

 Kent Alexander, Assistant U.S. Attorney, told Newsbytes that he "is
 comfortable with the method under which the damages were determined." He
 also clarified the order for restitution, saying that Riggs, Darden and
 Grant are jointly responsible for the $233,000 and that each of them is
 individually liable for the entire amount should the others default in
 payment.

 Alexander had, in July, told Newsbytes that the plea agreement entered
 into by the defendants "allows the United States Attorney's office to, in
 return for substantial assistance from the defendants, to ask for a
 downward departure from the sentencing guidelines. The substantial
 assistance referred to includes debriefing by the Secret Service and
 truthful testimony in other related computer cases." Alexander confirmed,
 in his current comments to Newsbytes, that the sentences given were, in
 fact, downward departures from the sentencing guidelines.

 New York State Police Senior Investigator Donald Delaney, who has been at
 the forefront of New York State investigations into computer crime,
 commented on the sentencing to Newsbytes, saying "I think that the
 sentence is significant and appropriate given the severity of the crimes.
 I hope that this sends a message to others engaged in telecommunications
 fraud that such actions can result in actual jail terms."

 ATLANTA SENTENCING DESIGNED TO "SEND MESSAGE"
 ATLANTA, GEORGIA, U.S.A., 1990 NOV 20 (NB) -- In response to questions by
 Newsbytes concerning the rationale underlying the sentences received by
 Robert J. Riggs, Adam E. Grant and Franklin E. Darden, Jr.  on November
 16th for activities involving illegal access to computer systems of
 BellSouth, Assistant United States Attorney for the Northern District of
 Georgia Kent B. Alexander has released the "Government's Sentencing
 Memorandum And S.G. & 5K1.1 Motion".  This 21 page document, prepared by
 Joe D. Whitney, United States Attorney for the Northern District of
 Georgia, and Alexander and sent to United States District Court Judge J.
 Owen Forrester, puts forth the factors which the prosecuting attorneys
 wish the judge to consider in determining sentence.

 The memorandum states "Although the government is going to recommend a
 downward departure from the Sentencing Guidelines, the three defendants
 are clearly criminals who have caused a significant amount of damage and
 should be punished accordingly. Moreover, the computer hacker world is
 watching this case very closely, and the Court should send a message that
 illegal computer activities will not be tolerated" (The word "hacker" is
 footnoted and explained by saying "The government uses the term 'hacker'
 to describe a person who uses computers for criminal activity. The Court
 should note, however, that the term 'hacker' can also be used to describe
 legitimate computer users. At one time all computer users were known as
 'hackers' and some computer users still identify themselves as
 'hackers'.").

 In explaining the gravity of the crimes, the memorandum states  "In all,
 they stole approximately $233,800 worth of logins/passwords and connect
 addresses (i.e. access information) from BellSouth.  BellSouth spent
 approximately $1.5 million in identifying the intruders into their system
 and has since spent roughly $3 million  more to further secure their
 network."

 In explaining the perceived need to send a message to the  "hacker
 community", the memorandum points out that the last  federally prosecuted
 adult criminal hacker, Robert Morris,  Jr. received probation and that
 that sentence was followed  very closely by 'hackers' throughout the
 nation.  The  memorandum states "Any sentence that does not include
 incarceration would send the wrong message to the hacking  community; that
 is, that breaking into computer systems is  not really a crime."

 The document also states that "All three defendants have  provided
 significant cooperation that has fueled further  investigation into the
 activities of a number of computer  hackers throughout the country."
 Because of this  cooperation, the "government moves for this Court to make
 a  downward departure pursuant to S.G. 5k1.1 in the amount of three levels
 for defendants Grant and Darden and two levels  for defendant Riggs." The
 memorandum then details the  cooperation of each of these defendants in
 cases involving  Craig Neidorf in Chicago and an unnamed "fellow Legion of
 Doom member" in Detroit. The memorandum also explains why a  lesser
 departure is recommended for Riggs - "Defendant Riggs strikes the
 undersigned counsel as an unusually quiet  and pensive person. Throughout
 the investigation, he has  been cooperative, but because of his nature, he
 sometimes  comes across as uninterested and evasive. The bottom line  is
 that he provided helpful information that furthered  several
 investigations around the country, though his  assistance was not as
 substantial as that of Grant and  Darden; hence the recommendation of only
 a two-level  departure." An earlier conviction for Riggs related to
 computer fraud was also mentioned.

 In the actual sentencing by Judge Forrester, Grant and  Darden received 14
 months incarceration of which 7 will be  in a half-way house  while Riggs
 received 21 months incarceration . Additionally, they were directed to
 make  restitution payments to BellSouth of $233,000.

 In a conversation with Newsbytes, the aforementioned Craig Neidorf
 questioned the determination of damages in the case, saying "I hope that
 the damages claimed by BellSouth have been well scrutinized by the
 government. You may remember that, before the charges against me were
 dismissed, BellSouth had claimed that the value of the document in
 question was over $70,000. It turned out that the document was available
 in print for under $20. Riggs, Darden and Grant had already pleaded guilty
 when this gross overstatement came out. I hope, for justice's sake, that
 the restitution awarded actually relates to substantiated damages." An
 examination of the sentencing memorandum finds that the E911 file, "the
 subject of the Chicago indictment" was estimated by Bob Kibler of
 BellSouth Security to be valued, based on R&D costs, at $24,639.

 Kent Alexander, Assistant U.S. Attorney, told Newsbytes that he "is
 comfortable with the method under which the damages were determined." He
 also clarified the order for restitution, saying that Riggs, Darden and
 Grant are jointly responsible for the $233,000 and that each of them is
 individually liable for the entire amount should the others default in
 payment.

 The Department of Justice release also stated "The United  States Attorney
 commented that most computer users engage  in legal and constructive
 activities. Criminal hackers,  however, who break into computer systems of
 others, are  breaking the law and will be prosecuted accordingly."
