Subject: Robert Miles - "computer wizard"

*Very* interesting article "The FBI comes rapping...".
But, on Robert Miles being a "computer wizard", well, in his own words:

"...in a computer journal, called PC/Computing, a nationwide publication,
out of Cambridge, Mass., there is an article by some lying idiot...in which
he calls me a computer wizard, and states that I was a defendant in the Berg
case in Denver. Sorry, about that old boy. I was never tried in Denver. The
friends who were, will be amazed to learn that I was a co-defendant in that
trial. And as for me being a 'computer wizard', wow, did that crack up
Dotty... I can hardly fix the toaster. ... So, what you read in this
article.... ha! ... Yesterday, ah couldn't spell one, now ah is one.....
.....a real live Computer Wizard."

"..." is where I have deleted irrelevant sections. "...." and "....." were
in the original text.

Not that this proves much, -- I trust Miles about as much as I trust the
media --  but in the pictures I've seen of him, he certainly doesn't *look*
like a techie type.

Has CuD been intentionally backing off their earlier defense of civil
liberties? Recent issues lack the spark of earlier ones.  What's happening
with Len Rose? Why aren't there more articles on follow-ups to
investigations, Ripco, Secret Service activities, searches, Steve Jackson
Games, and all the issues that CuD started with? I enjoy the news and some
of the articles, but I subscribed because of you guys seemed about the only
ones willing to take a strong stand and speak out. Whatever happened with
the informant thing? Another issue I'd like to see raised is all the
anonymous posts in CuD and on the nets.  In one issue you said you publish
anonymously when people are afraid of reprisals. This reminds me of
McCarthyism, where people were afraid to speak out for fear of being
listed. Maybe the fear that the nets are monitored by vindictive types
(and there are a few of these on comp.org.eff.talk) or law enforcement.
Plus the fact that it's so easy to send hate mail and otherwise harass on
the nets. If you're being pressured or if people are complaining about you
being too pro-hacker or too radical, would you publish it, or would you
just allow yourselves to be co-opted? I'd personally like to see more fire
in between the other material.

(Editors' response: No, we haven't been pressured or in any way or
"encouraged" to change our position. Quite the opposite. Yes, we may have
become less strident--although there would be a few who would claim
otherwise. We have been advised to refrain from publishing anything
substantive about on-going cases by those involved in them for fear of
putting the principles at risk or of subverting legal strategies responding
to what many see as abuses of authority.  We're willing to publish articles
that are both radical and conservative, and we generally have not had many
articles from either extreme.  However, we do have two special issues
planned (tentatively 3.09 and 3.10) on government surveillance and what
people in the CU can do about it.
