Has anyone seen the announcement for the Ides of March computer conference?

The reason it caught my attention is that one of the speakers is Gail
Thackery.

My question is: why?

Why is Gail speaking at a computer conference?  What does she know about
computers?

She probably does know a lot about prosecution, I don't doubt her ability
as a lawyer, but what does she know about computer crime specifically?

Ok.  We all know what she was involved in, but that just proves my point
further.  Those aren't exactly what you would call "clean" busts.  And with
Sundevil, there weren't even that many (any?) busts made.

It doesn't say much for her ability to prosecute computer crime.

What exactly is she going to speak about?  I can't figure that out.  Maybe
she's going to explain what KERMIT is or something.  Though, she should
explain that to law enforcement officials.

See, that's where I have this problem.  Here we have an individual speaking
at an industry conference, and this individual is not in the industry.  She
does not affect the industry except in destructive ways (if you want a list
on how it's been destructive, E-mail me.  It's too long for here).

And with her being on the Well and all, and now there's a rumor of her
getting some type of "honor" with Barlow at the Comps, Sec, and Priv
conference, I'm beginning to wonder how one becomes an authority on
computers.

Why not honor some beat cops who find some stolen PC's?  They have about as
much to do with computer crime and how it relates to the industry as Gail.

This is ridiculous.  Does anyone else see politics or something coming into
play here or is it just me?

If what law enforcement says is true, that most computer crime goes
unreported since companies don't want to publicly admit that they have
security problems, then aren't the companies bigger authorities on computer
crime than lawyers and cops and feds and what have you?

What can Gail tell an employee of AT&T or IBM or DEC or Maxis or Sierra or
whoever that they don't already know, and probably know better?  She can't
tell them how systems are broken into.  She can't tell them about a "ring"
of hackers/phreaks since there is no such animal.  She probably can't even
tell them what a macro is.

Just what we need.  The few decent people in the industry jumping in bed
with fascists.  Ha!  I'm conservative and a capitalist and all that, but I
still wouldn't throw what few morals I have out the door for an extra buck
or my name in lights or anything.

See, I agree with companies when they say that they don't want some punks
breaking into their computers.  I can even agree with arresting people who
do.  What I can't agree with is persecuting people (ala Len Rose) or
widespread terror tactics (ala Sundevil).  If I were a hacker I'd rather
have AT&T's internal security knocking at my door rather than Gail & Co.
seeing what they've done to people.

The only reason I can see for Gail to be there is to bury the hatchet.
Well, when you bury the hatchet with people who are experts at wielding
one, you can bet it'll end up in your back in the end.

Flames gratefully accepted.

Here in Northern California we have a free computer magazine called
Microtimes.  It is in a 10 1/2 x 13" format computer mag that has picked up
quite a bit of popularity over the last couple of years.  It used to be
just a place to read advertisements, but these days it has occasional
interesting articles, too.

The latest issue has a cover suite on computer security.  From the table of
contents:

*Computer Crime:  Beyond The Headlines
An Interview With Dorothy Denning*
by John Perry Barlow
	Computer security expert Denning and self-proclaimed
	cognitive dissident Barlow discuss system break-ins,
	hacker culture, recent court cases, and long-term
	issues.

*Why Defend Hackers?*
by Mitch Kapor
	Lotus founder and Electronic Frontier Foundation
	chairman Kapor explains what the fledgling EFF
	organization is up to, and why.

*Realizable Fantasies*

TEN FULL REGISTRATION SCHOLARSHIPS FOR COMPUTERS, FREEDOM & PRIVACY CONF
John Gilmore of Cygnus Support has offered (and prepaid) ten full
Registration Scholarships for college and university students wishing to
attend the four-day First Conference on Computers, Freedom & Privacy, March
25-28, 1991, at the SFO Marriott near the San Francisco International
Airport in Burlingame, California.

Students wishing to apply for one of these full-paid registrations
should send a *one*-page-only request, to arrive no later than March 10th.
They should concisely provide the following information in that one page:

  1.  Personal information (name, address, phones, possible fax#, etc.)
  2.  Current college or university, major, areas of special interest,
grad/undergrad status and expected graduation date.  We are especially
seeking students majoring in law, law enforcement, political science,
journalism, business, information science and related disciplines.
  3.  A specific statement that they are certain they can arrange all needed
travel and accomodations for the four-day event.
  4.  A specific statement that they will attend the full four days of the
event from Monday, 9am, to Thursday, 5:30pm, including the Tuesday and
Wednesday dinner sessions (also prepaid).
  5.  A paragraph stating why they are interested in attending the event.
  6.  A paragraph stating what they might, or hope to, do with information
and insights gleaned from this Conference.

The one-page letter or fax should arrive no later than March 10th, sent to:
  John Gilmore Liberty Scholarships                     (fax is fine)

CFP Conference, 345 Swett Road, Woodside CA 94062; fax/415-851-2814 The ten
recipients will be notified no later than March 15th, but may be notified
much earlier.  (Due to the very tight time constraints, we reserve the
right to grant awards to especially deserving applicants before the March
10th deadline.)

P.S. -- MAKE HOTEL RESERVATIONS *SOON*!
If you are planning on attending the CFP Conference, but have not yet made
your reservations at the Marriott (800-228-9290 #3), you should do so ASAP,
if you wish to be assured the special $99 Conference discount rate.  As we
approach the March 25th Conference opening, the Marriott is permitted to
release unbooked rooms -- which means they either won't be available, or
may require much higher rates (rack rates are $140).

  Use it or loose it!  :-)

--Jim Warren, CFP Conference Chair

Network Information Access is a text magazine, that relates to the
underground telecom industry.  Articles range from Unix, Vax, and such
systems.  Covering everything from computer crime down to the latest
computer bug that is floating around.

If you have ever read Phrack, LOD, PHUN, and magazines of that type of
nature, we are somewhat like that.  But more/less reframed then those.

Currently we have 69 issues out, around the middle/end of each month we
will mail off the next current issue.  All BACK ISSUES can be found at the
CUD (Computer Underground Digest) archive site, please refer to CUD for
more information or subscribe to their echo at comp.alt.society.cu-digest.

There is no actual "deadline" for articles, reports or papers to be
submitted, so if you HAVE anything, or are WORKING on something, please
think of us first.  If you have anything to send to NIA, send the completed
work, as YOU WANT it to appear in our newsletter and after reviewing your
article, checking to see if we can include it in our NEXT mailing it will
go out when our next issue is released.  All articles are to be sent to
elisem@nuchat.sccsi.com.

All addresses sent to NIA to be added to our mailing list is kept in the
stricket confidence, we do NOT give out our list, So YOUR ADDRESS is kept
confidential and private, and so as not to have your address flooded w/
hundreds of "Please subscribe to MY newsletter" type mailings.

If an address bounces back as "UNKNOWN" or to such, we will delete that
address off of our list, so if you change your address, make sure you
notify us of the change or you will loose the next issue.

I hope that this explains to you what NIA is and hopefully you'll continue
to read us, pass us around, and heck, recommend us to a friend.
