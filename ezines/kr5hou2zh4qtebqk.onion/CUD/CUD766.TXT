Computer Users Fight Back:

        CINCINNATI ELECTRONIC BULLETIN BOARD SYSTEM USERS
       FILE CLASS ACTION LAWSUIT AGAINST SHERIFF SIMON LEIS

  Seven subscribers to a Cincinnati electronic bulletin board system filed
a class action lawsuit today in federal court against Sheriff Simon L Leis,
Jr., and other law enforcement officials.  On June 16, 1995, members of the
Hamilton County Computer Crimes Task Force raided the offices of the
Cincinnati Computer Connection BBS and seized the entire computer system,
including all the private electronic mail of the subscribers.  This is the
first user class action challenging a government seizure of computer
material.

  According to the search warrant used to justify the raid, the Task Force
was seeking 45 computer image files on a system that contained hundreds of
thousands of public and private messages.

  The seven subscribers represent a class of thousands of users of the
Cincinnati Computer Connection electronic bulletin board.  The lead
plaintiff is Steve Guest, a 36-year old computer system analyst who runs
his own business, in large part using the Cincinnati Computer Connection
BBS.  Other plaintiffs include Denise and Ben Kelley, active bulletin board
users and grandparents of seven; Nelda Sturgill, a registered nurse who
used the bulletin board to keep up with medical news and to swap recipes;
and Randy Bowling, who suffers from a speech impediment caused by a head
injury, who used CCC BBS as his primary way to communicate and to study
computer science.

  "The faces of the CCC subscribers were the faces of Greater Cincinnati -
working men and women, retirees, mothers, fathers, grandparents and
children, Republicans, Democrats and Independents," the lawsuit alleges.
The users of the system claim that the wholesale seizure of the computer
bulletin board system violated their constitutional right to free speech
and association and that the seizure of their private e-mail violated their
right to privacy and federal law.

  "The Task Force used a drift net to troll for a tiny amount of supposed
'computer porn,'" said Cincinnati civil rights lawyer Scott T. Greenwood,
who represents the plaintiffs.  "In the process, they netted an enormous
amount of entirely irrelevant material, and shut down a
constitutionally-protected forum for speech and association."

  "We believe that the law prohibits the indiscriminate seizure of private
electronic communications," said Peter D. Kennedy, an Austin, Texas
attorney who also represents the plaintiffs, and who represented Steve
Jackson Games when that company sued the U.S. Secret Service for illegally
seizing its electronic bulletin board system in 1990.  "It is a fundamental
principle of law that, even during legitimate investigations, the
government must limit its searches and seizures to things related to the
crime under investigation.  Here, the Task Force took everything, including
thousands of innocent persons' private mail and public notices."

  Greenwood added, "Whether the sheriff and the computer 'net police' like
it or not, the Bill of Rights is not optional just because they don't like
it or understand it.  Shutting down a computer system and seizing people's
private communications makes a mockery of the First Amendment."

  The lawsuit claims that Sheriff Leis and the Task Force violated the
First Amendment, the Fourth Amendment, several provisions of the federal
Electronic Communications Privacy Act of 1986,  and Ohio common law privacy
rights, and seeks actual damages, statutory damages, and punitive damages
on behalf of the seven plaintiffs and the entire class.

 I.  INTRODUCTION

 1.      The Plaintiffs bring this lawsuit on behalf of themselves and the
 thousands of subscribers to the Cincinnati Computer Connection electronic
 bulletin board system, in order to redress the violation of their civil
 rights by Hamilton County Sheriff Simon L. Leis, Jr. and the other
 Defendants.
 2.      On June 16, 1995, the Hamilton County Regional Computer Task Force
 (the "Task Force") raided at least five electronic bulletin board systems
 in the Cincinnati area, in a search for allegedly obscene materials.
 3.      During these raids, the Task Force seized the entire computer
 network comprising the Cincinnati Computer Connection BBS, a computer
 bulletin board service with thousands of subscribers in Southern Ohio,
 Northern Kentucky, and beyond.  Robert Emerson owns and operates the
 Cincinnati Computer Connection BBS.  The target of the raid was some 45
 computer image files allegedly stored on the Cincinnati Computer Connection
 BBS.  According to the search warrant, the Task Force already had obtained
 copies of these image files from the Cincinnati Computer Connection BBS.
 4.      In pursuit of these 45 image files,  the Sheriff and Task Force
 raided and seized the entire bulletin board system.  In the process,
 Sheriff Leis and his Task Force seized the private electronic mail and
 communications of thousands of entirely innocent subscribers, they shut
 down an active, thriving, electronic community of average citizens, and
 they denied thousands of people access to their friends, neighbors, and
 business associates.
 5.      The named Plaintiffs bring this lawsuit on behalf of themselves and
 the thousands of subscribers to the Cincinnati Computer Connection and all
 those whose electronic communications were seized and intercepted during
 the raid, in order to remedy this violation of their civil rights
 guaranteed by the First Amendment, the Fourth Amendment, the Fourteenth
 Amendment, the Ohio Constitution, the Electronic Communications Privacy Act
 of 1986 (18 U.S.C. 2510 et seq. and 2701 et seq.) and Ohio common law.


 II.  JURISDICTION

 6.      This action seeks to enforce rights guaranteed by the Constitution
 and laws of the United States and is brought pursuant to 42 U.S.C. 1983
 and 1985.  Jurisdiction is based upon 28 U.S.C. 1331 and 1343(3). The
 substantive federal claims are brought pursuant to 42 U.S.C.  1983 and
 1985, and 18 U.S.C. 2707 and 2520.  Declaratory relief is sought pursuant
 to 28 U.S.C. 2201-2202.  Authority to hear the pendent state claims is
 conferred by the Court's supplemental jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. 1367.
 This action does not raise novel or complex issues of state law, and the
 state law claims do not predominate over the federal law claims.
 7.      Venue is proper in the Southern District of Ohio, Western Division,
 under 28 U.S.C. 1391(b), because at least one Defendant resides in this
 District and Division and because a substantial part of the events or
 omissions giving rise to the claims occurred within this District and
 Division.


 III.  PARTIES


 A.      PLAINTIFFS
 8.      PLAINTIFF STEVEN GUEST is a thirty-six year old resident of
 Clermont County, Ohio.  Mr. Guest is a computer consultant who uses the
 Cincinnati Computer Connection BBS to send and receive electronic
 communications, to conduct his consulting business, to exchange files with
 his business partners, to access shareware, and otherwise to engage in
 expressive and associational activity.
 9.      PLAINTIFF DENISE KELLEY is a sixty-nine year old resident of
 Hamilton County, Ohio.  She is employed by the Hamilton County Department
 of Human Services as an investigation coordinator and serves as the chief
 union steward for AFSCME Local 1768.  Mrs. Kelley, mother of three and
 grandmother of seven, uses the Cincinnati Computer Connection BBS for
 political discussion, to download shareware files, to play some games, to
 send and receive electronic mail communications across the Internet, to
 "chat" with users, to write stories in an on-line conference, and otherwise
 to engage in expressive and associational activity.
 10.     PLAINTIFF BEN S. KELLEY is Mrs. Kelley's husband, a seventy-six
 year old retired machinist who resides in Hamilton County, Ohio.  Mr.
 Kelley, father of three and grandfather of seven, uses the Cincinnati
 Computer Connection BBS to send and receive electronic communications, play
 games, to read the discussions going on in various conferences, and
 otherwise to engage in expressive and associational activity.
 11.     PLAINTIFF NELDA STURGILL is a registered nurse in a local hospital
 who resides in Hamilton County.  In her thirties, Ms. Sturgill uses the
 Cincinnati Computer Connection BBS to send and receive electronic
 communications across the Internet, to access shareware programs, to keep
 abreast of information through the use of the Usenet newsgroups, and
 otherwise to engage in expressive and associational activity.  Ms. Sturgill
 particularly participates in the health-related conferences newsgroups, and
 has exchanged recipes and ideas with people from Australia, England and the
 United States.
 12.     PLAINTIFF DEBORAH CUMMINGS is a resident of Kenton County,
 Kentucky.  Ms. Cummings uses the Cincinnati Computer Connection BBS to send
 and receive electronic communications, to conduct her business, and to
 otherwise engage in expressive and associational activity.
 13.     PLAINTIFF RANDY BOWLING is a resident of Butler County, Ohio.  Mr.
 Bowling suffers from a head injury that makes speaking very difficult.
 Mr. Bowling uses the Cincinnati Computer Connection BBS to send and receive
 electronic communications, to supplement his limited ability to speak, and
 to discuss his head injury and therapy, and to engage in the majority of
 his expressive and associational activity.  Mr. Bowling also uses the
 Cincinnati Computer Connection BBS to facilitate his current study of
 computer systems.
 14.     PLAINTIFF RICHARD KRAMER is a retired insurance agent who resides
 in Butler County, Ohio.  Mr. Kramer, who uses a wheelchair, uses the
 Cincinnati Computer Connection BBS to send and receive electronic
 communications, to supplement his sometimes restricted access to more
 traditional fora for expressive and associational activity, to access
 file-management and utility shareware, and to study computer systems.
 15.     Each named Plaintiff is a citizen of the United States.
 16.     At all times relevant herein, Plaintiffs were users of the
 Cincinnati Computer Connection BBS.
                 Class Action Allegations
 17.     The named Plaintiffs are proper representatives of a class within
 the meaning of Rule 23(a) and 23(b) (3) of the Federal Rules of Civil
 Procedure.
 18.     The members of the class are so numerous that the joinder of all of
 them is impractical.  Upon information and belief, the class consists of at
 least several thousand persons.  The exact size of the class is unknown
 because the Defendants have seized and failed to return the computer and/or
 documentary records needed to determine the exact number and identity of
 the class members.
 19.     The members of the class should be readily identifiable from
 records seized by the Defendants.
 20.     There are questions of law and fact common to the class; their
 class claims predominate over any individual claims.  Each class member
 shares the same federal and state constitutional protections of their right
 to speak, publish and associate.  Each class member shares the same federal
 and state constitutional right to be free from unreasonable searches and
 seizures.  Each class member shares the same federal and state rights
 protecting the privacy of their electronic communications and subscriber
 records.
 21.     The claims of the named Plaintiffs are typical of the claims of the
 class.  All class members suffered a similar violation of their common
 rights when the Defendants seized and shut down the Cincinnati Computer
 Connection BBS, and, upon information and belief, reviewed their private
 electronic communications and subscriber records.  As alleged in greater
 detail above, the Plaintiffs' uses of the Cincinnati Computer Connection
 BBS typify the uses of the class members generally.
 22.     The named Plaintiffs will fairly and adequately protect the
 interests of the class.  As of June 16, 1995, each named Plaintiff was a
 user of the Cincinnati Computer Connection BBS.  The named Plaintiffs are
 represented by counsel experienced in litigating federal and state civil
 rights lawsuits, including class actions, and who are familiar with the
 technology involved and experienced in litigating computer communications
 cases.  The representative Plaintiffs know of no conflict of interest among
 class members.  Plaintiffs will vigorously prosecute this action.
 23.     The class consists of all persons who, on June 16, 1995, were
 users, subscribers, or customers of the Cincinnati Computer Connection
 electronic bulletin board service, and all persons whose private electronic
 communications were resident on the Cincinnati Computer Connection BBS when
 it was seized by the Defendants, but not including the actual provider of
 that electronic bulletin board service.
 24.     Plaintiffs do not propose class notice at this time, but belief
 that class certification and notice can and should be achieved promptly.

 Plaintiffs by the First, Fourth, and Fourteenth Amendments to the United
 States Constitution, the laws of the United States, and the Constitution
 and laws of the State of Ohio.

 IV.  FACTS

 A.      The Cincinnati Computer Connection Community.
 33.     On June 16, 1995, and for many years before that, the Cincinnati
 Computer Connection ("CCC") was a thriving community.  The bulletin board
 system ("BBS") provided a forum for its users to speak and publish
 privately and publicly, to debate, to associate and recreate, and to
 exchange ideas and information.  On June 16, 1995, the faces of the CCC
 subscribers were the faces of Greater Cincinnati -- working men and women,
 retirees, mothers, fathers, grandparents and children, Republicans,
 Democrats and Independents.  The CCC community even included subscribers
 from around the United States and overseas.
 34.     Many of the subscribers to the CCC BBS have made personal
 acquaintances through the bulletin board community.   Subscribers have held
 dinner get-togethers to meet personally, to socialize, and to discuss
 matters of interest to the BBS community.  These meetings were organized by
 using the BBS itself.
 35.     On June 16, 1995, the CCC community included thousands of users and
 subscribers.  Because the CCC computers and subscriber records remain in
 the hands of the Defendants, the exact number remains unknown.
 36.     At all relevant times, the CCC BBS affected and operated in the
 stream of interstate commerce.

 B.      The Cincinnati Computer Connection BBS.
 37.     Each user or subscriber to the CCC BBS selected a private password,
 which secured the privacy of his or her account.  The subscriber contacted
 the CCC BBS by using his or her personal computer, a modem, and a phone
 line.  The user's computer would call the CCC BBS over a phone line, and
 after "logging in" by using the confidential password, the user was given
 access to the CCC BBS.  Once connected to the BBS, the subscriber could do
 a whole range of things, including:
         i.      Private electronic mail or "e-mail."
 38.     The CCC BBS provided subscribers the ability to send and receive
 private electronic communications, typically known as e-mail.  A subscriber
 could compose private electronic messages either before "logging on" to the
 CCC, or while connected to the bulletin board system.  Just like First
 Class mail, e-mail messages are addressed to a specific person, and are
 confidential.
 39.     E-mail was sent and received in two manners on the CCC BBS.  E-mail
 exchanged between persons who had accounts on the CCC BBS was sent within
 the many conference areas on the BBS (see below).  If the sender designated
 a conference message "confidential," the message remained inaccessible to
 any user except the designated recipient.  The CCC BBS also provided an
 "Internet mail gateway."  This feature allowed subscribers to send and
 receive confidential electronic communications from persons who did not
 have an account on the CCC BBS, but who had an Internet address.  This
 Internet mail gateway allowed the users of the CCC BBS to send confidential
 electronic communications to, and receive them from, tens of millions of
 persons around the world.
 40.     This e-mail was not readily accessible to the public.  The users of
 the CCC BBS, and those who sent electronic mail to the CCC BBS from the
 Internet, had a reasonable expectation of privacy in those communications.
 41.     When Defendant Leis and the other Defendants seized the CCC BBS,
 they seized all of the private electronic communications contained on the
 system, and cut off the subscribers' ability to send and receive e-mail.
         ii.     Conference areas.
 42.     In addition to e-mail, the Cincinnati Computer Connection provided
 its subscribers access to thousands of "conferences."  These conferences,
 like the sections of a library, are the main organizational units of the
 BBS.  Each conference area had a name and a topic.  For example, the CCC
 BBS had conference areas dedicated to writers, game players, and computer
 professionals.  When a subscriber accessed the bulletin board system, he or
 she could "enter" an conference area.  Once in a conference area, the
 subscriber could read all the public messages posted by other visitors to
 the conference, post public reply messages or begin new public discussions
 on new topics.   The user could also send and receive private electronic
 communications within the conference.  The CCC BBS provided literally
 thousands of conferences for its users, including:
                 a.      Local conference areas.
 43.     These conferences were unique to the CCC BBS, and included
 discussions and debates on topics ranging from local and national politics
 to sports and computers.  These conferences were the heart of the local CCC
 community interaction.
                 b.      Private local conference areas.
 44.     The CCC BBS also provided conference areas that were restricted to
 particular users.  These restricted conference areas were used by
 subscribers for confidential business purposes, including exchanging
 confidential information.
                 c.      BBS network conferences.
 45.     On June 16, 1995, the CCC BBS also provided to its users "feeds"
 from networks of similar dial-up bulletin board systems.  These networks
 provided dozens of additional conference areas, and allowed the users of
 the CCC BBS to engage in discussion on topics with users of a whole network
 of BBSs beyond the subscribers to the CCC BBS.
                 d.      Usenet newsgroups.
 46.     The CCC BBS also received, via satellite feed, thousands of
 additional conferences from an Internet network known as Usenet.  Usenet is
 essentially a  bulletin board system for the Internet.  Usenet is organized
 into thousands of separate "newsgroups" where people from all around the
 world can engage in discussion and debate on a huge variety of topics,
 ranging from computer science, philosophy, and law to pop music.  The CCC
 subscribers could read and participate in these newsgroups.
 47.     When Defendant Leis and the other Defendants seized the CCC BBS,
 they seized all of the contents of all of these thousands of conference
 areas, and denied the subscribers to the CCC any access to the conferences.
         iii.    Live "chat."
 48.       The Cincinnati Computer Connection BBS also featured live chat
 "channels."  Similar to CB radio channels, the "chat" function allowed
 subscribers to converse in "real time" with other subscribers who were
 logged into the BBS.  One subscriber could invite another person to chat,
 and the two subscribers could exchange confidential messages by typing them
 in sequence to each other.
 49.     When Defendant Leis and the other Defendants seized the CCC BBS,
 they shut down any chat taking place on the board and seized any captured
 chat file sessions.
         iv.     Games.
 50.     The game areas on the CCC were very popular.  Subscribers could
 play a variety of on-line games against the computer or against other
 subscribers.   Some "games" were more like interactive creative writing,
 with different users of the BBS taking on personas and interacting with
 each other in a fictional world.
 51.     The Defendants' seizure of the bulletin board system of course
 included seizure of all the games, and cut off the subscribers' access to
 the games.
         v.      File transfer.
 52.     The CCC BBS offered its subscribers the ability to "upload"
 computer files from their home computer to the bulletin board system, and
 to "download" computer files from the bulletin board to their home
 computers.  Computer files can consist of anything from computer programs
 and other software, to the text of written material (such as this
 Complaint), to picture files and sound files.  The CCC BBS had an enormous
 library of computer files for its users to access and use.  The Defendants
 seized this entire library of thousands of computer files when they seized
 the 45 allegedly obscene images they were after.
         vi.     The restricted adult file area.
 53.     Among the thousands of conferences on the CCC, there was a single
 conference area dedicated to adult-oriented computer image files.  Access
 to this area was extremely limited.  In order to gain access to this
 conference, a subscriber was required to verify his age and identity in
 person to the CCC system operator, Mr. Emerson.  After verifying the
 subscriber's age, Emerson would configure that user's account to give that
 subscriber access to the adult file area.  Only after a subscriber's age
 and identity was verified, and the subscriber's account given access to the
 adult file area, would the existence of the adult file area even appear on
 the user's screen when logged in to the CCC.  The "menu" of choices
 available to a subscriber who had not been verified and given access would
 not even show that an adult file area existed.
 54.     Even for those with access to the restricted adult file area, the
 adult image files could not be viewed "on-line."  In order to view a file,
 a subscriber with access would have to log onto the BBS, enter the
 restricted adult area, designate a file for downloading, download that file
 to the user's home computer, log off the system, and then run a separate
 computer  program on the home computer that interprets the image and
 displays it on the user's home computer screen.
 55.     The restricted adult file area comprised a very small percentage of
 the material on the CCC BBS -- no more than 3%, and upon information and
 belief far less than that.  The number of users with access to this area
 was also very small -- no more than 3% of the subscribers, and upon
 information and belief far less than that.  Many, if not most, of the CCC
 subscribers had no idea that an adult file area even existed.
 56.     Compared to the Cincinnati Computer Connection as a whole, the
 adult file area was like a tiny, locked, and largely unknown private room
 within a huge, bustling convention center.
 C.      Defendants Obtain A Search Warrant And Go Trolling for Computer
 Porn.
 57.     On or about June 15, 1995, the Defendants applied to the Municipal
 Court of Clermont Count for a search warrant for the premises containing
 the CCC BBS computers.  Municipal Court Judge James A. Shriver signed the
 search warrant at 11:30 p.m. that evening.  Upon information and belief,
 Judge Shriver had never reviewed an application for the search or for the
 seizure of an electronic communication system such as the CCC BBS, and had
 never issued a search warrant for such a system.  The search warrant itself
 listed 45 particular image files, by name and description, that were the
 target of the search.
 58.     The Defendants obtained an order sealing from public scrutiny the
 search warrant affidavit that allegedly justified their application for the
 search warrant.    Plaintiffs have not obtained a copy of the affidavit or
 affidavits that allegedly supported the search warrant.  However, upon
 information and belief, Plaintiffs allege that the Defendants failed to
 inform Judge Shriver of the following material facts:  (1) that the CCC BBS
 was a forum for protected speech, publication and association, and that the
 Defendants intended to shut down that forum and seize all the publications
 contained on that forum; (2) that the CCC BBS contained thousands of
 private electronic communications to and from the subscribers of the CCC
 BBS, and that the Defendants intended to shut down that communication
 system, and seize, intercept and read these private communications; (3)
 that the electronic communications Defendants sought were protected by
 federal and state law from interception, seizure and disclosure; and (4)
 that the Defendants had no probable cause to believe that these private
 communications of the thousands of subscribers to the CCC BBS were relevant
 to any investigation of any alleged criminal activity.
 D.      Defendants Shut Down the Cincinnati Computer Connection BBS and
 Indiscriminately Seize Everything On It.
 59.     On June 16, 1995, purportedly acting under the authority of the
 search warrant signed by Judge Shriver, the Defendants seized the entire
 CCC BBS.  The Defendants made no effort to limit their seizure to materials
 or information related to the alleged offense under investigation; rather,
 they seized the entire system, shutting it down completely.  If not for a
 significant personal financial commitment by Mr. Emerson after the raid,
 the CCC BBS would have been permanently shut down.
 60.     As of the date of this filing, the Defendants have made no effort
 to return to the Plaintiffs or any other user of the CCC BBS their private
 electronic communications, or to assure that such communications reach
 their intended recipients.  Upon information and belief, the Defendants
 have already, or have every intention to, read the private electronic
 communications of the CCC BBS subscribers.
 61.     The Defendants made no effort to limit the scope of their seizure.
 Prior to the raid, the Defendants knew the exact file names of the computer
 image files they were searching for.  In fact, the Defendants had already
 obtained those files prior to the raid.  The Defendants consciously chose
 not to use means at their disposal that would have allowed for a limited
 search and seizure of evidence relevant to the alleged offense.  The
 Defendants consciously refused to use narrower means of obtaining their
 investigative objectives that would have protected the privacy of the
 subscribers' communications and the integrity of their forum.
 62.     The Defendants knew, or should have known, that the CCC BBS was a
 forum for protected speech, publication and communication.  The Defendants
 knew, or should have known, that the CCC BBS contained materials being
 published electronically that were protected by the First Amendment to the
 U.S. Constitution and the Ohio Constitution.  The Defendants knew, or
 should have known, that the  BBS contained the private electronic
 communications of its users, and that such communications were not readily
 accessible to the public.  The Defendants knew, or should have known, that
 the users of the CCC BBS had a reasonable expectation of privacy in their
 electronic communications.
 63.     Reasonable law enforcement officers in the position of the
 Defendants, with the information available to the Defendants, would have
 known that the CCC BBS was a forum for speech, publication and
 communication protected by the First Amendment and the Ohio Constitution,
 and that the electronic communications on the CCC BBS were protected by the
 Fourth Amendment, the Ohio Constitution and federal statutory law from
 search and seizure and interception unless the officers had probable cause
 to believe that those communications were relevant to the law enforcement
 inquiry.

 V.      FIRST CLAIM -   FIRST AMENDMENT
 (FREEDOM OF SPEECH, PRESS, AND ASSOCIATION)

 64.     The allegations in paragraphs 1-63 are incorporated herein by
 reference.
 65.     At all relevant times, the Cincinnati Computer Connection BBS
 published, in electronic form, magazines, periodicals, non-fiction,
 fiction, images and other materials protected by the First Amendment.
 66.     The Cincinnati Computer Connection BBS was a forum for speech,
 publication and association protected by the First and Fourteenth
 Amendments.
 67.     The Plaintiffs and the class members at all relevant times used the
 Cincinnati Computer Connection BBS to exercise their constitutional rights
 to speak, publish and associate.
 68.     The Defendants' search, seizure, and retention of the Cincinnati
 Computer Connection BBS, and the materials contained on the BBS, violated
 the Plaintiffs' and class members' clearly established constitutional
 rights to speak, publish and associate.
 69.     The Defendants' seizure and retention of computer hardware and
 software used by Cincinnati Computer Connection BBS constituted a prior
 restraint on the Plaintiffs' constitutional rights of freedom of speech, of
 the press, and of association.
 70.     Defendants knew or reasonably should have known that their conduct
 violated the Plaintiffs' and the class members' clearly established First
 Amendment rights of freedom of speech, freedom of the press, and freedom of
 association.
 71.     Defendants acted with intent to violate, or with reckless
 indifference to, the Plaintiffs and class members' clearly established
 First Amendment rights to freedom of speech, freedom of the press, and
 freedom of association.
 72.     At all relevant times, Defendants were acting under color of state
 law.
 73.     The Defendants' actions have caused the Plaintiffs and class
 members a real and palpable fear that their future electronic
 communications will be seized and reviewed by law enforcement agents,
 without justification or excuse.  As a result, the Plaintiffs and class
 members have suffered a distinct and actual diminution of their willingness
 to speak, publish and associate freely and openly without fear of
 government intrusion and reprisal.
 74.     As a direct result of Defendants' conduct, the Plaintiffs and class
 members have suffered a distinct and actual restriction on their freedom of
 speech, press and association.
 75.     As a direct result of the Defendants' conduct, the Plaintiffs have
 suffered actual damages, attorneys' fees, and costs.

 VI.     SECOND CLAIM - OHIO CONSTITUTION ARTICLE I, SECTION 11
 (FREEDOM TO SPEAK, WRITE, PUBLISH, AND ASSOCIATE)
 76.     The allegations in paragraphs 1-75 are incorporated herein by
 reference.
 77.     In the same manner that the Defendants' actions violated the

 established right to speak, write, publish, and associate guaranteed by
 Article I, Section 11 of the Constitution of the State of Ohio.
 78.     The Defendants' actions have caused the Plaintiffs and class
 members a real and palpable fear that their future electronic
 communications and publications will be seized and reviewed by law
 enforcement agents, without justification or excuse.  As a result, the
 Plaintiffs and class members have suffered a distinct and actual diminution
 of their willingness to speak, publish and associate freely and openly
 without fear of government intrusion and reprisal.
 79.     As a direct result of Defendants' conduct, the Plaintiffs and class
 members have suffered a distinct and actual restriction on their freedom of
 speech, press and association.
 80.     As a direct result of the Defendants' conduct, the Plaintiffs have
 suffered actual damages, attorneys' fees, and costs.

 VII.  THIRD CLAIM - FOURTH AMENDMENT
 (FREEDOM FROM UNREASONABLE SEARCHES AND SEIZURES)
 81.     The allegations in paragraphs 1-80 are incorporated herein by
 reference.
 82.     The Plaintiffs and class members had a reasonable expectation of
 privacy in their private electronic communications and subscriber records
 resident on the Cincinnati Computer Connection BBS.
 83.     The Defendants' actions violated the Plaintiffs' and class members'
 clearly established right to be free from unreasonable searches and
 seizures as guaranteed by the Fourth Amendment and Fourteenth Amendments to
 the United States Constitution and 42 U.S.C. 1983.
 84.     The search and seizure at the location of the Cincinnati Computer
 Connection BBS was a illegal and unwarranted general search.
 85.     The search and seizure of the Cincinnati Computer Connection BBS
 was not authorized by a valid warrant particularly describing the place to
 be searched and the things to be seized.
 86.     The search warrant did not authorize the seizure of the Cincinnati
 Computer Connection BBS or any of its contents, including the Plaintiffs'
 and class members' private electronic communications and subscriber
 records.
 87.     The search warrant failed to establish probable cause to believe
 that any of the Plaintiffs' or the class members' private electronic
 communications was relevant to a legitimate law enforcement inquiry.
 88.     The search warrant failed to establish probable cause to believe
 that the Plaintiffs' and class members' private electronic communications
 contained evidence of the offense listed in the search warrant, or any
 offense, for that matter.
 89.     The Defendants knew, or reasonably should have known, that their
 conduct violated the Plaintiffs' and class members' clearly established
 constitutional right to be free from unreasonable searches and seizures.
 90.     The Defendants acted with intent to violate, or with reckless
 indifference to, the Plaintiffs' and class members' clearly established
 Fourth Amendment rights.
 91.     At all times relevant herein, Defendants were acting under color of

 92.     As a direct result of the Defendants' conduct, the Plaintiffs have
 suffered actual damages, attorneys' fees, and costs.

 VIII.   FOURTH CLAIM - OHIO CONSTITUTION ARTICLE I, SECTION 11
 (FREEDOM FROM UNREASONABLE SEARCHES AND SEIZURES)
 93.     The allegations in paragraphs 1-92 are incorporated herein by
 reference.
 94.     In the same manner that the Defendants' actions violated the
 Plaintiffs and the class members' rights under the Fourth Amendment, the
 Defendants' acts violated the Plaintiffs' and class members' clearly
 established right to be free from unreasonable searches and seizures
 guaranteed by Article I, Section 11 of the Constitution of the State of
 Ohio.
 95.     As a direct result of the Defendants' conduct, the Plaintiffs have

 Cincinnati Computer Connection that were not accessible to the general
 public.
 101.    Upon information and belief, when Defendants applied for a warrant
 to search and seize the computer operating the Cincinnati Computer
 Connection BBS and all data stored thereon, they failed to inform the
 issuing Judge that the computer contained stored electronic communications
 that were not accessible to the general public and that were protected by
 18 U.S.C. 2501, et seq. and 18 U.S.C. 2701, et seq.
 102.    The search warrant obtained by Defendants failed to state or be
 supported by any probable cause to believe that the Plaintiffs or class
 members' private electronic communications constituted evidence of any
 offense named in the warrant, or any criminal offense whatsoever.
 103.    The search warrant obtained by Defendants failed to state, or be
 supported by, reason to believe that the Plaintiffs or class members'
 private electronic communications were relevant to a legitimate law
 enforcement inquiry, in violation of 18 U.S.C. 2703(d).
 104.    Defendants, acting without a valid warrant, and without a court

 XI.     SEVENTH CLAIM - ELECTRONIC COMMUNICATIONS PRIVACY ACT
 (UNLAWFUL INTERCEPTION OF ELECTRONIC COMMUNICATIONS, U.S.C. 2511 et seq.)
 118.    The allegations in paragraphs 1-117 are incorporated herein by
 reference.
 119.    At all relevant times, Plaintiffs and/or some or all of the class
 members had electronic communications in transit on the Cincinnati Computer
 Connection that were not accessible to the general public.  Such
 communications had been written, addressed, and sent, but not yet received
 and read by the addressees.
 120.    Defendants intercepted, disclosed, or intentionally used such
 electronic communications, without the consent of the Plaintiffs or the
 class members, in violation of 18 U.S.C. 2510 et seq. and 2520.
 121.    Defendants intentionally intercepted, endeavored to intercept, or
 procured others to intercept or endeavor to intercept, the Plaintiffs'
 and/or class members' electronic communications, without the consent of the
 Plaintiffs or the class members, in violation of 18 U.S.C. 2511(1)(a).
 122.    The warrant application was not authorized by the appropriate
 federal or state law enforcement officials as required by 18 U.S.C. 2516.
 123.    The Defendants did not comply with the standards and procedures

 128.    The allegations in paragraphs 1-127 are incorporated herein by
 reference.
 129.    The Defendants intercepted and seized, without legal justification
 or right, the Plaintiffs' private electronic communications.  Upon

 these private communications.  The Defendants have failed and refused to
 return any such private communications, and have failed to provide for the
 delivery to the intended recipients of the electronic communications they
 unlawfully seized.
 130.    The Defendants' acts constitute an invasion of the Plaintiffs' and
 class members' privacy by intruding upon their seclusion.
 131.    At all times relevant herein, Defendants were acting under color of
