Subject: File 1--RFD: comp.society.cu-digest

(Moderators' note: Chip Rosenthal has been instrumental in advocating
changing Cu Digest from an alt to a comp group in the Usenet
hierarchy. He posted the following on Usenet's news.groups list).

    PROPOSAL:comp.society.cu-digest (moderated)

    CHARTER:The Computer Underground Digest

    SUMMARY:    The proposed newsgroup will be used to distributed the
Computer Underground Digest.  The CuD is an open forum for issues
relating to the phenomena of computer cracking.  It has been in
publication since 1990, and is widely distributed in a number of
electronic forms.

The Computer Underground Digest began publication in early 1990 to
discuss the issues related to computer cracking -- and the crackdown
on cracking.  Shortly thereafter, a gateway was instituted to
distribute CuD via alt.society.cu-digest.  If this proposal passes,
the gateway destination will be changed to comp.society.cu-digest and
the alt.society.cu-digest newsgroup will be decommissioned.

Since the CuD is an edited periodical (a la RISKS Digest), it is best
handled as a moderated newsgroup.  The editors of the CuD are
reachable via Internet mail at the address <tk0jut2@mvs.cso.niu.edu>.
That would be used as the `mailpaths' address for the moderated group.

If you have never seen the CuD, volume 4, issue 26 was posted to
alt.society.cu-digest recently.  You might want to check it out.

I asked the editors of the CuD to contribute a brief description for
inclusion in ths RFD.  This is what they provided:

  | Computer underground Digest (or CuD) began in March, 1990, to continue
  | discussion of so-called "hacker crackdowns," especially the
  | Phrack/Craig Neidorf indictment, that Pat Townson (moderator of
  | Telecom Digest) was unable to publish. CuD's editors, Jim Thomas and
  | Gordon Meyer, assumed that CuD would be a temporary forum.  But, as
  | articles came in and the scope of the discussions expanded, CuD has
  | become an established electronic journal.
  |
  | Although classified as a "hack-symp 'zine" by The Village Voice, CuD
  | encourages articles that reflect a diversity of opinion, politics, and
  | ideology.  CuD is an open forum dedicated to sharing information among
  | computerists and to the presentation and debate of diverse views.
  | Readers are encouraged to submit reasoned articles relating to
  | computer culture and communication.  Discussions of the legal,
  | ethical, social, and political implications of "cyberspace" and
  | computer culture provide the core of CuD articles. The editors
  | strongly encourage debate over the content and direction of computer
  | technology in contemporary society.

I am not involved in the production of the CuD in any way.  I merely
operate the gateway to distribute CuD via USENET.  This proposal is
being made with the knowledge and support of the CuD editors.  I would
be glad to answer questions regarding this RFD or the USENET gateway.
Questions regarding the content of the CuD should be directed to the
editors at <tk0jut2@mvs.cso.niu.edu>.  Followups have been directed
to news.groups.  Mail replies have been directed to an alias which
reaches both the moderators and myself.  If there is consensus that
this proposal is reasonable, I will bring it to a vote in approximately
two weeks.

Subject: File 2--Changing CuD to a Comp Usenet Group (Moderators' view)

Thanks to Chip and others who have suggested and supported changing
CuD to a comp group. The advantage of changing is this:
The current readership is between 26,000-30,000 (about 16,000 on usenet
as alt.society.cu-digest) and the rest on GEnie, Compuserve, BBSes and
news-feeds and a large mailing list. The number of sites carrying alt
groups seems to be diminishing (according to usenet stats), and a
shift to comp would enable us to reduce the mailing list (and thus
bandwidth), expand the access of to CuD a significant number of
readers who lacking access to alt groups, and to improve the quality
of articles by expanding the pool or readers (and presumably
contributors).

CuD focuses on computer issues relevant to scholars, researchers, and the
media in much the same way as other comp groups (EFF, Telecom Digest,
RISKS) does. The primary difference is that we encourage articles
(rather than sort posts, although we try to include as many posts as
space allows). Our primary interest is on the legal and cultural
aspects of cyberspace, and we try to keep readers informed of relevant
computer conferences, computer-related news, book reviews, and
summaries of research on computer culture. The current mailing list
is about 50 percent computer professionals and academics, 30 percent
media, law enforcement, government/military agencies and non-computer
professionals, and 20 percent students. Although we have no hard data,
we assume that the usenet stats correspond to the mailing list
(judging from responses).

For those unsure of what CuD is: CuD stands for Computer underground
Digest, a name that was given to the first issue by a poster and the name
stuck. Recent issues have included transcripts of the PHRACK trial,
the Playboy/Event Horizons' suit, summaries, transcripts, and the text of
the FBI's proposed wire tap legislation, and attempts to make presidential
candidates aware of the power of electronic media as a "town-hall forum."
Subscriptions are available by dropping a one word "SUBSCRIBE" note
(with address included underneath):
  example:        SUB CuD

Mail the requests to  TK0JUT2@mvs.cso.niu.edu or TK0JUT2@niu.bitnet

We appreciate the support we have received for re-naming, and we
encourage readers to vote in support of the change in two weeks.

Subject: File 3--CFP'93 Call for Participation

                 Call for Participation
                         CFP'93
   The Third Conference on Computers, Freedom and Privacy
         Sponsored by ACM SIGCOMM, SIGCAS & SIGSAC
                    9 - 12 March 1993
     San Francisco Airport Marriott Hotel, Burlingame, CA

INVITATION

This is an invitation to submit session and topic proposals for
inclusion in the program of the Third Conference on Computers,
Freedom and Privacy.  Proposals may be for individual talks, panel
discussions, debates or other presentations in appropriate
formats. Proposed topics should be within the general scope of the
conference, as outlined below.

SCOPE

The advance of computer and telecommunications technologies holds
great promise for individuals and society. From convenience for
consumers and efficiency in commerce to improved public health and
safety and increased participation in democratic institutions,
these technologies can fundamentally transform our lives.

At the same time these technologies pose threats to the ideals of
a free and open society. Personal privacy is increasingly at risk
from invasion by high-tech surveillance and eavesdropping. The
myriad databases containing personal information maintained in the
public and private sectors expose private life to constant
scrutiny.

Technological advances also enable new forms of illegal activity,
posing new problems for legal and law enforcement officials and
challenging the very definitions of crime and civil liberties. But
technologies used to combat these crimes can threaten the
traditional barriers between the individual and the state.

Even such fundamental notions as speech, assembly and property are
being transformed by these technologies, throwing into question
the basic Constitutional protections that have guarded them.
Similarly, information knows no borders; as the scope of economies
becomes global and as networked communities transcend
international boundaries, ways must be found to reconcile
competing political, social and economic interests in the digital
domain.

The Third Conference on Computers, Freedom and Privacy will
assemble experts, advocates and interested people from a broad
spectrum of disciplines and backgrounds in a balanced public forum
to address the impact of computer and telecommunications
technologies on freedom and privacy in society. Participants will
include people from the fields of computer science, law, business,
research, information, library science, health, public policy,
government, law enforcement, public advocacy and many others.

Topics covered in previous CFP conferences include:

Personal Information and Privacy
International Perspectives and Impacts
Law Enforcement and Civil Liberties
Ethics, Morality and Criminality
Electronic Speech, Press and Assembly
Who Logs On (Computer & Telecom Networks)
Free Speech and the Public Telephone Network
Access to Government Information
Computer-based Surveillance of Individuals
Computers in the Workplace
Who Holds the Keys? (Cryptography)
Who's in Your Genes? (Genetic Information)
Ethics and Education
Public Policy for the 21st Century

These topics are given as examples and are not meant to exclude
other possible topics on the general subject of Computers, Freedom
and Privacy.

PROPOSAL SUBMISSION

All proposals should be accompanied by a position statement of at
least one page, describing the proposed presentation, its theme
and format. Proposals for panel discussions, debates and other
multi-person presentations should include a list of proposed
participants and session chair. Proposals should be sent to:

Subject: File 4--CPSR membership info

COMPUTER PROFESSIONALS FOR SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY is a public-interest
alliance of computer scientists and others interested in the impact of
computer technology on society.  We work to influence decisions
regarding the development and use of computers because those decisions
have far-reaching consequences and reflect basic values and
priorities.

As technical experts, CPSR members provide the public and policymakers
with realistic assessments of the power, promise, and limitations of
computer technology.  As concerned citizens, we direct public
attention to critical choices concerning the applications of computing
and how those choices affect society.

Members of CPSR believe that computer technology should make life more
enjoyable, productive, and secure.  We are working for a world in
which science and technology are used not to produce weapons of war,
but to foster a safe and just society.  These concerns impel us to
many forms of action:

  o  We encourage public discussion of and public responsibility for
     decisions involving the use of computers in systems critical to
     society.

  o  We work to dispel popular myths about the infallibility of
     technological systems.

  o  We challenge the assumption that technology alone can solve
     political and social problems.

  o  We encourage critical examination of social and technical issues
     within the computer profession, nationally and internationally.

  o  We encourage the use of computer technology to improve the quality
     of life.

                              CPSR HISTORY
                              ------------
Since its beginnings as a small discussion group formed over a Palo
Alto computer mail network in 1981, CPSR has grown into a national
organization with 21 chapters throughout the United States.  We are also
affiliated with similar groups in Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Great
Britain, Germany, Finland, and Italy.  Membership is open to all.

                              CPSR PROJECTS
                              -------------
Risk and Reliability:

Overreliance on computing technology can lead to unacceptable risks.
This project analyzes application areas in which those risks seem
particularly serious:

  o  SDI software problems
  o  dangers of autonomous weapons
  o  the inadequacy of simulation as a means for testing complex systems
  o  the potential for software failure in life-critical systems

Civil Liberties and Privacy:

The growing use of computers for record-keeping has brought with it the
danger that the vast amount of information maintained about individuals
threatens our privacy.  Centered in our Washington D.C. office, the
Civil Liberties and Privacy Project is concerned with such topics as:

  o  the FBI National Crime Information Center
  o  the growing use of databases of personal information by both
     government and private industry
  o  the right of public access to government information
  o  extension of First Amendment rights to electronic communication
  o  establishing legal protections for privacy of computerized
     information

The CPSR Workplace Project:

By the mid-1990s, most U.S. workers will use a computer on the job.
The increasing use of computers in the workplace raises important
social issues, and CPSR believes that it is important for computer
professionals to be involved in this debate.  CPSR's Computers in the
Workplace Project has concentrated on the following topics:

  o  design methodologies for workplace software
  o  electronic monitoring of workers on the job
  o  health problems associated with computer use

The 21st Century Project:

Since the Second World War, most U.S. research in science and technology
has been funded by the military and directed toward military needs.
With the end of the Cold War and the changes that have swept Eastern
Europe and the Soviet Union, it is time to refocus our scientific and
technological research toward the problems that society faces as we
enter the next century.

The 21st Century Project, led by CPSR from our Cambridge office, is a
coalition of professional organizations working to redirect national
science and technology priorities, so that they more closely match
social needs.

Grassroots Projects:

CPSR's chapter-based projects and national interest groups span a wide
range of issues, including:

  o  computers in education
  o  computers and the environment
  o  viruses and threats to computer security
  o  computerized vote-counting systems
  o  status of women in computer science
  o  implications of speculative technologies such as nanotechnology
     and virtual reality

                               HIGHLIGHTS
                               ----------
In the ten years since CPSR's creation, CPSR has been effective in
alerting the public and key decision-makers in the U.S. and abroad
about the impact of computers on society:

  o  CPSR published the first papers and held the first public debates
     on the computing aspects of the Strategic Defense Initiative, or
     "Star Wars."

  o  CPSR members testified before a U.S. Senate subcommittee on the
     feasibility of SDI.

  o  CPSR/Boston produced an award-winning slide show and videotape
     called "Reliability and Risk: Computers and Nuclear War."

  o  CPSR members produced the first book for general audiences on the
     ways in which computers revolutionize modern weapons systems,
     *Computers in Battle: Will they Work?*

  o  At the request of a House subcommittee, CPSR studied the FBI's
     proposed National Crime Information Center upgrade (NCIC 2000).
     CPSR's report was widely credited for the FBI's subsequent decision
     to drop a proposal to track individuals who had not been charged
     with any crime.

  o  CPSR co-produced a "Special Report on Computers and Elections"
     for the 1988 Presidential Campaign, highlighting the potential
     for errors in electronic vote-counting systems.

  o  CPSR filed lawsuits under the Freedom of Information Act to force
     the FBI and Secret Service to reveal whether they monitor computer
     bulletin boards and electronic mail.

  o  CPSR/Portland hosted a conference on Computers and the Environment.

  o  The CPSR Workplace Project organized PDC'90--the first U.S.
     conference on participatory design, in which users work together
     with software designers to ensure that systems meet workers' needs.

  o  CPSR helped lead a successful grassroots campaign to convince the
     Lotus Development Corporation not to release their proposed
     Marketplace: Households product, which would have included data
     on 120 million Americans.

  o  CPSR/Berkeley organized a media campaign to register our concern
     over the deadly role of computing technology in the Persian Gulf
     War.

                          MEMBERSHIP BENEFITS
                          -------------------
  o  The CPSR Newsletter--a highly regarded magazine with reviews of
     CPSR's activities and analyses of issues of concern to CPSR members.

  o  Invitations and discounts to CPSR events, including the annual
     meeting, our biannual conference on Directions and Implications
     of Advanced Computing, and various special events.

  o  Notice of new CPSR educational materials, including videotapes,
     research papers, and books.

  o  Automatic membership in a local CPSR chapter (if available) and
     notices of chapter meetings and activities.

COMPUTER PROFESSIONALS FOR SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY
NAMES EVELYN PINE NEW MANAGING DIRECTOR


PALO ALTO, Calif., June 5, 1992 -- Computer Professionals for Social
Responsibility (CPSR), the national alliance of professionals concerned
with the impact of technology on society based here, announced that
it has named Evelyn Pine  as Managing Director.  Pine, who reports to
the organization's Board of Directors, is responsible for the overall
administration of the national organization, including coordination
with its offices in Cambridge, MA and Washington, D.C.  In addition,
Pine will be responsible for the design and implementation of a long-
range organizational development plan.

"Whether fighting to protect civil liberties in the information age,
or forging a non-military agenda for American research and
development, CPSR will continue to challenge both government
and industry to insure that technology serves human needs,"
Pine said.

For ten years, Pine has worked to ensure that Americans make
meaningful use of electronic technology.  She comes to CPSR
from a stint as the Executive Director of The Community Memory
Project, the first participatory, public access computer network
in the country.  While there, she encouraged seniors low income
families and at risk youth to use the network, located in Berkeley,
California, to share information and discuss crucial issues.  As Deputy
Director of the Foundation for Community Service Cable TV, Pine
worked with local governments, schools, and community
organizations to create local cable programming.

"CPSR is extremely fortunate to have someone of Evelyn's caliber to
oversee and direct our national effort.  Over the last ten years, CPSR
has established itself as a critical voice in the public debate over
technology," said Eric Roberts, president of the board of directors.
"Evelyn brings considerable talent and experience to this position.
We feel that she is the right person to lead CPSR into our second
decade."

Founded in 1981, CPSR is a public interest alliance of computer
scientists and other professionals interested in the impact of
computer technology on society.  As technical experts and
informed citizens, CPSR members provide the public and policy
makers with realistic assessments of the power, promise, and
limitations of computer technology.

CPSR began as a small discussion group formed over a electronic
mail network.  Today it has grown into a national organization,
with 21 chapters in the United States.  The organization also has
program offices  in Washington D.C. and Cambridge, MA.

The Washington D.C. office is the focal point for CPSR's Civil Liberties
and Privacy Program.  This effort is concerned with equitable public
access to government information; protection of First Amendment
rights in electronic communication;  and rights of privacy attached to
computerized information.

The Cambridge, MA office is the focal point for the organization's
21st Century Project.  It is a coalition of professional organizations
working to redirect national science and technology priorities, so that
they more closely match social needs.

Subject: File 6--Gore introduces Senate version of WINDO

-  Gore, Ford, Sarbanes and Simons introduce Senate verions of GPO WINDO.

-  Name of bill is changed to GPO Gateway to Government

-  Fiscal note is $3 million in fy 93, $10 million in fy 94.

On June 4, 1992 Senators Gore, Ford, Sarbanes and Simons introduced S.
2813, the GPO Gateway to Government.  The text of the bill was printed
on page S. 7599 of the Congressional Record.  The bill, which I
haven't seen yet, is reportedly very similiar to Rose's hr 2772.

All four cosponsors are democrats.  It was a pleasant surprise that
Senator Ford, who chairs the Senate Rules Committee (where the bill is
referred) was among the sponors.  Unfortunately, Senator Stevens
(R-AK) was not among the originial cosponsors.

As readers of this list may know, the GPO WINDO (HR 2772) and the GPO
Gateway to Government (S 2813) would provide one-stop-shopping online
access to federal government databases and and information systems.
The service would be free to 1,400 federal depository libraries and
available for subscriptions in homes and offices, priced at the
incremental cost of disseminating the information.  The service would
be available through the internet and over ordinary telephone lines
using a modem.  For more information, contact Anne Heanue, American
Library Association 202/547-4440; Bernadine Hoduski, Joint Committee
on Printing 202/224-5953; or James Love, Taxpayer Assets Project

Subject: File 7--NY Telephone Cuts Int'l Service At Some pay Phones (NEWSBYTES)

NEW YORK, NEW YORK, U.S.A., 1992 JUN 18 (NB) -- As part of its effort
to figh phone fraud with stolen calling card numbers, New York
Telephone is blocking international calls from most of its public
phones inside the Port Authority Bus Terminal and at surrounding
sidewalk locations.  The company said it would also target other
high-fraud areas throughout New York City.

New York Telephone will rely on technology developed by Mars
Electronics International, based in Pennsylvania, which blocks
international calls attempted through any long distance carrier or
private business phone system.  New York Telephone said it would
implement the program at selected public phones so as not to
inconvenience legitimate callers.

This is the second time that phone companies have limited service at
pay phones as an anti-crime move. A few years ago, some phones were
switched from touchtone to rotary dial service, to keep people using
them from reaching beepers allegedly used by drug dealers.

Now the problem is "sidewalk surfing," where thieves listen to callers
giving their card numbers to operators, or peer over their shoulders
when they take out calling cards. The numbers are then taken to a pay
phone, where services using them are sold to all comers. Frequently,
the services are sold to drug dealers, who can then make untraceable
calls to their overseas contacts. Some observers claim that the
numbers are also used by illegal immigrants calling their families
back home.

Telephone fraud is estimated at more than $1 billion a year
nationwide.  New York Telephone operates more than 57,000 public
phones in New York City.

****NY Police Responds To Blockage Of Int'l Phone Calls 06/18/92

WASHINGTON, D.C., U.S.A., 1992 JUN 18 (NB) -- New York State Police
Special Investigator Donald Delaney, in a conversation with Newsbytes,
strongly supported the move by New York Telephone Company, blocking
calls to foreign countries from pay phones in New  York City's Times
Square , Port Authority Bus Terminal and other midtown locations with
a history of high credit card calling fraud, as reported elsewhere by
Newsbytes.

Delaney said: "I think that it is about time that such action was
taken.  Telephone fraud in New York City is out of control and that is
why that New York Telephone took the action"

Delaney continued: "I think that this should be just the beginning. It
is not only in midtown Manhattan that we find this fraud. From one end
of Broadway t another, there is heavy incidence of fraudulent calls
through pay phones. You will also find neighborhoods that have high
incidence of the same type of crime. I would like to see the same type
of blockage on all pay phones." The Port Authority Bus Terminal has
long been identified as a major scene of telecommunications fraud
encompassing not only call selling by the collection of valid credit
card numbers from unsuspecting users so that numbers may, in turn, be
used for fraudulent calls. The numbers are generally taken through
"shoulder-surfing", a term for simply looking over the shoulder of an
unsuspecting caller and recording the keystrokes made while entering
the credit card number.

According to Delaney, shoulder-surfing in the Port Authority takes in
a whole new dimension with people using binoculars and telescopes from
positions in Port Authority's balcony to see the numbers and
voice-activated tape recorder to record them.
