Subject: RE: CuD #1.01


	Regarding Marks' comments about being on a mailing list triggering
harassing action, I have experience showing it happens.

	Back in about 1970, in my misspent youth, I subscribed to a little-known
newsletter called "The Tel Line". This was a phreak magazine that was
published in Southern Cal somewhere, and was a precursor to most of the
P/hack digests that exist today. Included was the normal blue box/ loop
line generalized phreaking stuff that was very active at the time. (BTW:
2600 magazine had a short article on this magazine back in 88 or so).

	...anyway, I remember getting an issue in which the editorial talked about
the publishers getting heat from Bell Tel, and being asked to turn over
their subscription list to the "authorities". I never received another
issue, but shortly after that, I (and my parents!!!) began receiving
threatening phone calls and letters from Pac Bell, claiming I was involved
in red box activity. Knowing what I know now, I should have told those
"authorities" where to pack it, but at 14 or so, I was a bit nervous!
Anyway at that time I had had no other contacts with the phreak world, and
my experience was limited to dialing 100's of 800 numbers and dialing thru
local exchanges looking for test numbers, ringbacks etc. This local
experimentation was in the Mountain Bell region and had nothing to do with
either red boxes or Pac Bell. Anyway, it was obvious that the phone cops
had gotten hold of the mailing list.

	Since this happened back in the neolithic era (pre-PC's! And my parents
only bought rotary service... sore fingers!!_) I'm sure that the state of
the art of intelligence gathering by "the authorities" has  advanced quite
a bit, and I am sure that there are a few corporate security subscribers
out there taking names.

	Hell if I care! Give 'em 1000's of names! Keep 'em busy! But be aware that
"Big Brother" does indeed listen!
