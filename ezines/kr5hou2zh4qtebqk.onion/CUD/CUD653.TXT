Subject: File 1--Amateur Action BBS Indictment

***WARNING: THE TEXT OF THE FOLLOWING INDICTMENT CONTAINS GRAPHIC
AND EXPLICIT DESCRIPTIONS OF SEX ACTS THAT SOME MAY FIND
OFFENSIVE***

((MODERATORS' NOTE: As we reported in CuD #6.35 and previously,
Amateur Action BBS in California has been the target of law
enforcement activity for several years. When a local raid failed to
produce anything illegal on the board, the US Postal Service ran what
has been described as a sting/entrapment ploy to charge the sysop,
Robert Thomas, with crimes that--while not violating California laws,
allegedly violate Tennessee statutes.

The allegations raise questions of obscenity and child pornography.
Because of their nature, such charges often fail to generate public
awareness, let alone sympathy.  However, as reported earlier, the
issues in this case bear directly on First Amendment rights in
cyberspace.  One of the most important issues is: Can a file or image
that is legal in one area of the US be subject to federal prosecution
because it might violate statutes in another area? Does the fact that
a person with a modem in Tennessee can transport files from a system
in California subject the California source to federal prosecution,
even though those operating the California system were not themselves
responsible for transfering files into Tennessee? The Amateur Action
BBS case raises many questions about judicial procedures, but the most
disturbing issue is this:  If the prosecution is successful, it could
set a precedent in which freedom of speech is subverted on the Nets by
establishing as a standard the most restrictive criteria in a given
jurisdiction and making it the de facto national standard).

I thought the folks who read alt.sex.* and the other places where this
story has been posted might be interested in what an indictment for
50-60 years of jail time and a 2-3 million dollar fine looks like.
Such a sensible use of tax money, and law enforcement effort!  (Hope
you all feel safer now.)

The thing which *really* steams me is that stuff on which the kiddy
porn count (11) is based was described by the postal inspector at the
time of the search as "sent without his (the sysop's) knowledge."
Furthermore, the same postal inspector told me that sending folks
unsolicited kiddy porn was "ordinary investigative procedure."

I have not bothered to look at the GIFs.  They are still posted on the
BBS.  Nobody has requested that they be made unavailable even to the
(unsophisticated?) people of western Tennessee.  I do know that
descriptions of these things are "enhanced" (in such matters as
relations) to or beyond the limits of the possible.  They are, after
all, fantasy.

This is a rough scan job.  The copy I have is not that good, my
scanner is not the best at picking up this stuff, and I only spent a
few hours fixing the errors.  Sorry, but I just can't take more time.

You might note the large amount of space they devoted to the forfeit
count.  I wonder how much a chance to acquire the spiffy hardware
drove the whole investigation.

THE GRAND JURY CHARGES:
                        COUNT 1
    1.       Beginning at a date unknown to the Grand Jury, but at
least in or about February, 1991, and continuing thereafter until
on or about the date of this Indictment, in the Western District of
Tennessee, and elsewhere, the defendants,
 ---------------------- ROBERT ALAN  THOMAS -------------------------
 ------------------------------ and --------------------------------
 ------------------------ CARLEEN THOMAS---------------------------
did knowingly and wilfully combine, conspire, confederate and agree
with each other and with other persons unknown to the Grand Jury,
to commit certain offenses against the United States of America,
that is:
     (a)  to knowingly use and caused to be used an express company
and  common  carrier, that  is, United    Parcel      Service  (UPS), for


                         1


carriage in interstate commerce, obscene video cassette tapes; in
violation of Title 18, United States Code, Section 1462;
    (b)  to knowingly use and caused to be used a facility and
means of interstate commerce, that is a combined computer/telephone
system,  for  the  purpose  of      transporting  obscene  material  in
interstate commerce; said obscene material being computer-generated
images, referred to as a Graphics Interchange Format ("GIF") files;
in violation of Title 18, United States Code, Section 1465.

             FORM AND SUBSTANCE OF THE CONSPIRACY
     2.   It  was  a  part  of      the  conspiracy  that,  in  or      about
February, 1991, the defendants would establish a "computer bulletin
board" at their residence, 475 Tramway Drive, Milpitas, California,
using the name "Amateur Action Bulletin Board System" (AABBS).
     3.   It  was  further  a  part  of  the  conspiracy  that    the
defendants would utilize a "mail drop" service known as Mail Boxes,
Etc.,  U.S.A.,    and  142  North  Milpitas  Blvd.  #284,  Milpitas,
California  95035,  as  the  business  address  for  Amateur  Action
Bulletin Board System.
    4,       It  was  a  further  part  of      the  conspiracy  that  the
defendants   would   utilize   interstate   telephone services   in
conducting  their  computer  bulletin  board  system, using  specific
telephone numbers including (408) 263--3393 and (408) 263-3396.
     5,   It  was  a  further  part  of  the  conspiracy  that    the
defendants, through the use of their computer bulletin board, would
advertise  and    sell  obscene  video  cassette      tapes  and  obscene


                         2


computer-generated  images  known  as  Graphics  Interchange  Format
(GIF) files to members of the public, nationwide.
    6.       It  was  a  further  part  of      the  conspiracy  that  the
defendants would utilize an express company and common carrier,
that is United Parcel Service (UPS), to distribute their obscene
video cassette tapes to members of the public, nationwide.

     7.   Defendants  generally  used  the  following  method  of
operation  in  conducting  their  computer  bulletin  board  (AABBS)
business with members of the public:
     Defendants  had  multiple      computers  and     'modems    at  their
residence in Milpitas, California.   A     modem'  is a device which
allows      the  transmission  and  receipt  of  computerized  data,
interstate,  over  telephone  lines  between  computers.     Such
transmissions are known as   uploads'  by the computer sending the
data, and "downloads" by the computer receiving the data.  Through
the use  of a "modem" any  person  who also had  a  computer  could
"connect" their  computer  with  defendants   computer      by  dialing
defendants'  business  telephone  number   and    logging   on    to
defendants'  system.   Once ' logged  on   to  defendant s  computer
system        a   person   could   review advertisements,   membership
application requirements, and other information on defendants
computer.  Once obtaining membership and an individual password, a
person could, additionally,  'download   Graphics Interchange Format
(GIF) files to his/her own computer, purchase video cassette tapes,


                         3


magazines, and "GIF Packs" and, if the defendants desired, have a
one-to-one  computer  conversation  with  the  defendants  through
defendants' use of the "chat" mode.
     To obtain membership to defendants' business (AABBS), a person
had to complete an application and send a specified sum of money to
defendants.  Defendants also allowed immediate membership to AABBS
if  the  person  provided  credit  card  information (Master  Card  or
Visa).      For approximately $55.00, a person was entitled to a six-
month  access  to  defendants'  computer,  with  a  1.2  "megabyte"
download  limit and a time limit of ninety (90) minutes per day.
For  approximately  $99.00,  a      person      was  entitled  to  a  one-year
access to defendants' computer, with the same download and  time
limits as the six-month membership.

                OBJECT OF THE CONSPIRACY
     8.   It was a principal object of the conspiracy to carry out
and  execute  the  abovesaid  business,  involving  distribution  of
obscene material, utilizing the computer bulletin board system, for
the  ultimate  personal  gain,      benefit,  profit,  advantage  and
accommodation of the defendants and their co-conspirators.

                     OVERT ACTS
     9        At all times hereinafter mentioned, during the pendency
of the conspiracy, the following overt acts were engaged in, at
least  one  of    which  furthered  and  effected  the  goals  of  said
combination, conspiracy, confederation and agreement:


                         4


     (a)  Between in or about February, 1991, and the date of this

Milpitas, California.

     (b)  On  or  about  February  18, 1991,  defendant  ROBERT
THOMAS signed a "Mailbox Service Agreement" with Mail Boxes Etc.,
U.S.A., 142 North Milpitas Blvd., Milpitas, California 95035.

    (c)  On  or  about  October  10,  1991,  defendant      ROBERT
