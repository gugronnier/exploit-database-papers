In CuD 6.45 The Advocate <cudigest@mindvox.phantom.com> replied to my
posting in CuD 6.43 about reporting to an FBI agent serious crimes
against the court,

This *was* the very first thing we did, I gave *the* clerk of the
court a copy of the original letter of complaint, along with a copy of
it to give to the chief judge.  Near as we can determine, the clerks
just toss such letters.  They deny any ability to do any kind of
investigation, and will not even tell you if a letter actually was
seen by a judge!

Two of the judges (Brazil and Caufield) deny that they have any power
to bring about any kind of investigation.

I tend to agree with you here, but I know of several other cases where
judges were kept in the dark--one was kept from knowing that a case
had even been assigned to him.  The problem is how to get your message
through the very good flappers.  *I* tried to give a letter to a judge
in open court and failed to get it to her.  Any suggestions or help
would be very helpful.  Does anyone know someone with an email address
who can call up and talk to a judge?

>The third course is to call the Congressional over-sight commission.

Good thought--I wonder if Don Edwards has enough energy left to take
this one on?  (However, I would bet I get the brushoff.)

>They can have the GAO investigate as well as hold hearings, and
>wouldn't the republican senators like to stick it to Janet Reno.

I kind of doubt republicans would be interested since every one of the
people involved are them.  But I would be very happy to forward the
lot of this stuff (by postal mail even) if anyone has an address I
should send it to.

>The fourth course is to send the information to Jack Anderson.   he's
>always good for a red hot pin to the eyeball.

Excellent idea!  Does Anderson have a net address?

ALERT! PEACELINK ITALIA URGES HELP!

Twenty-four days after the first major crackdown on Fidonet Italia BBSes, on
Friday June 3, the Taranto Finance Police visited Taras Communications BBS,
the main National Peacelink node and data-bank. Acting after a warrant
issued by the Prosecutor of the same city, Giovanni Pugliese and his
wife were charged for the possession of "illegally copied software and
electronic equipment suitable to falsification." After searching their
apartment for more than 5 hours (from 5 pm to 10.30 pm), Finance
officials sealed off the PC and the modem running the BBS and seized
bank-account receipts and 174 floppy disks - leaving behind the
monitor. Because the Taranto node hosts most of the network archives
and all the email traffic, at the moment the entire national Peacelink
net is down.

"Taras Communications BBS has never had anything to do with software
piracy and is well know for its activities related to humanitarian,
social and community issues," Giovanni Pugliese said. "Peacelink and
its sister Fidonet Italia network had always pursued a very
restrictive policy against any illegally copied software on their
systems. Because Taras Communications BBS is the main National node of
Peacelink network, its forced closure, hopefully very short, will
result in a great damage for those hundreds of people - ranging from
journalists to simple citizens - that were widely relying upon its
everyday services."

With more than 30 nodes throughout the country, several Fidonet
gateways, and a project currently underway to connect directly to
Comlink and the other APC Networks via the Bolzano node,  Peacelink is
completely dedicated to peace-actions, human rights and ecology
issues. Founded in1992 as a specialized conference of Fidonet Italia
network, Peacelink became quickly independent and well known even
outside Italy. Recently the network hosted a national conference on
peace-related matters, becoming also the only communication link for
people in the former-Yugoslavia and the outside world. Peacelink was
also working to put online a daily newspaper, "I Siciliani", focused
on issues related to social problems of southern and insular parts of
the country.

The first phase of the crackdown (May 11-13) targeted Fidonet Italia
network in several cities in the northern and cental regions of Italy.
The Pesaro prosecutor, managing the biggest brach of the nationwide
operation, ordered the searching of 119 BBSes and the closure of
dozens of them - charging two people with software piracy. Another
branch of the investigation, run by the Torino Finance Police, claimed
a seizure "for a value of more than 4 billion of Italian lire (about
US $2,5 million), including 17 personal computers; 13,690 floppy disks
of illegally copied software," dozens of modems and electronic
devices. Fourteen people in Torino and Terni were charged with
"conspiracy with unknown for the crime of software piracy" - but no
arrests were made.

The new raid in Taranto occurred when sysops, users, media and
citizens started working together to understand the real sense of such
an operation.  Several articles appeared (including BITMagazine,
CommodoreGazette, L'Unita', La Repubblica), radio programs were aired
(Radio Citta' Futura, Roma, Nova Radio, Firenze, Radio Popolare,
Milano), public meetings are forthcoming (in Roma on June 27 and
Pesaro on June 30), with politicians closely watching the events.
Also, in the last few days the Pesaro judges ordered the first
restitutions of the seized materials: about 20 sysops got back their
computers and floppy disks (copied and under verification by
investigators), while trials are under schedule.

"Although rumours said that Peacelink was under inquiry since two
years ago, just weeks before the assassination of anti-mafia judge
Falcone, we didn't pay any attention to those voices,"  Alessandro
Marescotti (Peacelink National coordinator) said. "I was wrong: the
current raid against our main node and data-bank clearly shows that in
our country someone has interest to shut down one of the very few
organizations openly working against racism, war and mafia actions.
Peacelink is dumb now, and so are the hundreds of volunteers,
activists, journalists, citizens using its free services to make real
changes in our society."

Last week I posted the story about the new raid in Italy targeting the
main Peacelink node, Taras Communication BBS in Taranto.

Because, despite many efforts, at the moment Taras Communications is
still dumb, Peacelink Italia decided to launch an urgent request of
help to the International community.

Peacelink is launching an urgent appeal to the International community
to help its main node to be online again as soon as possible.

The request is for a donation of the minimum indispensabile equipment:

- one  PC 486 (8MB RAM, 380 MB Hard Disk);
- one modem (external, 38,400 bps, USRobotics or equivalent).

Thank you very much.

[From the _Irish_Times_]
                         ON THE NEW FRONTIER

Today marks the public launch of Electronic Frontier
Ireland, the new lobby group to promote digital culture and
protect the rights of those partaking in it. Michael
Cunningham and Fiachra <acute>O Marcaigh report

 .........................................

SUCH IS the pace of technological change nowadays that it has rapidly
outstripped the ability of legal systems to catch up _ creating many
grey areas on computer use and misuse, privacy and computer access.
It's one of the main reasons Tom Murphy gives for taking the
initiative to form Electronic Frontier Ireland (EFI).

  This legal uncertainty leaves individuals unsure of their rights, he
  argues, opening the way for shock-horror hacker scares, and hasty,
  repressive legislation or legal crackdowns in which all sorts of
  rights are ignored.

  In conversation it quickly becomes apparent that Murphy,
  who works as a programmer at a Dublin insurance company,
  believes in computers and communications technologies. Not
  just in the machines, or their productivity, but in all
  the social, educational and cultural opportunities that
  they open up.

 When he talks about people having their computer access cut
 off aribitrarily, a note of horror enters his voice. But
 then  when asked about the new organisation's top
 priorities, he stresses positive steps to safeguard and
 expand the possibilities of the digital revolution, in
 several broad areas such as:

 The promotion of Internet and bulletin board usage;

 The improvement of Irish communications structures;

 Clarification of the laws surrounding computer usage, and

 Safeguarding electronic privacy by setting up a ``key
 repository'' to allow people to encrypt their e-mail.


How it started

 Murphy's own experience of the Internet began as an
 undergraduate at Trinity College six years ago. ``This is
 where my interest came from. And I've always been involved
 in role-playing gaming,'' he says.  These two strands
 collided after ``Operation Sundevil'' in 1990, when
 anti-hacker raids by US law enforcement agencies spread
 ever wider, taking in bulletin boards and a range of
 ordinary, completely innocent users.

  Among the latter was Steve Jackson Games, a publisher of
  role-playing games. Murphy was among its many fans around
  the world, and was naturally surprised when its doors were
  broken down and computers confiscated in the search for an
  allegedly  stolen computer document.

  In the US, the raids sparked the formation of the
  Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) to defend the civil
  rights of computer users. But here in Ireland it was still
  ``very distant at the time,'' he recalls.

 Due to the circumstances in which the EFF was formed, and
 its high profile in successfully defending some people
 facing huge penalties for alleged hacking, there was an
 impression that its main purpose was to defend people
 caught up in hacking cases.  Murphy argues that the Irish
 situation is very different.

 ``We didn't really have people in the Irish policing system
 booting down the doors.  EFI is mainly not about that but
 about promoting computing culture,'' he says. ``The problem
 is that there's a lot of journalists out there who can't
 sell an article about ordinary computer usage but can about
 some 14-year-olds hacking into military systems or
 whatever.

 ``The EFF in the States have to fight against a suspicious
 and hostile government. We want to mould things before it
 ever gets to that stage, so that we can educate our
 government and the general public. We want to get it right
 first time and not have to try and change a bad set of
 laws.''


Access

 Meanwhile, other issues of rights, privacy, and access to
 networks were beginning to trickle onto the political
 agenda. ``It had been mulling over in my mind _ I'm the
 kind of person who supports Amnesty International, I'm wary
 of censorship in general,'' he says, recalling instances of
 people being kicked off systems in Ireland for things
 they'd said.

 Then after seeing an article about US Government policy on
 the encryption methods available to individuals, he mailed
 Stanton McCandlish at EFF about whether there was a similar
 group in Ireland. He also posted a message on tcd.talk, a
 computer mailing area in Trinity College for staff,
 students and some graduates.

  ``I got a number of replies, people saying very quickly
  that it's not about hacking but about rights  _ rights and
  freedom of speech and privacy on the one hand and on the
  other about more people using the Internet etc. The
  Internet is now attracting people from more walks of life
  and getting far easier to use _ it shouldn't be just for
  techie anoraks, an elite few with the knowledge, but about
  the basic right to communicate.''

 While EFI will not be expecting everybody to get free
 Internet access, it will be campaigning for it to be cheap.
 Among its long-term aims is that every library in Ireland
 should provide Internet access. Another issue is the
 allocation of resources; for example,  the much
 talked-about plans for EU structural funds envisage
 concrete highways rather than digital ones.  ``We could get
 a national network through connections in public libraries
 and so on,'' he says.


Privacy

 The US Government is currently attempting to promote one
method for encryption of digital communications: a hardware
standard based on a single computer chip which it says will
protect communications _ but which will also allow
law-enforcement agencies to overcome the encryption with a
``back door'' built into every chip. This has sent major
ripples throughout the international computing community,
with concern about the erosion of personal rights. Legal
uncertainty surrounds the main alternative _ softwar e  such
as PGP (Pretty Good Privacy)  which provides users with
powerful encryption techniques of their own and also allows
people to ``sign'' a letter electronically, proving that it
originated with them.

  To Murphy the case for ordinary users having their own
  means of encryption for e-mail is straightforward.

   ``What do you do when you mail a normal letter?'' he
   asks. ``You write it, you sign it with your signature,
   and then what? You put it in an envelope, you lick the
   envelope and seal it, and maybe even sign the back of it,
   then bring it to your post office and presume that the
   post office is not going to open your mail. If it did, it
   would be an enormous scandal.

 ``We already take that sort of privacy for granted. We want
 to get the same level of privacy and authenticity for
 electronic mail as ordinary mail. Basically PGP is the
 envelope, and PGP signatures are your signatures at the end
 of the (electronic) letter.''


Legislation

 The EFI argues that legislation in Ireland, just as in most
 other countries, has been slow to catch up with the digital
 explosion, in an era where a book, say, can now be
 electronically sent from one side of the planet to the
 other in seconds. ``Will judges be able to handle _ with
 the current laws _ the newer technologies and their
 cultures? Take the publishing laws. These were based on
 physical printing presses, and you knew where they were.
 But everything is so much quicker now _ the Data Protection
 Act is not based on the speed at which you can delete
 information.''

 For example, he says that when people resort to that Act to
     ask for computerised information about themselves which
     might be inaccurate or misleading, a company can quite
     easily hide the particular database, change the
     information or simply deny its existence. ``Computers
     work an awful lot faster than the law,'' he says,
     returning to the Operation Sundevil cases where US
     Government agents kicked down doors and sometimes bent
     the rules  ``because the old laws were insufficient''.
     There is a pressing need to change the law to ensure
     that the rights which people enjoy in other areas are
     guaranteed to computer users. To this end the EFI
     intends targeting the Law Reform Commission rather than
     looking for changes in the Constitution.



The future

 The EFI has taken shape over several months of busy
 networking. There were delays in getting the  association
 on its feet, ironing out legal and policy details. E-mail
 messages bounced back and forth to the EFF in the US at the
 rate of three a day. Electronic Frontier Australia (which
 began a few months ahead of EFI) also helped with advice.
 ``We're trying to get it right first time, spelling out
 clear short, medium and long-term aims,'' he says. The
 organisation is now  about to be incorporated as a
 non-profit company, it has a charter, an interim committee
 and a clear idea of where it's going.

 About 50 people have already signed up before today's
   official launch.  Many of the people who responded to the
   first e-mail postings canvassing interest in the idea
   also volunteered their professional skills. Murphy is
   particularly pleased that Eoin O'Dell, a TCD lecturer
   specialising in information technology law, has joined
   the committee as its legal adviser. There is no
   membership fee for ordinary individuals (unlike the EFF
   in the States, which charges $40) because EFI wants to
   encourage the widest possible membership base. They have
   a treasurer but no cash _ voluntary donations are
   welcomed and there will be a fee for corporate
   membership. ``The main problem we have is to educate the
   public and the politicians about the net and BBSes and
   what they offer Ireland. I can never understand why
   Ireland has not embraced the Internet _ given our
   geographical isolation _ but this is changing  and it was
   the imminent change that forced the creation of EFI. We
   want to mould the future politics of the Internet within
   Ireland.''

The International Association for Philosophy of Law and Social
Philosophy will hold its 17th world congress in Bologna (Italy) on
June 16th to 21st, 1995. The IVR world congress is the most important
congress on Philosophy of Law and Social Philosophy, and takes place
every 2 years in various parts of the world.

The 17th world congress will be devoted to the changes, new functions
and roles of law at the end of our century, bearing in mind the
crucial events that have characterized the last decade. New forms of
sovereignty and citizenship are appearing in Europe; new
international orders are prevailing in the world; problems of
nationality, religion and ethnic groups are also evolving in new
ways. Technology and the media have an enormous impact on law and
justice, which are called upon to carry out very demanding tasks. The
traditional theory of the sources of law has to be largely
re-examined, and many issues of rights are at stake. A part of the
congress will be devoted to reports on the current state of research
in legal and social philosophy in different countries or cultural
areas.

Distinguished lecturers will address the topics characterizing the
main sessions:
- Rights and Other Legal Protections
- New Forms of Sovereignty and Citizenship
- New and Ancient Sources of Law
- Law and Technology
Parallel sessions, symposia and workshops will provide a comprehensive
coverage of these main themes.

The 17th IVR World Congress will consider including one or more
workshops dedicated to the reciprocal influences of technology and
law, with particular reference to the field of computer science.
The exponential growth of large-scale, international computer network
poses new relevant legal problems, from copyright to privacy to
computer crimes; new network services aid law scholars and
professionals in their job; advanced AI research finds in the law
domain interesting topics of study; the large masses of legal
documents require innovative paradigms for handling, storing and
retrieving data: information retrieval, hypertext and advanced data
bases are interesting candidates.

Contributions are welcome on the following suggested topics and others
that may be considered interesting. A partial list of subjects is:
- legal issues in international networks
- artificial intelligence and law
- hypertext for law
- legal databases and information retrieval systems
- privacy and technology
- computer crimes

Authors are invited to send statements of interest and submit
abstracts of possible papers by AUGUST 31, 1994. Further
suggestions of other topics, possible speakers, and possible
demostrations of relevant products needs to be received no later than
JUNE 30, 1994 to the address below. Please note that, in order to
speed the processing of messages, all correspondence should have
"IVR 95" as part of the subject.

Forwarded message:
From--gnu@eff.org (John Gilmore)
Subject-- URGENT-- Please Tell Congress to Allow Encryption Export

        House Intelligence Committee holds key to Crypto Export
         ask@eff.org     June 9, 1994      *DISTRIBUTE WIDELY*

Today, the U.S. State Department controls the export of most
encryption, working closely with the National Security Agency (NSA) to
limit products that provide real privacy, from cell-phones to PC
software.  A bill introduced by Rep. Maria Cantwell would instead give
authority over non-military crypto exports to the Commerce Department.
Commerce has much more reasonable regulations, with "First
Amendment"-style unlimited publishing of publicly available software,
including PGP, Kerberos, RIPEM, RSAREF, and mass-market commercial
software.  The bill also prevents the Commerce Dept. from tightening
the regulations even if NSA somehow gets its tentacles into Commerce.

A few months ago, you-all sent over 5600 messages to Rep. Cantwell in
support of her bill, H.R. 3627.  As a result, on May 18, the bill
passed the House Foreign Affairs Committee by being incorporated into
the Export Administration Act of 1994, H.R. 3937.

Now the battle has become more intense.  This portion of H.R. 3937 has
been referred to the House Intelligence Committee with the intent to
kill or severely maim it.  We need your help again, to urge the
Intelligence Committee to keep crypto export liberalization intact.

The House and Senate Intelligence Committees, the only watchdogs for
the NSA, tend to follow the agency's wishes when they wave the magic
"national security" wand.  They need plenty of input from the public
that tells them that the nation will be *more* secure with good
encryption, even though the NSA will be less happy.

Not just computer users, but all users of telephones, cable TV, health
care, and credit information systems would benefit from this change.
The security of these applications is built on the foundation laid by
the operating systems and network protocols on which they run.  If
this bill is passed, you will see high quality encryption built into
Microsoft Windows, into the MacOS, into major Unix workstations, into
the Internet, into cellular phones, into interactive television.  The
software already exists for confidentiality, privacy, and security of
local and networked information, but it's not built-in to these
systems because of the export ban.  Today, each company could build
two operating systems, one gutted for international use, but this
would be costly and confusing for them and their customers, and would
not allow international networks such as the Internet or telephones to
be made secure and private.  With this bill, these limits disappear.

Furthermore, the Clinton Administration plans to permit high volume
exports of Clipper products, while continuing to require tedious
paperwork for truly secure encryption products.  The bill would give
Clipper and other crypto software more even-handed treatment.

The bill also eliminates a senseless situation on the Internet.
Today, crypto software can only be freely distributed from non-U.S.
archive sites.  It would eliminate that problem as well as the threat
of prosecution against U.S. freeware authors of crypto software.

This is the dream we've all been working toward.  Here's how you can
help to make this dream a reality.  The Intelligence Committee must
make its decision on the bill before June 17, so time is critical:

1) Fax a short letter TODAY to the chair of the Intelligence
Committee, Representative Dan Glickman (D-KS).  Ask him in your own
words to leave the encryption provisions of H.R. 3937 intact.  Use a
positive tone ("Please support...") rather than a flame or a rant.
One paragraph is fine.  State your title and organization if you will
look more important or better informed than the average citizen.  Rep.
Glickman's committee fax number is +1 202 225 1991.  This is the best
option, since individual letters are given the most weight by members
of Congress, particularly when sent on letterhead paper.

2) If you are unable to fax a letter, send an e-mail message to Rep.
Glickman at glickman@eff.org.  Software or staff at the Electronic
Frontier Foundation will either fax it in, or print it out and
hand-deliver it for you.

3) Send a copy of this message to everyone you know in Kansas, and
personally urge them to write to Rep. Glickman today.  Letters from
constituents get a lot more weight, since they are from people who
could actually vote for or against him in the next election.

4) If your own Representative is on the Intelligence Committee, send
him or her a copy of what you sent Rep. Glickman.  There's a list of all
such Reps. below.  Even if we lose this battle, you will have started
educating your own Rep. about crypto policy.

5) Become a member of EFF.  Our strength comes from our members' strength.
Send a note to membership@eff.org asking how to join.

Thanks again for your help!  You can check at any time on the current
status of the campaign at the location below.  Send any comments on
this campaign to campaign@eff.org.
