Subject: File 1--Review of Charles Platt's ANARCHY ONLINE

ANARCHY ONLINE. By Charles Platt. New York: Black Sheep Books.
368 pp. $24.95 (cloth).

Those wishing to understand the history, development, and
background of the "computer underground" generally refer to Cliff
Stoll's THE CUCKOO'S EGG, Katie Hafner and John Markoff's
CYBERPUNK, and Bruce Sterling's HACKER CRACKDOWN as among the
most useful.  Now, Platt's ANARCHY ONLINE joins this select set.

Unlike the other volumes, which use the story of legal
entanglements to organize the information in chronological
sequence, Platt provides a smorgasbord of narratives covering
topics (piracy, net porn), politics (legislative battles), law
(suits and prosecutions), personalities (pick your favorite),
events, movements, and history.

Dividing his material into two sections, "Newcrime" and
"NetSpeech," Platt offers the reader nearly 100 narratives mixed
with rich description, occasional political commentary, and a
dose of social critique as way of describing salient issues in
Cyberspace.

His introductory chapter of "A typical hacker bust" describes in
a few pages the apprehension of the "dreaded Hollywood Hacker,"
whose home was raided in 1990 by law enforcement agents, guns
drawn with a television crew in tow, for the heinous crime of
"borrowing" an acquaintance's password and logging into a
computer account without authorization.  Although the "Hollywood
Hacker's" offense was trivial, the incident illustrates the
abysmal lack of familiarity of computer technology and "hacking"
by law enforcement agents.  It also provides Platt with an
effective entry point into the emergence of the "computer
underground."

With Platt as our tour guide, our journey through the underground
includes a panorama of "hacker BBSes, some we see from afar, some
from the inside. Occasionally, we stop long enough to meet former
"hackers" ("Dark Phiber," "Lord Digital," "Dead Lord," "Seth")
and "hacker"-chasing agents (Scott Charney); Security wizards
(Crypto-guru Phil Zimmermann, Dan Farmer, Robert Steele, the
original "agent Steele" of CIA, not "hacking," fame, as federal
agents learned to their confused embarrassment at a CFP
conference several years ago); and an array of Net personalities.

Platt provides information from  Kevin Mitnick's some-time
partner "Roscoe," who suggests that much of the personal
information in CYBERPUNK was a spoof concocted by Mitnick and
"Roscoe." He examines how state laws have curtailed Net
liberties.  He brings back names from the past, including Lorne
Shantz, Bob Emerson, and Jake Baker.  Martin Rimm returns in a
scathing section that describes his "Netporn study" and Mike
Godwin's perseverance in destroying the credibility of both the
study and the author.

Particularly interesting are the dozens of photographs of
previously faceless Net personalities.  Hackers, law enforcement
agents, and others ranging from Cyberporn protagonists Philip
Elmer-Dewitt/Martin Rimm and Godwin/Donna Hoffman; Anti-indecency
warrior Cyberangel Colin (Gabriel) Hatcher and free-speech
advocate Declan McCullagh; Joel Furr (sans t-shirt); and many,
many others.

Given Platt's literary and extensive writing background, it's not
surprising that ANARCHY ONLINE is exceptionally well written, and
while he on occasion seems tempted to move into political
polemics, he is generally successful in pulling back.  Given the
magnitude of detail he presents, his accuracy is impressive,
perhaps because he took pains to contact many of his subjects
before publication to review his commentary.

Readers who prefer extended symphonies to short riffs and three
minute air-play routines might find the staccato style of brief
tastes and images frustrating (Platt, I should mention, never
mixes metaphors). But, the breadth and detail of this volume
makes it well worth reading, and it will prove an invaluable
reference source. And, it's currently reasonably priced.

The is one problem with obtaining the book.  ANARCHY ONLINE's
hardcover edition is available by mail order only.

FOR *CREDIT CARD ORDERS ONLY* DIAL 1-800-879-4214.

Cover price is $24.95. BUT netizens get almost a 50 percent
discount! If you say "I heard about it through the Internet" you
pay only $12.95 (plus shipping).

Extracts from the book are freely available for inspection at
http://charlesplatt.com

The paperback will be out next March from HarperCollins and will
be distributed through regular bookstores. (But it will probably
cost more than $12.95).
It would make a great Christmas present or, better, a
supplemental text for the classroom.

           Maverick Security Expert Advocates
           Government Intervention to Secure the Internet

           Robert Steele spent most of his working life in various
      sections of the government bureaucracy until, at the age of
      forty-two, he finally decided to go it alone. "I was deputy
      director at the Marine Corps Intelligence Center," he says,
      relaxing on the couch in the comfortable, traditionally
      furnished living room of his home, which is nestled in wooded
      country in Oakton, Virginia. With nicely bound books, a
      couple of antique clocks, and elegant furniture, it's a
      peaceful refuge within easy reach of his former employers at
      the CIA, and no more than an hour's drive from the center of
      Washington, D.C. But there is nothing peaceful or genteel
      about Steele himself.
           "I had spent eighteen years as a professional
      intelligence officer," he says, "and discovered that a whole
      lot of classified data wasn't really there. We just had a
      whole bunch of facts about Soviet missile silos. Nothing on
      the Third World, for instance. At the Marine Corps
      Intelligence Center we were spending $3 million a year on a
      system for accessing classified data from the CIA, NSA
      [National Security Agency], and DIA [Defense Intelligence
      Agency]--and I found that for $25,000 a year I could get
      better data from open sources."
           By "open sources" he means academic studies, published
      papers, books, and databases accessible by private citizens
      via the Internet, with no security clearance necessary.
           "In 1992," Steele continues in an abrasive, rapid-fire
      style, "I had made open sources a policy issue at
      congressional level by working with Hill staffers who then
      forced Bob Gates, director of Central Intelligence [DCI], to
      set up an open-sources task force to review how he did things
      and come up with recommendations for improving them."
           Disgusted by the report that resulted, Stele quit and
      decided to go it alone. He started sponsoring his own
      conferences, the first of which was hugely successful.
           Among the speakers were the chief of staff of the
      Defense Intelligence Agency, a former science advisor to the
      President, and the deputy director of the CIA. Attendees
      included people from the intelligence community, John Perry
      Barlow (cofounder of the Electronic Frontier Foundation), and
      an assortment of hackers. The event gave Steele instant
      notoriety. "I became a public figure," he says.
           Encouraged by his successes, he became more ambitious.
      "My vision expanded," he says. "I wanted to help the American
      economy make better use of open sources. I became concerned
      with information security. Finally it seemed to me that the
      only answer was to devise and implement a national
      information strategy. I'm hoping that Gingrich or Gore is
      going to use that phrase--"national information strategy"--in
      a speech within the next two months, because I'm working with
      various staffers on the Hill and in the administration whom I
      really respect. My ideas are bipartisan."
           Even though Steele became personally disillusioned with
      his area of government, he still sees government policy as
      the only way of taming anarchy online and safeguarding
      systems from intruders.
           "The role of government is to inform the citizenry about
      security problems that exist," he says. "Then it can
      establish standards to which the computer industry can rise."
           But why is a government policy needed? Why can't this
      problem be tackled by private industry?
           "The communications and computing industries have been
      criminally negligent, have not been held to any standards of
      adequate engineering. If we don't have a national information
      strategy that provides standards and due diligence law, we
      will never be able to protect ourselves. The first
      fundamental step is that our nation as a whole must be
      committed to communications security."
           I'm beginning to feel stuck in government-speak. What
      exactly does he mean by due diligence?
           "Due diligence is defined by regulation. Right now there
      is no due diligence requirement for communications and
      computing security. Stockholders are being screwed. They
      don't realize it, but they're paying a price for corporate
      management not protecting proprietary information properly.
      There's no law, no regulations, and no public perception." He
      pauses for emphasis. "This, I think, is the most fundamental
      single weakness in this nation."
           There's not a hint of doubt in Steele, and not a lot of
      false modesty, either. In 1994 he wrote a bill that was
      introduced in the Senate to establish his national
      information strategy, which would be managed by a chief
      information officer to be appointed by the Vice President.
      Steele would have liked Paul Strassman to hold that position.
      For himself he thought that a suitable title might be
      director of national intelligence, with a subordinate
      director of classified intelligence and a subordinate
      coordinator for public information who would also be director
      of a national information foundation that would encourage the
      free flow and accessibility of data through the nation. The
      whole package was supposed to cost half a billion dollars in
      the first year, rising to two billion in the fourth year and
      maintaining that level thereafter.
           The bill, of course, was never signed into law, and
      Steele admits that it had "zero impact." I suggest to him
      that the cost of it alone made it impractical, but he waves
      aside that objection. "If you're not talking in billions, no
      one takes you seriously. When you have trillion-dollar
      federal budgets, a program worth less than a billion is not
      significant because it's not going to have an impact on the
      nation as a whole.
           "The typical computer network," he goes on, "isn't like a
      house with windows, doors, and locks. It's more like a gauze
      tent encircled by a band of drunk teenagers with lit
      matches."
           At the same time, though, he still insists that hackers
      are not a cause for concern. "It is clear that eighty percent
      of bad things happening to computers are being done by
      authorized users doing unauthorized things. This was the
      conclusion reached by the Department of Defense during a one-
      year study. Hackers are just our warning signal, the sneeze
      that tells you you have a cold. Hackers are not a threat.
      Ignorance is the greatest threat. The individual, the
      organization, the nation that doesn't understand its
      electronic vulnerabilities is essentially placing itself at
      risk."
           Once again he stresses the need for a national policy to
      establish security standards. In the meantime, while we're
      waiting for government to implement his vision, he's scathing
      about institutions that don't take proper steps to protect

                    Pirate Boards: A Vanishing Species

           Only a few pirates still deal in warez--just for the fun
      of it. In the following case history, the pirate's real name
      has been changed at his request.
           "My handle was Axeman," says Mike Wollenski. "I used to
      run a BBS called the GrindStone. I started it when I was
      fifteen. It was a good ol' boys board, meaning that it only
      served people I knew by reputation, or personally. I had one
      phone lineand eighty megs of storage."
           According to Mike, he never charged anyone for
      membership or downloads. The operation was just a hobby.
      "Making money off stolen software is a fantastic way to have
      the feds come gunning after your ass," he says.
           The board ran without trouble for three years, serving a
      maximum of 150 users. In 1994 Mike went to college and set up
      a new version of his BBS from there. Still there were no
      problems, even though he was now dealing more heavily in
      stolen software. "I got back into the pirate scene big time,"
      he says. "I loved getting uploads, especially uploads that
      were less than three days old. I used to have a contact at
      IBM who would be able to get us the latest OS/2 beta source
      codes for device drivers and utilities. He'd send it up and
      some guys would download it and it would spread from there."
           At Christmas break, Mike moved the BBS back home again
      and took things one notch farther. "Right around this time,"
      he recalls, "in my AC [area code], 914, an interest in
      H/P/V/C/A started." H/P/V/C/A stands for Hacking, Phreaking,
      Viruses, Cracking (or Carding, depending on who you ask), and
      Anarchy. "Me, being the information hound that I was, decided
      to join a mail network called MOBNet."
           This was an informal store-and-forward message system.
      Mike would accumulate a bunch of BBS messages or other data,
      reduce their size with a file compression utility such as
      PKZip, then pass them to another BBS. He received material on
      the same basis.
           "On a good day," says Mike, "I would get in a couple
      hundred mes-sages, all dealing with hacking into systems, how
      to crack password files on Unix hosts, how and where to find
      credit card numbers, and, more importantly, how to protect
      yourself from these things happening to you. So here I was, a
      pirate board in 914--rather successful, as far as this area
      code goes--getting pretty new files, and a ton of information
      daily about the `darker sciences.'"
           On Christmas Eve Mike received a warning. "I get a call
      from a friend of mine, telling me, `Dude, shut it down! Kill
      it! Nuke everything, and close everything up! Some kid just
      got popped for credit card fraud, and he's telling the cops
      that he got it from you.' Needless to say, I freaked. I
      immediately took it down."
           Foolishly, though, after a couple of days he put
      everything back online. A couple more days after that, he was
      raided.
           "I'd been to the movies with my younger brother and a
      friend of ours from school. I think it was at ten-thirty or
      so. On our way back to my house, the car phone rings.
      Understand, it was my parents' car; I had to raid the change
      bin for the money to see the movie. My bro picks it up, says,
      `Yeah? Uh-huh. Hmmm. Uh . . . okay. Bye.' He turns to me and
      says, rather loudly, `You're going to jail! The cops came
      over to the house with a search warrant and took your
      computer and stuff. Mom and Dad are pissed!'"
           When Mike got home he found that state police had taken
      his 486SX/33 IBM-compatible computer, the monitor, keyboard,
      modem, mouse, and all his software--"including the stuff I
      had bought!" he says with a tone of wounded disbelief. "They
      also took most of my parents' software. They tried to take my
      mom's computer as well; I gather yelling ensued, and that
      computer never left the house."
           Mike was only a few days over eighteen. The police
      promised that if he cooperated, he'd be charged as a
      juvenile, there would be no felony charges, and his identity
      would be kept secret. This sounded like a good deal, so he
      supplied the password to unlock his system.
           According to Mike, the cops then proceeded to betray
      him. In February 1995 a local newspaper ran a two-part
      article on hacking in which Mike was the only person
      identified under his real name. A few months later, when Mike
      came home from the spring college semester, he found himself
      charged as an adult, with two class-E felonies carrying more
      than ten years of potential jail time. He was horrified. "In
      the end," he says, "my lawyer talked them down to a
      violation--disorderly conduct--with a $250 fine and twenty-
      five hours community service. But I had been so worried about
      the case, I couldn't finish my semester at school. The cops
      had lied to me outright in front of me and my lawyer, so I
      had no idea what they were going to do next, and I basically
      panicked."
           He regrets now that he cooperated. "I should have told
      them to go fuck themselves silly. But I gave them access to
      my files, and because of that, a good friend of mine also got
      busted. For all I know he went to jail; I don't really want
      to know."
           The main reason for police action against Mike's board
      was not the software but the file containing credit card
      numbers. "Most of them I got from a friend," he says, "but
      some of them came from carbon copies in trash bins outside
      the mall. It's easy to get them; you just go down there at
      two A.M. when all the rent-a-cops are enjoying their
      doughnuts."
           He insists, however, he had no interest in the numbers.
      "Once I had them--okay, great, now what? I never used any of
      'em, because I have parents. They are better than any credit
      card I know of. I don't have to pay interest, I don't have a
      spending limit--hell, I don't even have to pay them back! So
      did I sell card numbers? No. Did I give them to people? No.
      Were they available if people left a message on my board?
      Yes. Just like they are available anywhere else in life. What
      it comes down to is that I was busted because I let people do
      what they wished with my hard-drive space. I think that what
      people did with my board was their own business. The police
      came in and violated that right."
           Mike's parents imposed some limits for a while: no modem
      usage, and he had to ask permission to make phone calls.
      Eventually he got his computer system back from the police--
      everything except the hard drive--and computers are still his
      main interest. He's hoping to make a career out of them as a
      network technician.
           Meanwhile, he says, pirate boards are scarcer than ever.
      "After I was busted, all the local boards disappeared. As far
      as I know, there's only one board left in 914. There are
      still boards in other areas with a couple thousand people on
      'em, but most are in the Midwest, where people are naturally

%T   "NetLaw:  Your Rights in the Online World"

Very similar to his earlier "Syslaw" (cf. BKSYSLAW.RVW), this is
a general guide to various legal aspects of life online.  The
major changes are the broadening of the scope from BBS level
systems to include online services and the Internet, and very
handy (and interesting) sidebars, which give a thumbnail sketch
version of the topic under discussion.  These usually include a
reference to some specific case.

Chapters address the issues of censorship, contracts, commerce,
and copyright.  Chapter four, which deals with the responsibility
of the system operator in light of online dangers, does touch on
the topic of malicious software.  I was disappointed that this is
limited to a not terribly accurate defining of terms, and almost
no discussion of the admittedly confused legal situation.
Further chapters cover privacy, crime, search and seizure, and a
rather disappointing chapter on obscenity.  Appendices include
some very useful sample contracts, and various US laws.

Given recent developments which have strongly indicated the
international nature of the net and international legal
ramifications, it is discouraging to see that Rose still presents
only a limited and US-centric view.  However, the general
principles he describes are held in common law, and this book
should at least provide guidance for the broader online world.

Sebastopol, CA, October 28, 1996 - O'Reilly & Associates, a leading
Internet software developer and book publisher, has announced that it

Internet and intranet business applications. O'Reilly's award-winning
WebSite 1.1(TM), heralded for its features, ease of use and

links on the server. WebSite features a graphical interface for
creating virtual servers, server side includes (SSI), and a framework
which significantly improves the speed and efficiency of working with
spreadsheets, databases, and other programs  in environments such as

        "BUILDING AN INDUSTRIAL STRENGTH WEB" IS FOCUS OF
              ISSUE 4 OF THE "WORLD WIDE WEB JOURNAL"

SEBASTOPOL, CA--The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) and O'Reilly &
Associates announce the publication of Issue 4 of the "World Wide Web
Journal." This issue focuses on the infrastructure needed to create and
maintain an "Industrial Strength Web," from network protocols to
application design. Over a year ago, the http protocol on the Web
surpassed the file transfer protocol as the largest application load on
the Internet. As a result, Internet performance is crumbling in many
locations, network addresses are being consumed at a prodigious rate,
and the extraordinary popularity of a handful of pages is crowding out
the rest of the Web. This issue takes a detailed look at the
technology--present and future--that's required to scale the Web to
work for millions of hosts, tens of millions of users, and billions of
pages.

The papers in this issue shed light on these challenges, and offer
state-of-the-art remedies. The "W3C Reports" section features papers
from two workshops: the Joint W3C/OMG Workshop on Distributed Objects
and Mobile Code and the Meeting on Distributed AW..
