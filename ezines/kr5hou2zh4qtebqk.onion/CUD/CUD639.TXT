Subject: File 1--Having Problems Receiving CuD on the Mailing List?

If you've requested a mail subscription to CuD and have received
acknowledgement of the request but have received no CuDs since, it
means that the your address is part of a small distribution problem
affecting about 8 percent of the list.

To rectify the problem, drop a one-line note that says:

SEPARATE LIST         in the subject header
and in the one-line message:  SEPARATE LIST  <your.full@address.etc>

We *STRONLY* prefer that readers obtain CuD from the Usenet group
comp.society.cu-digest

The ftp sites (see addresses in the header) are also easy ways to
obtain CuD for those with ftp access.

The mailing list constitutes only about two percent of the readership,
but is sufficiently large (3,500) that maintaining the list is rather
labor-intensive.

              "CLIPPER" PETITION DELIVERED TO WHITE HOUSE

         COMPUTER USERS CALL ON ADMINISTRATION TO DROP ENCODING PLAN

                     NEW PRIVACY CENTER ESTABLISHED

Washington, DC -- A national public interest organization today
delivered to the White House a petition asking for withdrawal of the
controversial Clipper cryptography proposal.  The Clipper plan would
provide government agents with copies of the keys used to encoded
electronic messages.

The petition was signed by more than 47,000 users of the nation's data
highway.  The petition drive occurred entirely across the Internet.
It is the largest electronic petition to date.

Earlier this year, the White House announced support for the Clipper
proposal.  But the plan has received almost unanimous criticism from
the public.  A Time/CNN found that 80% of the American public opposed
Clipper.

Computer Professionals for Social Responsibility began the petition
drive in January.  In the letter addressed to the President, the
organization said that if Clipper goes forward, "privacy protection
will be diminished, innovation will be slowed, government
accountability will be lessened, and the openness necessary to ensure
the successful development of the nation's communications
infrastructure will be threatened."

The petition asks for the withdrawal of Clipper.  It is signed by many
of the nation's leading cryptographers including Whitfield Diffie,
Martin Hellman, and Ronald Rivest.  Users from nearly 3,000  different
sites across the Internet are represented.  Responses came from more
than 1300 companies including Microsoft, IBM, Apple, DEC, GE, Cray,
Tandem, Sun, SGI, Mead Data Central, AT&T, and Stratus. Signatures
also came from more than 850 colleges and universities and 150
non-profit organizations. Many responses came from public networks
such as  America Online and Compuserve. Nearly a thousand came from
government and military sites including NASA, the Army and the Navy.

Next week hearings will be held in Congress on the controversial
cryptography proposal, an initiative developed by the FBI and the
National Security Agency.  Most of the witnesses are expected to
testify against the plan.

In a related development, the establishment of the Electronic Privacy
Information Center was announced today.  EPIC is jointly sponsored by
CPSR and the Fund for Constitutional Government. It will focus on
emerging privacy issues surrounding the information data highway.

Subject: File 3--"Child Abuse in Cyberspace" (Newsweek story)

((MODERATORS' NOTE: A recent Newsweek article dramatizing
Net-pedophile predators conflates pornography, pedophilia, and child
porn to create an over-dramatized fright piece. Readers of the full
article, of which we only summarize below, will note that it is short
on fact, long on inference)).

"Child Abuse in Cyberspace: Police target on-line pedophiles"
NEWSWEEK, April 18, 1994 (p. 40)
By Barbara Kantrowitz (with Patricia King and Debra Rosenberg)

The story begins with a description of a Chelmsford, Mass., BBS sysop,
John Rex, Jr, a 23 year-old engineering student.  Police found two pet
pythons, 3,000 arms of ammunition, explosives, bomb manuals, and 43
videotapes, "many of them either pornographic or about child
molesters."

     Prosecutors charge that Rex used his network to recruit
     teenagers who could help hm abduct a small boy.
     Officials say Rex wanted to sexually abuse the
     child--and possibilty kill and eat him.  According to
     chilling details recorded in court papers, a teenager
     says that Rex told him that he almost grabbed a child
     himself at a New Hampshire mall recently when he saw a
     small boy going into a bathroom alone.  Last week Rex
     pleaded not guilty to various child-abuse and
     pornography charges; he is being held on $2 million
     surety bail.

Although the computer links to the above incident seem minimal,
the story quotes law enforcement officials who warn of
pedophiles on the nets. Without supporting evidence or anecdotes,
the story claims:

     Many of the young victims are latchkey kids, home alone all
     afternoon with only a computer screen for company.

The story continues with the case of Donald Deatherage, 27, of
Cupertino, Calif. Deatherage, known as "HeadShaver" on America Online,
was accused by police of using his computer to prey on a 14-year old
boy with whom he had struck up an on-line conversation. Deatherage was
accused of eventually meeting the youth, handcuffing, shackling, and
blindfolding him, and spanking him with a leather belt (among other
more serious acts).  The story alludes to "Operation Longarm," last
year's US Custom's raid of 35 alleged U.S. computer users who were
downloading child pornography from Sweden. The authors also allude to
the ease by which youth can obtain pornography, and claim that police
are "technologically outgunned" in the battle against electronic
pedophiles.

Perhaps Net pedophiles are more common that we believe. But,
judging from actual instances, it's rare. Although we strongly
advocate alerting parents to on-line dangers that children face,
we oppose the hyperbole that passes for "news" in the major
media.
The paucity and twisting of facts presented in the Newsweek story and
the linking of pedophiles and "pornography" reflect the hysterical
image-making that passes of "journalism" among much of the media.

The authors do conclude with one final point that CuD has emphasized
in the past:  Parents should be made aware of dangers of all kinds in
cyberspace and educate their children accordingly.

                  NEW PRIVACY CENTER ESTABLISHED

                   EPIC TO MONITOR DATA HIGHWAY

WASHINGTON, DC --  A new organization was launched today to address
growing public concerns about privacy protection for the national
information infrastructure.  The Electronic Privacy Information Center
(EPIC) will focus on emerging threats to personal privacy.

Among the threats are the government's controversial Clipper computer
encryption proposal, which has caused widespread protests from
companies and computer users around the world.  Proposals for an
information superhighway and recent plans to reform the nation's
health care system also involve significant threats to personal
privacy.

"We have established EPIC to focus public attention on these new
privacy issues -- the Clipper Chip, the Digital Telephony Proposal,
medical record privacy, and the sale of consumer data." said Marc
Rotenberg, director of EPIC.

A 1993 poll by the Lou Harris organization found 80 percent of
Americans concerned about threats to their privacy.  More than two
thirds believe they have lost all control over personal information.
Still, 70 percent believe that privacy is a fundamental right
comparable to "life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness," and a
clear majority of Americans favor establishment of a privacy agency
within the government.

EPIC brings together an unprecedented group of experts from computer
science, information law, civil liberties, human rights, public
interest advocacy, library and research communities, as well as
privacy experts and scholars. Among the members of the EPIC Advisory
Board is former Congressman and Presidential candidate John B.
Anderson.  Mr. Anderson said today at a Capitol Hill press conference
he was very pleased by the establishment of the new organization.

"Privacy is one of the bedrock American values.  EPIC will help ensure
that privacy is protected in the information age," said Mr. Anderson.

Simon Davies, the Director General of Privacy International, welcomed
the launch of EPIC. Speaking from London, England today he said,
"EPIC is an exciting initiative on the leading edge of privacy
protection. My hope is that EPIC will be the forerunner of many such
organizations around the world."

EPIC is a joint project of the Fund for Constitutional Government and
Computer Professionals for Social Responsibility.  FCG is a non-profit
charitable organization established in 1974 to protect civil liberties
and constitutional rights.  CPSR is a national membership organization
established in 1982 by professionals in the computing field concerned
about the social impact of computer technology.

WHEN EMAILING NOTES TO LEGISLATORS, SEND THE VERY BEST

When sending emailed support or opposition statements to state or federal
legislators, please be sure to make them reasonably formal and be sure to
include your name, title, organization-if-any, snailmail address and
voice-phone.  Reasons:

Your statements - especially those sent to a bill-author indicating your
*support* - will typically be printed out and distributed in a packet to
other legislators and their staff who will next be considering the bill in
which you are interested.

In the case of statements *opposing* a bill ... hmmm, it'd be best to send
them to a legislator known to be opposing the bill.  Less chance for them to
be, uh, misplaced, and a greater chance for them to be circulated to other
key legislators and staffers.

CONTACT LIST OF MEMBERS OF CONGRESS, PLUS GOVT-REFORM FILES, ALL BY FTP

From: Char Roberts <croberts@crl.com>

Jim, I have a list of the members of the 103rd Congress, their states, party
affiliation, phone and fax numbers on my personal ftp site which I have made
available to other groups already.  It is from the Jan. 1993 US Congress
Yellow Book but has been gradually updated as people send in corrections for
their own congresscritters. ...
Please feel free to advertise the location in the GovAccess newsletter.
Note that my ftp site is read-only, so anything which is put there has to
be e-mailed to me first.  Also please note that I have LIMITED storage so I
am not embarrassed to be quite dictatorial about what goes there! (I also
remove stuff whenever it has become stale in my own humble opinion!). I'm
using my ftp site mostly for government-reform related files. Usually the
file names are self-explanatory. Feel free to browse. The congresscritter
list I have is called congfone.txt.

GOPHER AND TELNET ACCESS TO CALIFORNIA LEGISLATIVE INFORMATION
  From watkins@scilibx.UCSC.EDU Thu Apr  7 09:04:09 1994
From: Steve Watkins <watkins@scilibx.UCSC.EDU>

some of the items mentioned in past postings are also
already available via InfoSlug (the guide to retrieving legislative
information, for instance).  The InfoSlug Gopher server is at
gopher.ucsc.edu  for those who have access to their own Gopher clients,
but we also offer open access via Telnet to  infoslug.ucsc.edu  using
infoslug  as the login.  This might be an easier way for people to get at
some of these files rather than having to FTP them.

EFFORTS TO OPEN UP NEW YORK STATE'S LEGISLATIVE INFORMATION
  From: Reg Neale <neale@ee.rochester.edu>
Date: Thu, 7 Apr 94 13:50:24 EDT

At the suggestion of another activist netter, I am writing to you to alert
you to new developments in our effort to get New York State's public
legislative information online. The NY legislature does collect, organize
and maintain computerized legislative information, including text of bills,
member's voting records etc. However, this information is not freely available
to the public. Instead, it is provided to a captive commercial firm which
sells it to special-interest groups, at prices ordinary citizens cannot
afford.
A bill was just introduced in the NY Assembly to make public information
freely and timely available, via "the most-accessible and least-cost
public network" i.e., the Internet. Bill A10035 was referred to the Assembly's
Governmental Operations Committee, where it is certain to die unless there
is a massive input from concerned citizens. Any New Yorkers reading this
should call or write their assemblyperson to urge immediate action on this
bill. It could also be helpful to contact these two individuals:

  Don't just talk, DO SOMETHING.  I'm aware of at least 2 civil-liberties-
favoring state bills that have failed just recently, in both cases due to
lack of public input.  Activism got a bill very similar to this one passed
in CA last year, and it can work in NY too.  See ftp.eff.org: /pub/EFF/Issues/
Activism/* for more info on this type of thing.  If the legislation is
available to us, it will be archived at ftp.eff.org: /pub/EFF/Legislation/

LEAGUE OF WOMEN VOTERS OFFERS ONLINE INFO, BUT INITIALLY ONLY ON COMPU$ERVE
  From fpack@crl.com Sun Apr 10 03:17:10 1994
From: Fran Packard <fpack@crl.com>

Jim, Thought you may be interested to know that the League of Women Voters
of California is conducting an online Election Services project on
CompuServe. It includes asking participants in our message forum to submit
questions for the statewide candidates. In keeping with our traditional
ways of providing information about candiates, all those running for the
same office will receive the same questions.  We're requesting that
the candidates respond in writing and on disk. Their answers will be
posted in the League library (League/Voters CA) in the California forum.

Fran Packard <fpack@crl.com> or <73162.3025@compuserve.com>

[ This is a delightful first step.  But it will *really* be valuable when it's
posted for free global access via the *bit* net - the Internet - in one or
several ftp sites, including permission to freely repost and re-circulate.
While only to CI$, its potential citizen-audience and user-base is severely
limited.  Keep up the good work - and spread it beyond the CI$ elite.  :-)
  By the way, I understand that the state President of the California LWV is
Marlys Robertson, mrobertson@aol.com  .         --jim ]

try to start a similar movement here in SC. ...
Thanks for all you're doing to help restore openness in our governments.
You're making a difference. Keep up the good work.

WHAT OUR FEDERAL LEGISLATORS GET THAT WE CAN'T GET AND WHY
  From glennb7490@aol.com Fri Apr  8 11:20:41 1994
Xxx asked me to send you a copy of a message I sent her. It's
self-explanatory. ...

>... I was talking with my congresscritter's office today ... and
>remembered what ... about the members of the HORs and
>Sinate using our tax money to buy info from LEGI-SLATE.  I
>asked the staffer (a sysop or something) about that.  She said
>that was correct, and that the services they use in that office
>are LEGIS (the in-house system) and the Roll Call AM and PM
>editions.  The sinate uses, I think, LEGI-SLATE.  She didn't know
>how much this costs or if there is any way you or I could track
>legislation without paying a third party.  She told me to go to
>the library and read Congressional Quarterly each week.
>Phhhhtttt. LEGIS is not available for public use because, as
>she said, "someone might use it to get into a congressman's
>computer". Balderdash. I tried to explain to her that I
>appreciated the need for a secure system, but that didn't
>preclude the public's right to access info directly so that we
>can keep an eye on things without paying expensive thirds
>parties for what is OUR stuff.  She stuck to her guns about
>security, but promised to look into the subject and call me
>next week to let me know what, if anything, can be done to
>allow us to track bills via computer.  I'm writing her a letter
>telling her about the legislation introduced in CA and MN which
>opens these state governments to public access. I think I'll
>also send a couple of interesting addresses to her while I'm at
>it.  NASA and the White Sands Missle Range ought to do it.  They
>need security, but not so much that we can't get SOME info out
>of their computers.  Do you have any addresses that would
>impress her?  FBI or CIA or IRS?  ...

[To which the recipient responded:]

... What a hoot! Some evil taxpayer might use LEGIS to hack
a congressman's computer!  Yes, indeed, we must make the U.S.
government and every legislator SECURE from the constituents!  I
wish I could give you a list of addresses which would singe
that staffer's eyebrows - how about the CIA World Fact Book?
Nah.  There's a listserver for NATO data... Nah.  There's
president@whitehouse.gov... Hah!  That's the one I got into a
flap with over the altered documents they put there.  Not too
impressive.  Actually, there is a lot of government information
all over the Internet but most of it seems to be in university
archives.  The country's college political science and economics
departments don't seem too worried about "security."

... I'd like you to send [GovAccess] the story you
just sent me. I honestly don't know whether to laugh or cry!  ...

[ As to addresses illustrating that perhaps Members of Congress would remain
safe even if the public had Internet access to the public's Congressional
information, how about  dockmaster.ncsc.mil (the National Security Agency's
public Internet host)?  Or maybe even  hr.house.gov  via which 16 House
Members and two House committees have public Internet addresses?    --jim]

For the next 3 Situations, pretend that you are a bystander
directly observing each situation.  When answering, please try to
think about how you would react, feel, and behave as a bystander in
each situation.

                                  SITUATION 1

One of your friends is a technical whiz and has just developed a
new data encryption device (i.e. similar to a phone scrambler the
device helps to protect conversations against wiretapping) and
software.  Your friend quickly demonstrates how the device works by
sending an encrypted message to you.  Your subsequent decoding
efforts fail, illustrating that the encryption device does its job
very well.  You and your friend then proceed to install this device
and software on both of your machines for utilisation when
communicating with each other.

[Please circle or mark one code # (e.g., _1_ or "1" or ~1~) or
      enter an absolute value (e.g., # of years) or type your answer
      in CAPITAL LETTERS for each question]

8a.  What do you think about this situation (encrypting your data
      sent/received with a privately developed device & software)?
                                                            Very wrong.... 2
                                                        A little wrong.....1
                                                        Perfectly okay.....0

8b.  Is anyone hurt by what you did?
                                                          No.....0  Yes....1
                           If Yes, Who/Person_______________________________
                                          How_______________________________

8c.  Imagine that you actually saw someone using an encryption
      program he/she developed for data transfer from his/her PC.
      Would you                                          feel bothered.....0
                                                              not care.....1
                                                    think this is good.....2

8d.  Should the person be stopped?                        No.....0  Yes....1

8e.  Should the person be punished?                       No.....0  Yes....1

Suppose you learn about two different countries.  In country A,
people using privately developed encryption devices for computers
are quite common, and in country B, one never uses privately
developed encryption devices.

8f.  Which one of these customs [if either] is bad or wrong?
                                                Both customs are wrong.....3
                                           Country A's custom is wrong.....2
                                           Country B's custom is wrong.....1
                                    Neither one, both customs are okay.....0
-----------------------------------------------------------------
                                  SITUATION 2

One of your friends is a real computer nut and has just written a
new computer virus.  Your friend then proceeds to post the virus
program onto a BB or an electronic newsletter/listserver (EDL).

9a.  What do you think about this situation (posting a computer
virus one wrote onto a BB or EDL)?
                                                            Very wrong.....2

                                          How_______________________________

9c.  Imagine that you actually saw someone posting a virus program
      one wrote onto a BB or EDL.  Would you

                                                    think this is good.....2

9d.  Should the person be stopped?                        No.....0  Yes....1

9e.  Should the person be punished?                       No.....0  Yes....1

Suppose you learn about two different countries.  In country A,
people posting design/programming characteristics of a computer
virus they wrote on a BB or EDL are quite common, and in country B,
one never shares such programming information about a virus one has
created with members of a BB or EDL.

9f.  Which one of these customs [if either] is bad or wrong?
                                                Both customs are wrong.....3
                                           Country A's custom is wrong.....2
                                           Country B's custom is wrong.....1
                                    Neither one, both customs are okay.....0
-----------------------------------------------------------------
                                  SITUATION 3

Your friend has just received a new computer game through an EDL
located abroad.  The game is banned in this country because of its
violence, sexual and racist content.  Your friend tests the game.
Although he/she finds it somewhat disgusting, your friend sends a
copy to another friend abroad, where no regulations exists for
banning the game.  Your friend does not keep a copy of the game.

10a.  What do you think about this situation (send a locally banned
      game to another user abroad where the game is not banned?
                                                            Very wrong.....2

                                          How_______________________________

10c.  Imagine that you actually saw someone send a game banned in
      your country to another user abroad where no such ban exists.
      Would you
                                                         feel bothered.....0
