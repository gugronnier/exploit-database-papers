Subject: File 1--Fort Bragg hacker/spy case shrouded in secrecy

In late October, the Fayetteville Observer-Times started
reporting on the trial of Eric Jenott, a Fort Bragg, NC,
paratrooper accused of spying.

In testimony at a pre-trial hearing on October 23rd, Chief Warrant
Officer Lorenzo Clemmons said Jenott had told him he could
break into an Army communications system three months before
the paratrooper was arrested on spying charges.

Clemmons said Jenott told him in March 1996 that the Army's
Mobile Subscriber Equipment, carried by hummvee and the Army's
equivalent of cellular telephones, computer and fax communications,
"might not be as secure as we think . . . "

Jenott demonstrated the system's weakness to a supervisor who
passed it along to a Major Jerry R. Moore.  Moore met with
Jenott to discuss the weaknesses.  On October 23rd, Jenott's
defense attempted to show that statements the paratrooper made
to investigators not be allowed as evidence since Moore did
not advise Jenott of his rights.

In news already published, Jenott's family said that he gave
an unclassified Internet access code to a friend from China.
The Army maintains Jenott gave secret computer passwords to
a Chinese accomplice, named "Mr. Liu."  At the hearing,
Jenott's lawyer, Tim Dunn, said "Mr. Liu" had left the country
and could not be located.

According the Observer, the Jenott hearings were shrouded in
secrecy.  "During the hearing only a few minutes of testimony
were open.  The hearing was closed to reporters twice when
court wasn't even in session," reads a boxed-out quote from
the 24th October edition of the newspaper.

Security officers for the Army claim some testimony and audiotapes
presented at the hearing contain classified information.

During a period in which Jenott's lawyer questioned Moore over
what he would do if he discovered a soldier had "hacked" into
Army systems, Army prosecution objected maintaining Dunn was
getting into classified information.  More testimony was taken
behind closed doors.

Jenott's court-martial is scheduled to begin on December 9,
according to reports in the Observer.

Subject: File 2--Utah High School Hackers Club

Officials at Bonneville High School in Ogden, Utah are
considering what do with an unofficial "hacking club."  A group
of students calling themselves the "Bonneville Hacking Society"
recently distributed information to other students about how to
break into the schools DOS and AutoCAD computer systems.

A recent editorial in the local paper, The Ogden
Standard-Examiner, points out that disseminating information is
perfectly legal and called for a reasonable response from the
administration: "While we don't in any way condone the activites
of the Bonneville Hacker Society, we do caution school
administrators to view the kids' actions in the proper context.
[...] What they did was, in most respects, stupid and
irresponsible; ...But we should be careful not to overreact in
these kinds of situations."

Subject: File 3--Debate on "Fastfoto" as "a scam"?

In Cu Digest #8.79 you included the following response to my
 post. I have taken the libery of a few resposes of my own
 (starting debate?).

>Dear Sirs,

>In Cu Digest #8.73, you included a note from Slim Simpson,

 warning of  a potential scam of >some sort by a company by a
 Fastfoto of Pomano  Beach, Florida.  In the header the author

 >suggested that he was  unsure of whether it was appropriate for

 the CU-Digest or not, and  >personally I think it was not.

>Obviously Mr. or Ms. Simpson, was frustrated at the inability to lash  out at

 the person who had >spammed their mailbox.

It's Mr.  Why *obviously frustrated*? Why *lash out*? I don't like spam but I
 reply "Please take me off your list." Most do. When people asking me to send
 money have a false e-mail address, no phone number, and no fax number I smell
 scam. I forwarded same to Cu Digest.

> Lately, with more  an more newcomers to the net, I have noticed that one thing

 they seem  to >find out quickly is their supposed right to be spamless, and
 their  little private electronic >domain, called their mailbox.

I am not a newcomer to the net.

>Many of these same people invite advertising material like flyers,  magazines,

 coupons, to their >household door or mailbox on a daily  basis, but never
 confront these advertisers.  Advertising >material  created by the decimation
 of forests, pollution of the environment by  the processing >of such, and
 ending up as filler for our garbage  dumps.

Mine ends up in my woodstove.

> Amazingly only 4% of the recipients will ever be interested  in the message

 that these >advertising materials contain.

>Yet this person will strike out from their armchair, in their little  form of

 civil protest against an >action they do not agree with, in  relative
 obscurity.  Mean while they sit passively while shots >are  fired outside their
 home, children are being abused, homeless people  starve, and guard >the
 sanctity of their mailbox.

Shots *are * fired outside my home. I live on the water and it's duck season.
 But in Summerstown, Ont, Canada, there's no child abuse and no homeless people
 that I know of.
If I hear of any it will be reported.

>The bottom line is they could have just deleted the note, went on  their merry

 way and ignored >the invasion of privacy.  Instead they  chose to track this
 down, and highlight it in some sort of >shroud of  scam and sent it in to
 CU-Digest, after their inability to express  their displeasure to >the
 offending party.

I should ignore *possible* spam; never warn others about it?

>Personally I would accept my mailbox having a few useless nuisance  messages,

 from >recyclable electrons if it meant stopping the  destructive process of our
 current advertising >means.  Maybe it was  not a spam.  Maybe they just left
 their email address off to protect  >themselves from individuals who want to
 stop this method of  advertising  Maybe they thought >they might end up

 >individuals are  communicating with other individuals today.  Maybe they

 should have  added >the word Adult, then their obscurity would make more sense

And maybe they just wanted me to send money.

>There were people who did not like the introduction of the printing  press at

 one time either, >and of course they are no longer living.  I  just think that
 this message was NOT appropriate for >the CU-Digest,  but hopefully will spark
 debate.

You've made your point. And you think that I was so *frustrated* that I had to
 *lash out*. The fact that there was no way to communicate with the company to
 me was suspicious. I don't consider sending Cu Digest a short, ironic, message
 about it is lashing out. And since when is the environment a fit subject for Cu
 Digest? (But, I, for one, am content to let the moderator decide).

Slim Simpson

  >The thousands of people who regularly send a message to someone who  has

 spammed >them, just has to lighten up, and learn how to use some  filtering
 software.  Then maybe >everyone can communicate without  destroying our
 environment.

>This is just my opinion, on recyclable material I might add, :)).

Cypher-Censored
By Declan McCullagh (declan@well.com)

       The cypherpunks mailing list, so legend goes, coalesced around two
   principles: the dissemination of strong encryption and an absolute
   commitment to free speech. It was a kind of crypto-anarchist utopia:
   Here was a place where anonymity was encouraged and PGP-signed
   postings were the norm -- and nobody seemed to be in control.

       That is, until recently, when Dimitri Vulis was given the boot.
   After he refused to stop posting flames, rants and uninspired personal
   attacks, Vulis was summarily removed from the mailing list.

       Now, normally, when someone gets evicted from a mailing list, it
   excites little attention. But here was an ironic -- some would say
   momentous -- event: The list is run, after all, by John Gilmore, the
   EFF cofounder, a cypherpunk god who is famous for having once said
   that the Internet interprets censorship as damage and routes around
   it. And it was none other than Gilmore who gave Vulis the boot. The
   shunning of Vulis was "an act of leadership," Gilmore said.

       Thus began a debate over what the concept of censorship means in a
   forum devoted to opposing it. Did Gilmore have the right to show Vulis
   the virtual door? Or should he have let the ad hominem attacks
   continue, encouraging people to set their filters accordingly? The
   incident raises deeper questions about how a virtual community can
   prevent one person from ruining the forum for all and whether only
   government controls on expression can be called "censorship."

        Vulis, a 31-year old Russian emigre who completed a PhD in
   mathematics last year at the City University of New York, is described
   as sociable, even friendly, by people who have met him. Online,
   though, he's almost notorious. His .sig file, for instance, proudly
   points out that he's a former Kook of the Month; Vulis was also a
   Net-legend and even has the alt.fan.dimitri-vulis newsgroup named
   after him.

       Vulis portrays himself as a victim, but as I posted to the list
   last week, I disagree. Anyone who's spent any time on the
   100-plus-messages-a-day list can read for themselves the kind of nasty
   daily messages that came from Vulis's keyboard. The list is on
   Gilmore's machine and he can do what he wants with it; he can moderate
   the postings, he can censor material, he can shut the whole thing
   down. By kicking off an offending user, a list owner merely exercises
   his property right. There's no government involvement, so the First
   Amendment doesn't apply. And the deleted, disgruntled user is free to
   start his own mailing list with different rules.

       But then the question is whether Gilmore should have exercised
   that right, especially in such an open forum. Again, I think Gilmore's
   actions were justified. Consider inviting someone into your home or
   private club. If your guest is a boor, you might ask him to leave. If
   your guest is an slobbish drunk of a boor, you have a responsibility
   to require him to leave before he ruins the evening of others.

       Eugene Volokh, a law professor at UCLA, runs a number of mailing
   lists and has kicked people off to maintain better editorial control.
   Volokh says that the most valuable publications are those that
   exercise the highest degree of editorial control.

       But what if your private club's express purpose is to cherish free
   speech? That's where the terrain gets mucky. One 'punk wrote: "For
   someone who espouses freedom of speech to arbitrarily censor someone
   is indeed hypocritical." Another called it a "big cypherpunkish move"
   that couldn't be condoned "even bearing in mind the inane and
   wearisome behaviour of Dr. Vulis." Still others said that this
   demonstrated that "libertarianism can't work without some measure of
   authoritarianism." (Libertarianism being the primordial flame war
   topic, the debate nearly consumed itself at this point.)

       Vulis told me yesterday: "I'm particularly disappointed by John
   Gilmore's actions. I've known him and communicated with him before.
   His treatment of me was rude and unprofessional and inappropriate." In
   posts to the mailing list, Vulis levels the additional criticism that
   it was "arbitrary and capricious" and that he was not notified that he
   would be forcibly unsubscribed.

       This week Vulis busied himself by saying that now Gilmore can be
   sued for what happens on cypherpunks, arguing that the list owner is
   exercising greater control and so is subject to greater liability. Of
   course, in this country anyone can sue for anything. But it's highly
   unlikely the suit would go anywhere. Solveig Bernstein, a lawyer with
   the Cato Institute, says: "Chances are in a defamation lawsuit he'd be
   treated like a publisher or bookstore owner.. They exercise some
   control over content and enjoy pretty broad immunity from lawsuits."

       For his part, Gilmore calls removing the Russian mathematician "an
   act of leadership." He says: "It said we've all been putting up with
   this guy and it's time to stop. You're not welcome here... It seemed
   to me that a lot of the posts on cypherpunks were missing the mark.
   They seemed to have an idea that their ability to speak through my
   machine was guaranteed by the Constitution."

       What does Vulis's ouster mean to the community that sprang up
   around this mailing list, of which he had been a member for nearly
   three years? Many of his peers think he did it for attention or
   notoriety; one longtime list-denizen declined to be interviewed for
   fear of encouraging him. (If that's his goal, he's already succeeded.
   Will Rodger from Inter@ctive Week and Lewis Koch from Upside Magazine
   are writing about this.)

       Other cypherpunks wonder why Vulis is abrasive online, yet
   mild-mannered in person; Gilmore likened him to "a Jekyll-and-Hyde
   personality."

       The flap comes at a time when other prominent cypherpunks are
   leaving, citing too many flames and too little content. Perry Metzger,
   another longtime member, announced last month he would start his own,
   moderated mailing list. The hard-core programmers have moved on. Yet
   the list membership has never been higher, at 1,949 direct
   subscribers. And the cyber-rights issues the group discusses have
   never been more important.

       Ironically, tools like anonymous remailers that the cypherpunks
   labored to create now make it impossible to get rid of Vulis
   completely. Blocking posts from remailers is unthinkable to the
   cypherpunks. So the embattled Russian =E9migr=E9 continues to read the
   list under a pseudonym and appears to be posting as frequently as
   ever. But perhaps Gilmore succeeded in part. If not more polite,
   Vulis's messages now are at least on-topic.

(1) PRESIDENT TAKES FIRST STEPS TOWARDS CLIPPER 3.1.1

In a move that leaves major unanswered questions about the privacy of global
communications on the Internet,  President Clinton has taken the first
concrete steps towards implementing the government's controversial key
recovery encryption proposal.  On Friday November 15, the President appointed
an ambassador-level "Special Envoy for Cryptography" and signed an Executive
Order that gives the Commerce Department jurisdiction over encryption exports
but includes the Justice Department in all such export decisions.  These
developments do little to change the underlying regulations on encryption
that have prevented the development of a strong worldwide encryption standard
needed to protect privacy and security on the Internet.

The full text of the executive order and other relevant background materials
are available on CDT's Encryption Policy Page:

     http://www.cdt.org/crypto/

Friday's White House announcements demonstrate the Administration's
commitment to its dangerous key recovery approach to worldwide encryption.
This approach fails to meet the fundamental privacy needs of computer users
and industry because:

*  International communications are still vulnerable since products sold
   by the dominant U.S. hardware and software manufacturers must conform
   to U.S. export controls.

*  Key recovery won't protect privacy internationally and institutionalizes
   a global government surveillance mechanism without privacy safeguards.

*  U.S. exports are still controlled and uncompetitive making it harder for
   the market to develop a secure global encryption standard.

The Administration policy, initially announced on October 1st and dubbed
"Clipper 3.1.1," leaves Internet users without the technical means to secure
their communications or the international legal standards needed to protect
their privacy.

In other developments this week, Hewlett-Packard and other companies announced
preliminary approval to export new "dormant encryption" products, which
contain strong encryption that can only be activated with a special license.
While this new architecture is expected to make it easier for industry to
market encryption products, this technology does not change the underlying
privacy problems created by the Administration's export control policy.
Granting of licenses to use strong encryption will still be subject to the
current export controls limiting key length and requiring key recovery for
strong encryption.

CONTINUING A DANGEROUS KEY RECOVERY POLICY

The Administration's announcements mark the first real steps towards
implementing an approach to encryption policy based on the dangerous and
untested idea of global key recovery.  This approach would institutionalize
worldwide governmental access to encrypted communications without providing
any privacy standards for electronic communications or stored data.

The Administration's approach leaves computer users at risk operating on a
global network without the technical security provided by strong encryption
or the legal privacy rights afforded here in the United States by the Fourth
Amendment and federal law.  For example, the Administration policy would not
solve the following privacy problems:

*  International communications are still vulnerable.  For example, an
   American individual doing business with someone in France would still
   be forced to use weaker forms of encryption, or use key recovery systems
   that make their communications accessible to law enforcement officials of
   both countries.

*  Key recovery won't protect privacy internationally.  A Chinese dissident
   communicating with supporters in the U.S. and fearful of weaker encryption
   would be to forced to use key recovery. The Administration indicates that
   such key recovery mechanisms would be based on bilateral key-access
   arrangements between governments. Even if the dissident's keys were
   recoverable only in the U.S., such a global key access policy would
   almost certainly make those keys accessible to the Chinese government. If
   the United States expects China to assist U.S. law enforcement with key
   recovery for issues of national interest, such as anti-piracy efforts in
   China, we can also expect China to require U.S. disclosure of keys to its
   law enforcement community.

*  Exports are still controlled and uncompetitive.  A Japanese company using
   exportable U.S. encryption products would be forced to use lower strength
   encryption -- or use an key recovery agent approved by the U.S. law
   enforcement community. This is unlikely to help the global market develop
   a worldwide standard for secure communications.

As a result of this policy, computer users all over the world will be left
with a lowest common denominator infrastructure that does not provide for
either technical security or legal privacy for sensitive communications and
data. CDT believes that any workable U.S. encryption policy must be designed
to protect the privacy and security of Internet users.

 ----------------------------------------------------------------

(2) DETAILS OF THE EXECUTIVE ORDER

The Executive Order signed by the President on Friday does not change the
type of encryption products that will be exportable. Rather, it lays the
groundwork for the eventual transfer of encryption export control
jurisdiction from the State Department to the Commerce Department pending
Final Regulations by both departments.

Encryption exports have traditionally been regulated as "munitions"
controlled by the State Department. While the Commerce Department is widely
viewed as more sensitive to the needs of business and individual encryption
users, Commerce is still constrained by Administration encryption policy.
Additional provisions of the Executive Order indicate that the Commerce
Department's encryption controls will continue to be dominated by law
enforcement and national security interests:

*  New Justice Department role in export review committee -- In an unusual
   step, the Order adds the Justice Department to the interagency group
   reviewing Commerce encryption export decisions.

*  Source code treated as a "product" -- The Order specifically singles out
   encryption source code to be given the stricter review scrutiny of a
   "product" rather than a "technology."

*  Broad definition of export -- The export of encryption source code or
   object code is extended to explicitly include posting to FTP sites or
   electronic bulletin boards unless "adequate" precautions are taken to
   prevent transfer abroad. As reflected by a recent Federal Court finding
   in the CDA indecency case that Internet users rarely have control over
   the parties accessing materials via FTP, Usenet, or the Web, this
   provision could have the chilling effect of preventing most
   dissemination or discussion of new cryptographic tools on the Internet.

The Administration's announcements will have little effect on the existing
encryption privacy problem unless the underlying policies governing the
export and use of encryption are changed. These announcements do little to
address the unanswered questions about how privacy will be protected in the
key recovery system envisioned by the Administration.

APPOINTMENT OF THE "SPECIAL ENVOY FOR CRYPTOGRAPHY"

On Friday the President also designated Ambassador David L. Aaron as the
new "Special Envoy for Cryptography."  According to the White House, this
Special Envoy will have "responsibility to promote the growth of electronic
commerce and robust, secure global communications in a manner that protects
the public safety and national security. . . . Ambassador Aaron will promote
international cooperation, coordinate U.S. contacts with foreign governments
on encryption matters and provide a focal point for identifying and resolving
bilateral and multilateral encryption issues."  Ambassador Aaron is currently
the U.S. Ambassador to the OECD.

CDT hopes that the new Special Envoy, as a representative of the United
States, will work to represent the needs of Americans to communicate
privately in the currently insecure global environment.  Until now, U.S.
encryption representation abroad has been dominated by law enforcement and
national security interests. CDT hopes that the new Special Envoy will also
consult with the computer user community, consumers, privacy advocates, and
industry to promote their need for secure networks worldwide.

NEXT STEPS

In the coming months, both the Department of Commerce and the State
Department must issue rules to implement the Administration's new encryption
policy.

*  The State Department will issue a rule transferring its jurisdiction of
   encryption licensing  to the Commerce Department.

*  The Commerce Department will issue rules spelling out exactly how it will
   approve products for export, and what the requirements for approved key
   recovery centers and key recovery plans will look like.

CDT hopes and expects that the Administration will provide an opportunity
for public comment in the rulemaking process to allow input from those
concerned about privacy and security in the formulation of U.S. encryption
policy.

1996 INFORMATION SYSTEMS SECURITY SURVEY
Findings Reveal Security Problems in Fortune 1,000 Corporations

Baltimore, Maryland (November 19, 1996) ---- A new information security
survey of Fortune 1,000 firms has produced striking evidence of serious pro=
blems in many commercial organizations.  Nearly half of the 205 firms that =
responded
admitted that their computer networks had been successfully attacked and pe=
netrated by "outsiders" in the past year -- with losses and associated cost=
s considerably higher than previously estimated.

The results of the =9196 Information Systems Security Survey, which was
sponsored by WarRoom Research, LLC, will be presented during a Morning News=
maker press conference at the National Press Club in Washington, DC, 9 am T=
hursday,  November 21, 1996.

The survey also had another intriguing credential.  The survey questionnair=
e
was accompanied by a letter from Senator Sam Nunn=92s Chief Counsel with th=
e U.S. Senate=92s Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, expressing thei=
r interest in the results and promising to respect the survey=92s guarantee=
 of anonymity to all
respondents.

Mr. Gembicki expressed his gratitude to the respondents and to the groups
that distributed the survey:  IBM, Interpact/Infowar.com, National Computer=
 Security Association, Security Dynamics, Symantec, and the WheelGroup.
