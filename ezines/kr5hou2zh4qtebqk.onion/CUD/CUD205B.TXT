***  CuD #2.05: File 2 of 7: From the Mailbag                    ***
********************************************************************

In CUD Volume 2, Issue #2.04, you talk about email being intercepted
intentionally.  In some Internet email systems, the postmaster may receive
email messages that were unable to be properly delivered by the email
system.  It is difficult for a person acting as the postmaster not to read
such email, since some portions of the email messages may contain delivery
error reports.  This differs from the usual case in the US Post Office,
where the address and actual message text are clearly separated by an
opaque envelope (except, for instance, on postcards).

Any laws passed regarding email interception must take this matter into
account, I believe.
