Many times, this is the result of sloppy system administration.
Recently, one site I FTP'd into had the contents of /etc/passwd
readable by any FTP user. Makes you wonder about the rest of their
system security...

Subject: Article on Kevin Poulsen arrest
Date: Wed, 5 Jun 91 20:18:29 PDT

(The following is a bit old, but some may have missed it first
time around):

	"Acting on a tip from an "associate" of the 25 year old computer
	hacker, Pacific Bell investigator Terry Atchley was staking out the
	market (grocery store). He'd warned employees on the night shift
	that Poulsen wanted by the FBI, might show up. When Poulsen, with
	bleached hair and dressed in black jeans, t-shirt and leather
	jacket walked in, packing clerk Dave Hernandez seized the slender
	5-foor-8 suspect and bear-hugged dim until Atchley handcuffed him."

	Now when the hell did Pac Bell get granted arrest powers, including
	Deputizing 'packing clerks'....???

	The rest of the article  (Knight Ridder News Service) goes on to
	sensationalize the case. Also arrested was Mark K Lottor who
	evidently was him roomate...
