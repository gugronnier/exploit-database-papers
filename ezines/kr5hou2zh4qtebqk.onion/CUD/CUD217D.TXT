***  CuD #2.17: File 4 of 7: Thoughts on the Atlanta Sentencing  ***
********************************************************************

I find the statement in the sentencing memo "these three had acquired
tremendous information, enough to become frighteningly powerful" to be the
key to the governments prosecution.

The governemnt has always feared those who have gained power outside of the
channels of normal authority, and sought to destroy all those who have
gained this power.

The FBI sought to destroy King and the SCLC, not because he was a bad man,
but because he threatened the status quo.  The Black Panthers threatened
the status quo and they were destroyed. Read the history of organized
labor.  Every initial unionization attempt was met with violence and legal
assault, until the unions became part of the establishment.  Jesus was
crucified because he threatened the order.

Now hackers have started to seize information and power.  That power is a
potential force for good or evil.  That power could shake the world as they
know it.  So now all forces of law enforcement have begun to turn on those
who may threaten the order.

I would recommend that all those who wish to hack, listen to "Ruby, an
intergalactic gumshoe".  It's a radio drama from the people who did the
"fourth tower of Inverness"(best guess).  There there is an organization
called the digital circus, who build wrestling robots.  THey wrestle
against the rulers machines.  They never win, but always come a little
closer before throwing the match.

I would suggest that the sentencing memo serve as a warning to all other
hackers.

   SQUEALERS NEVER PROSPER.........

   John Doe the indiana stool pigeon, got for his troubles,
   a search warrant and indictment.

   The atlanta three got for their guilty plea and cooperation
   about 8 years and $250,000 in punishment.

I have been around criminal lawyers and investigators, for the better part
of my life.  I cannot suggest any case where cooperation brings help.  Now
all of them are also vulnerable on civil charges.

Had they all sat odwn, said prove the case and fought it out, they would
have done no worse.  and probably could have demolished the case with Dr
Dennings testimony.  But no, they squealed.  Someone ought to slap around
their attorneys.

   Craig Neidorf had it right with sheldon zenner.  Fight all the way.
Don't fight the good fight.  Fight with every drop of blood you have.
Fight constitutionality.  fight civilly.  fight in the press.  fight in the
legislature.

   If you are indicted, use your rights.  Subpoena every document of the
firms opposing you.  They claim billions in damages,  subpoena all their
operating records.  get their expense records of top officials.  Use your
subpoena rights to find dirt on their witnesses.  It's there, you just
have to look for it.

   IF there is going to be a computer underground, then it's going to have to
learn how to fight and win in the courts and legislatures and public
opinion.  that means controlling our excesses.  learning how to measure
performance, and developing ethics.

   Ethics.  The Dark adept wrote about these.  Why break into yet another TSO
machine?  Don't damage data.  Learn to respect privacy rights.  IF you find
a security bug, publish it, but learn how to offer your services to fix
these.  Learn to realize that trespassing via computer is no different then
trespass by foot.  Create playlands.  The LOTS machine at stanford provided
many a safe outlet.  Get these machines going at the larger colleges.  Why
can't their still be LOTS?

   Learn to realize limits, as well.  well best of luck for those of you out
there.

 I remain, The Advocate.
