********************************************************************

Here's a recently published book that will be of interest to CuD readers.
This summary has been taken, verbatim, from the flaps of the dust jacket.

_Computer Ethics: Cautionary Tales and Ethical Dilemmas in Computing_
Forester, Tom and Perry Morrison
1990.   The MIT Press. Cambridge, Massachusetts.
ISBN 0-262-06131-7   (hardcover)
Price paid: $19.95  193 pages, with index

_Computer Ethics_ exposes the dangers of letting society rely too heavily
on computers..  Written by two insiders, it provides balanced and
authoritative coverage of such topics as software unreliability, computer
crime, software theft, hacking, viruses, unmanageable complexity, invasions
of privacy, "artificial intelligence," and degraded work.

The authors describe these problem areas with fascinating, often dramatic
examples of computer abuse and misuse, augmented by extensive notes and
references, role-playing exercises, and hypothetical situations.  There
are suggestions for further discussion at the end of each chapter.

Forester and Morrison argue that it is the nature of computer systems to
be unreliable, insecure, and unpredictable, and that society must face
the consequences.  _Computer Ethics_ is an outgrowth of the authors' work
with computer science student, focusing on the ethical dilemmas these
students will confront as professionals.

About the authors:

Tom Forester teaches in the School of Computing and Information Technology
at Griffith University in Queensland, Australia, and is author or editor
of six books on technology and society.  Perry Morrison is Lecturer in
Computing at the University of New England, New South Wales, Australia.
