***  CuD #3.14: File 5 of 6: Fox and the Hollywood Hacker        ***
********************************************************************

Fox's assault on the Hollywood Hacker gets even more bizarre.  First
one of their camera people is busted with a weapon by the Secret
Service when they found him near President Bush, and now Murray Povich
has come out with his book that makes us wonder what goes on inside
the corporate board rooms, bedrooms, and computer rooms.

If what Povich says is true, it seems that some of these tabloid tv
types routinely bustle around spying and snooping, but when somebody
turns the tables the scream and yell.

Consider this from
"Current Affairs: A Life on the Edge" by Maury Povich with Ken Gross.
Published 1991 by GP Putnam's Sons.

Chapter 14, pgss 207-208.

      "The launch date for 'Inside Edition' was January of 1989 and we
      went shopping around the satellites, trying to find out what
      stories they were going to do. That's how shows worked--they
      fiddled around with frequencies and latched onto the
      communications channels and listened in on the shop talk. It was
      spying. We all did it, switching around the dials, trying to
      pick up their satellite, pointing the transponders to find their
      bird so we could listen to their teleconferences and their
      stations, trying to winkle out what stories they were after.

      They were also doing the same thing to us, because they knew how
      we worked and it was part of the game. Young and Tomlin were not
      there for nothing. I knew 'Inside Edition' was into our computer
      because that's the way it is. Maybe it's illegal, but that's the
      'Front Page' mentality."

Throughout the entire book, Povich brags about the many and sundry
ploys, devious tactics, and outright lies used by Current Affair
staffers to get material (tapes and/or interviews) for their show. He
constantly puts down the stuffed-shirt/establishment news types and
makes he and his minions out to be heroic characters-- pioneers of a
newer, braver school of journalism. "Killer journalists of the
nineties," he calls them. Their battle cry: "Maybe it's not ethical,
mate, but it's legal." (pg 254).

I thought that maybe inquiring minds would want to know.
