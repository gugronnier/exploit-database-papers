 NEWS RELEASE 7/12/94

Computer Professionals for Social Responsibility (CPSR)

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

CPSR ANNOUNCES WEB SERVER WITH 60 NEW PAGES OF INFORMATION

Palo Alto, July 12, 1994. Computer Professionals for Social
Responsibility (CPSR) is pleased to announce the availability of
its redesigned World-Wide Web (WWW) server, now with 60 new
hypertext pages of timely and important information for Internet
users and the general public. The CPSR Home Page can be found at
URL: http://www.cpsr.org/home with hypertext browsers like
Mosaic and Lynx.

WWW grew from the need of physicists at the European Particle
Physics Laboratory (CERN) to communicate with pictures and text to
colleagues around the world in hypertext, non-linear format. Since
its beginning in 1989, WWW has allowed people to link their
electronic documents and images to other documents on computers
around the world. Estimates say there were, as of May 1994, over
4,500 hypertext Web server computers capable of linking documents
on the 10,000 computer networks comprising the world-wide Internet.

CPSR's Web Pages cover issues related to the organization's mission
to provide the public and policymakers with realistic assessments of
the power, promise, and problems of information technology. These
issues include the National Information Infrastructure, Civil
Liberties and Privacy, Computers in the Workplace, Technology
Policy and Human Needs, Gender and Minority Issues, Reliability and
Risks of Computer-Based Systems and Community Networking. There are
also links to many reports and other sources of information. All
links are provided with descriptive narratives, and are not just
lists of files. CPSR will continually update their pages to insure
the accuracy and usefulness of this resource.

CPSR was founded in 1981 by a group of computer scientists
concerned about the use of computers in nuclear weapons systems.
CPSR has since grown into a national public-interest alliance of
information technology professionals and other people. Currently,
CPSR has 22 chapters in the U.S. and affiliations with similar
groups worldwide. The National Office is in Palo Alto, California.

Subject: File 3--Re: Sysop Liability for Copyright

I found David Batterson's article concerning sysop liability (CuD
6.64) interesting, bringing out some points that help to balance
others made in a previous article (CuD 6.62).  However, I'd like to
briefly address a theme, exemplified in the following quotes, that
permeate his article:

   "All responsible sysops do NOT allow immediate downloading..."

   "If you allow immediately downloads, you are providing tacit
approval for users to upload commercial software programs, which could
then be available for immediate download.  Such a policy by
unscrupulous sysops does show they know what is going on; it is a
bogus 'wink-wink' attitude...  Most sysops simply do NOT stoop to this
unethical level, as Frena did.  He is guilty, and deserves his
punishment."

   "Frena knew EXACTLY what he was doing, and that was a bogus means
to avoid obeying U.S. copyright laws in this country.  His intent to
infringe is obvious to anyone who understands the BBS community."

Although it is true that many sysops review material before it is
provided for download, and although some sysops may indeed use
immediate download as an attempt to get around the law, and although
Frena may indeed be one of the latter case, I think it is dangerous to
do what David Batterson has done, namely, to over-generalize these
possibilities and then deductively draw a specific conclusion from the
unjustified premise.

For example, a sysop may indeed simply not have the time to check all
downloads on a regular basis.  This, I know, has been true of some
BBS's and is true of at least one FTP site, the CICA site.  This
leaves the administrator with an interesting dilemma.  Does she allow
immediate downloading and risk breaking the law?  Or does she
alternatively allow downloading of a file only after it has been
checked, which, with her schedule, would render many files obsolete
before they could be made available for download?

Also, it does not follow that "such a policy... show[s] they [the
sysops] know what is going on."  This statement assumes guilt and then
sets about proving it by circumstancial evidence.  As I pointed out
above, such a policy in practice does not always imply intention.  In
fact, one could make a case that, if a sysop did in fact know that
copyrighted material was being distributed on his BBS, he would begin
requiring approval for uploaded material or take some other action.
Thus, one might assert, it follows that such a policy shows that he
does _not_ know what is going on.

Furthermore, the above quotes, which are typical of the statements Mr.
Batterson makes on this question, contain several purely emotive
elements that have no perceivable rational basis.  They are
unobjectively filled with a lack of concern for the very real
diversity of intentions in cyberspace and throughout humankind in
general.  Loaded words such as "unscrupulous," "unethical,"
"wink-wink," and "bogus," unjustly applied, only exemplify the
author's insensitivity.  And the statement that Frena's intent "is
obvious to anyone who understands the BBS community" is, again, an
unsupported claim that bears examination.  It is not at all
crystal-clear to me, given the available information, and I consider
myself to be one who understands, at least somewhat, the cyberspace
community.

Subject: File 4--Submission - Death of Gary Kildall - CP-M author dead at 52

Derived from a Associated Press article

Gary Kildall, author of the first popular operating system for personal
computers (Control Program-Monitor or CP-M) is dead at age 52.  Kildall
received a Ph.D. in computer science from University of Washington.  An
autopsy failed to determine the cause of death.  A brief history:

1973 - CP-M (Control Program-Monitor) written
1974 - Formed Digital Research with his then-wife Dorothy McEwen
1980 - Approached by IBM to develop DOS for its personal computers*
1985 - Founded Knowledge-Set to develop consumer CD-ROM applications
1991 - Digital Research sold to Novell in $80M stock-swap deal

* IBM also meets with Bill Gates; IBM markets both MS-DOS and CP-M,
  pricing MS-DOS at $40 and CP-M at $240

In a 1981 interview, Kildall said, "Basically, I am a gadget-oriented
person.  I like to work with gadgets, dials, and knobs."
