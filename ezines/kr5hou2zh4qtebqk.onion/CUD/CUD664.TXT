Subject: File 1--Summary of Issues in CPSR/FOIA - 2600 Case

((MODERATORS' NOTE: We reprint the following post from Dave Banisar in
1993, which summarized the issues in the alleged Secret Service spying
on a lawful and peaceful gathering of 2600 "club" computer enthusiasts
in a public setting. Brock Meeks, author of the second post, broke the
story that what seemed to be the result of mall security was in fact
an incident precipitated by, and "ram-rodded" by the Secret Service.
If reports are correct, it would seem that the Secret Service exceeded
its mandated authority.  As in the case of the Steve Jackson Games
incident, in which the USSS lost a civil suit for its over-zealous
methods of search-and-seizure, it seems that the USSS is again about
to be embarrassed for violating the very rights it is sworn to
protect.  The USSS denied involvement, But, As Brock Meeks
colorfully says:

     Those pale faces you see are from the Secret Service as
     they watch their denial being chewed away in great hunks
     like so many wounded tuna in the middle of shark feeding
     frenzy.

CPSR filed a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request to obtain
USSS documents related to the case. But, the USSS stalled until
CPSR filed suit to obtain the documents'release. In the last issue
of CuD (6.63), we reprinted the judge's decision in favor of the
CPSR suit. Here, we refresh readers memories with the issues in the
case in this file and Brock Meek's update in the next)).

==============================================================

        As you may recall, last November (1992) at a shopping mall
outside of Washington, DC, a group of people affiliated with the
computer magazine "2600" was confronted by mall security personnel,
local police officers and several unidentified individuals.  The
group members were ordered to identify themselves and to submit to
searches of their personal property.  Their names were recorded by
mall security personnel and some of their property was confiscated.
However, no charges were ever brought against any of the individuals
at the meeting.

        Computer Professionals for Social Responsibility ("CPSR")
filed suit under the Freedom of Information Act and today received
the Secret Service's response to the FOIA lawsuit, in which we are
seeking agency records concerning the break-up of the meeting.  I
think it's safe to say that our suspicions have now been confirmed --
the Secret Service *did* obtain a list of names from mall security
identifying the people in attendance at the meeting.

        There are three main points contained in the Secret Service's
court papers that are significant:


        1) The agency states that the information it possesses
concerning the incident was obtained "in the course of a criminal
investigation that is being conducted pursuant to the Secret
Service's authority to investigate access device and computer fraud."


        2) The agency possesses two relevant documents and the
information in those documents "consists solely of information
identifying individuals."

        3) The information was obtained from a "confidential source,"
and the agency emphasizes that the FOIA's definition of such a source
includes "any private institution which provided information on a
confidential basis."

        Taken together, these facts seem to prove that the Secret
Service wanted names, they had the mall security people collect them,
and they came away from the incident with the list they wanted.

        The agency asserts that "[t]he premature release of the
identities of the individual(s) at issue could easily result in
interference to the Secret Service's investigation by alerting these
individual(s) that they are under investigation and thus allowing the
individual(s) to alter their behavior and/or evidence."

        CPSR, in conjunction with EFF and the ACLU, is planning to
challenge the actions of the mall security personnel, the local police
and the Secret
Service on the ground that the incident amounted to a warrantless
search and seizure conducted at the behest of the Secret Service.

Subject: File 2--Update on the CPSR/2600 FOIA Suit

Jacking in from the "Cough It Up" Port:

Washington, DC -- A recent ruling in federal district court here
could hold the key that finally unlocks a bizarre, two-year-old
mystery that blends a questionable search and seizure  incident, a
group of young hackers, the Secret Service, a public mall, Santa
Claus and cheese fries with all the subtlety of an industrial grade
blender.

On July 1, U.S. District Judge Louis Oberdorfer kicked the slats
out of a year old attempt by the Secret Service to keep secret
documents that detail its involvement in the November 1992
"Pentagon City Mall Raid," an incident in which about 30 young
hackers were rounded up, detained and their person's searched with
no explanation or purpose.

The judge ordered the documents turned over to the Electronic
Privacy Information Center (EPIC), which brought suit under the
Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) under its former affiliation,
Computer Professionals for Social Responsibility.

This quiet court drama hinges on something called the "Johnson
Factor," which has all the elements of a spy novel:  Cunning,
intrigue, and the fate of a community hanging in the balance.

The "Johnson Factor" is so-named for then mall security director,
Al Johnson.   The day after the incident took place, Communications
Daily, an industry trade publication, broke the story of the Secret
Service involvement after interviewing Johnson -- on tape -- in
which he admitted that the Secret Service "ramrodded this whole
thing."

The Secret Service, then and now, continues to deny any involvement
in the incident.  The EPIC suit and Judge Oberdorfer's ruling
combine to turn over the rock under which the agency has been
stashing its thinly veiled deception.

The Judge writes in his memorandum ordering the Secret Service to
cough up the documents that the agency "has failed to demonstrate
that the release of each of the documents it has withheld would
interfere with the ongoing investigation" in any way.

The Secret Service has steadfastly refused to discuss the issue of
whether or not an investigation of any kind involving one of the
2600 members was underway at the time the incident occurred.

The judge's memo continues:  The Secret Service's "public filings
state that the investigation involves allegations made by a private
corporation of telephone fraud... Thus, [the agency] cannot fear
the possibility that release of the withheld documents might reveal
[its] involvement in this type of investigation."

The judge made these decisions after reviewing some 50-plus pages
of "in camera" documents submitted by the Secret Service.  These
are documents that can only be viewed by the judge because they
reportedly hold damaging information.

"Usually these in camera documents are filled with horror stories
about the damage that could be done if the documents they protect
are released," said David Sobel, EPIC's legal bulldog.  Sobel filed
papers asking the judge to let him see the in camera documents.
"No chance," was essentially the judge's decision on that request.
Still, Sobel says the overall order is a very good sign.

"I think it's significant that the judge didn't buy it... the
argument that no documents could be released," Sobel said.
Usually, such secret background papers equal a cakewalk for the
government bluebloods, with judges ruling overwhelmingly in their
favor, Sobel said.

Another section of the judge's memo on his ruling opens up yet
another gaping wound in the Secret Service claim that they weren't
involved: "[T]he fact that the documents at issue are responsive to
[EPIC's] FOIA request indicates that those documents concern the
breakup of the November 6, 1992 meeting at Pentagon City.  Thus,
[the agency] cannot claim...  to withhold documents based on the
possibility that the documents would reveal that investigators were
interested in that meeting."

Those pale faces you see are from the Secret Service as they watch
their denial being chewed away in great hunks like so many wounded
tuna in the middle of shark feeding frenzy.

Although the Secret Service claims to be withholding some eight
documents because their release could compromise "confidential
sources," in reality, they may be jealously trying to guard
themselves from a civil lawsuit.

This two-year old incident turns on the events surrounding an
evening "raid" on a monthly "2600 Meeting."  Such meetings -- held
every month throughout the U.S. ---bring together young hackers,
which are loosely identified under the banner of the "2600"
moniker, the name of a hacker's magazine.  Activities at these
meetings include such hijinks as swapping hacking stories, insults
and swiping each other's cheese fries.  You see, the Pentagon City
"2600" meeting isn't held in the bleak bowels of the mall's
concrete infrastructure.  Rather,  it's held in the most open,
public space available: The food court.

Shortly after 6 p.m. when the meeting started that November, the
mall security guards closed in on the group from all sides,
segregating them from other mall patrons with all the deftness of
novice cowpokes cutting "little dawgies" from a herd.  The kids
were told "don't move" as their names were taken, packages,
backpacks and other personal belongings were searched.  No
authorization nor explanation for the detention and search was
given by the security guards.   They refused to answer any of the
kid's questions.

According the "Johnson Factor," the Secret Service pressed the mall
security guards into action to do their bidding, a move that
contains its own legal tumbleweed.  The unwarranted search and
seizure of property raises the specter of civil rights violations
under the 4th amendment.

A month after the original incident, a reporter  attended the
December 2600 meeting at Pentagon City.   The reporter repeatedly
questioned a man associated with the mall about the incident.  The
man, who at several different intervals identified himself as "a
store employee";  "the person responsible for the food court";  a
person "who just wants to make sure the shoppers have a good time";
and finally "Santa Claus" eventually had the reporter physically
removed from the mall under threat of arrest.  The man was later
identified as the mall's operation's manager.

The mall management to this day refuses to discuss the raid.

EPIC's Sobel declined to speculate what the Secret Service's next
move would be.   However, by law  they have 60 days to file an
appeal.    The clock's ticking.

Meeks out...

Subject: File 3--Response to - Sysop Liability for Copyright (CuD 6.62)

RE:  Sysop Liability for Copyright (CuD 6.62)

     "George Frena is the sysop of a BBS in Florida called 'Techs
Warehouse.'   His BBS carries, among other things, adult material.
At the time of the court decision, Frena provided free access to
users who purchased products from him, and charged $25 a month to
those who did not.  Frena allowed subscribers to upload whatever
they wanted onto his BBS, and uploads were apparently immediately
available for downloading."

I'm a computer journalist, specializing in online services, BBSs,
e-mail, modems, etc.  I found this case of particular interest, since
I am also an ex-sysop myself, and personally know many sysops.

The third sentence in the paragraph is very significant, and probably
the reason why the courts ruled against Frena--and rightfully so.
All responsible sysops do NOT allow immediate downloading, for two
obvious reasons: files must be screened for viruses, and also checked
to see if they would infringe copyright laws.

If you allow immediately downloads, you are providing tacit approval
for users to upload commercial software programs, which could then be
available for immediate download.  Such a policy by unscrupulous
sysops does show they know what is going on; it is a bogus
"wink-wink" attitude, i.e., "I'll pretend like I don't know what they
are doing, thus I'm not responsible."  Most sysops simply do NOT
stoop to this unethical level, as Frena did.  He is guilty, and
deserves his punishment.


     "First, even if Frena himself did not copy the pictures, the
Court said that was irrelevant.  The mere presence of the images on
his BBS was enough:

     There is no dispute that Defendant Frena supplied a product
     containing unauthorized copies of a copyrighted work.  It does
     not matter that Defendant Frena claims he did not make the
     copies himself.

     Second, even if Frena did not *intend* to violate PEI's
copyrights, the Court held this too was irrelevant:

     It does not matter that Defendant Frena may have been unaware
     of the copyright infringement.  Intent to infringe is not
     needed to find copyright infringement. ... [E]ven an innocent
     infringer is liable for infringement ... ."


I think the Court is more perceptive than you give them credit for
being.  That sysop--Frena-- knew EXACTLY what he was doing, and that
was a bogus means to avoid obeying U.S. copyright laws in this
country.  His intent to infringe is obvious to anyone who understands
the BBS community.



     "The Court in FRENA has essentially put the burden on BBS
sysops (at least those that charge money for access) of reviewing
all files on their boards for possible copyright and trademark
infringements.  Regardless of the sysops' good faith or efforts to
remove infringing files, the sysop will be liable for copyright
trademark infringement for those files that escape detection."


And rightfully so.  It's not that difficult to tell if a file is
freeware, shareware or otherwise in the public domain.  It's also
a store's burden to make sure it is not selling counterfeit copies of
videos, CDs, T-shirts or Dali prints.

     "Several aspects of the FRENA decision are open to question and
the opinion certainly will not be the last word, especially when a
case is decided by a court more attuned to the technology involved."

I think the decision will be upheld by higher courts.

     "However, one can wonder about the Court's unquestioning
application of this principle to files uploaded by users.  Are a
BBS's file directories similar to paper publications, as the Court
assumed without discussing the question, or are they more like a
swap meet or shopping mall where the sysop provides the space, and
the users provide the goods?  Holding a sysop strictly liable for
the legal pedigree of every file on the BBS significantly limits
the core innovation of BBSs -- free two-directional file transfer."


On the BBS I ran with a friend, we NEVER allowed commercial software
files in the download section.  If someone uploaded such a program--
which occasional happened--it was deleted.  Never did we assume
that it was OK to allow commercial programs online since the BBS was
merely an electronic conduit for distributing files.


     "A newspaper publisher cannot claim not to know what is in the
newspaper; the publisher makes the decision what to include and
what to leave out.  The sysop does not necessarily do this, or know
what is on the BBS at any given time."


Responsible sysops check file uploads on a regular basis, and
ascertain which ones are permissible to add to the download section.
It's not that big a deal.

     "Given the ability to upload and download files without the
sysop's knowledge, is it proper to hold the sysop strictly liable for
the presence of infringing files?"

Of course it is!


     "The Court in FRENA imposed liability regardless of the sysop's
knowledge of what users were doing on his board."

Nonsense.  Frena knew exactly what his users were doing, and so did
The Court.


     "Would the Court have reached the same conclusion so easily if
Frena had been the owner of a shopping mall leasing space to a tenant
who was (without his knowledge) selling Metallica T-shirt rip-offs?"

This is NOT a valid comparison.  Frena wasn't providing space for
others to make money; HE was the one making money (charging $25/mo.)
by allowing users to illegally obtain copyrighted materials.


     "The Court also appeared to misunderstand the nature of a BBS
when it held that the availability of the image files violated the
"display" right aspect of a copyright.  The Court apparently
believed the images were actually *displayed* to the user, a
capability that is only offered by some large commercial BBSs, and
is limited by the user's communication software."

The images can be displayed as soon as they are downloaded, by using
widely available image-viewing software.  So the fact that they
were not viewable while on the BBS is irrelevant in my opinion.  You
can read a description of files on any BBS, so you know basically
what you will SOON be viewing offline.

     "These problems with the FRENA opinion demonstrate that the
courts continue to struggle to understand computer communication
technology."

That may be true, but the courts CAN recognize copyright infringement
when they see it.  And so can I, without being a lawyer.

  WHY THE GUIDE?: My favorite things on the Internet are informative,
high-quality newsletters. The quality of info contributed to what Mitch
Kapor describes as the Net's "gift economy" is amazing. However, despite
some excellent e-pub guides, tracking down good NEWSY letters can be
frustrating because they get lost in the flood of zines and very
technical pubs.

  So this list aims to point people to the news-oriented net-letters with
somewhat broader appeal. It's not intended to be as comprehensive as
other guides, but helpful nevertheless. The list is tremendously biased
toward e-mail delivery. Very technical and fanzine newsletters are not
included because they are well covered by other guides.

  Don't necessarily expect to find the latest, startup letters on this
list. I'm starting to hold back on listing new publications until they
demonstrate a consistent publishing schedule. Subscribing to a letter
that fails to keep its promises is annoying; even it's free. If the net
is indeed a community, even volunteers follow through on commitments.

  +BONG -- The official newsletter of the Burned-Out Newspapercreatures
Guild which appears to consist of a single witty and bitterly cynical
Dayton Daily News reporter. Sample commentary on today's headlines: "So
how come Nicole Simpson's dog, and the renter of her ex-husband O.J.
Simpson's guest house, were both named Cato?" Short.
  How to get it: E-mail: (bong-l@netcom.com; SUBSCRIBE BONG-L YOUR NAME)

collectors, museums, artists, art and government. Very promising, but

/pub/satellite/sj); WWW (http://itre.uncecs.edu/misc/sj/sj.html)

thing is that they're all pretty high quality. Headline news from British
satellite newsletter Transponder. Moderate length.
  How to get it: E-mail (editor@trponder.win-uk.net)

  CYBER-SLEAZE: Overhyped and a bit tedious, Cyber-Sleaze is composed of
low-grade gossip and put out by former MTV VJ Adam Curry. This address
may not be good for long (since Curry's being sued by MTV for trademark
infringement). Short, thankfully.
  How to get it: E-mail (csleaze@mtv.com)

primarily from the majors. Moderate length.
  How to get it: E-Mail (listproc@educom.edu; SUB EDUPAGE YOUR NAME).

  CYBERWIRE DISPATCH: Very high quality coverage of the Internet and
cyberspace, particularly looking at the various miscreants tromping
around the net. Editor Brock Meeks (a real reporter for Communications
Daily in civilian life) became famous by getting sued for libel by a
"make.money.fast"-type. But will SOMEONE get this man a listerver? At the
very least post it to Usenet. Short.
  How to get it: E-mail on the Com-Priv mailing list
(comp-privacy-request@pica.army.mil; SUBSCRIBE COM-PRIV); Gopher
(gopher.well.sf.ca.us)

  HOTT: Hot Off The Tree re-emerged with a lot of self-hype promising
articles on latest advances in computer, communications, and electronics
technologies. Great stuff, but only part one of the first gigantic issue
arrived here and and one of the principals hasn't responded to several
e-mail messages. Oh well...
  How to get it: E-mail (listserv@ucsd.edu; SUBSCRIBE YOUR@ADDRESS
HOTT-LIST).

  +BITS AND BYTES -- Good computer miscellanea. But why do so many
publications grab stuff from Edupage? On the long side.

BITS-N-BYTES); FTP (ftp.dana.edu: /periodic; Gopher (gopher.dana.edu:
Electronic Journals).

  NETWORKS & COMMUNITY: The emphasis here is on "community" in
Internet-land. Short and less techie than you might expect. Too much
excerpting from other net sources, particularly Edupage. How To Get It:
E-Mail (rre-request@weber.ucsd.edu; SUBSCRIBE YOUR NAME)
Gopher: (gopher.well.sf.ca.us or gopher.nlc-bnc.ca).

very newsy, but thoughtful. Fairly short.

  How to get it: E-Mail(privacy-request@vortex.com); FTP
{ftp.vortex.com}; Gopher {gopher.vortex.com}.

  COMPUTER UNDERGROUND DIGEST: The latest news on cyberspace issues.
CUD's best when screaming about the latest hacker or BBS raid, good when
picking apart government policy issues. And give 'em credit, they haven't
reprinted the entire agenda for some upcoming computer conference
(YAWN!!!) in a few months. Moderate length.
  How to get it: E-Mail (listserv@vmd.cso.uiuc.edu, SUB CUDIGEST YOUR

(comp.risks); FTP (crvax.sri.com).

  CURRENT CITES: A monthly letter for library technology, composed of
pointers to magazine articles. On the dry side, partly because
of its format.
  How to get it: E-mail (listserv@library.berkeley.edu; SUB CITES YOUR
NAME); FTP: (ftp.lib.berkeley.edu:/pub/Current.Cites).

 +----------------------------Policy--------------------------------

Environmental Research Foundation. (Who's Rachel?)

(gopher.well.sf.ca.us); Usenet (alt.activism, talk.abortion, soc.women).

  INFORMATION POLICY ONLINE: Counterprogramming the privacy advocates,
IPO come from the Information Industry Association and covers legislation
regarding government restriction on information. Too little real news,
too many items about the direct mail industry's lobbying. But a welcome
counterpoint to the net's generally one-sided privacy debates. (I'm a
reporter; I WANT your driving records!) Moderate length.
  How to get it: E-Mail (iiaipo-request@his.com; SUBSCRIBE YOUR NAME)

bi-weekly newsletter on medicine by Health Info-Com Network, put together

  +ASIAINFO HEADLINE DAILY NEWS -- Daily offering 30-40 headlines from
Asian markets plus 3-5 brief articles. The business-oriented headline
service is bait to lure $$$ subscriptions for a full news report. (A

stand-alone pub.
