Subject: File 1--ERRATA in CuD #5.60

Ooops---In thanking our NIU folk in CuD 5.60, we misspelled the
name of the Director of our Academic Computing Service. Michael
Prais, not "Preis." Sorry 'bout that, Michael.

We also indicated that WYLBUR was our operating system. Neil Rickert
gently corrected us:

     Actually WYLBUR is not an operating system at all.  It is
     just a multi-user interactive text editor which runs under
     the operating system MVS-XA.

     The computer center is finally taking the plunge and getting
     a Unix system for those university users who need Unix.
     We've been pushing them in this direction.  I don't yet know
     what the arrangements and policies will be for this system.

                   NSA Seeks Delay in Clipper Case


     The National Security Agency (NSA) has asked a federal court for
a one-year delay in a lawsuit challenging the secrecy of the
government's "Clipper Chip" encryption proposal.  The suit was filed
by Computer Professionals for Social Responsibility (CPSR) on May 28
and seeks the disclosure of all information concerning the
controversial plan.

     In an affidavit submitted to the United States District Court for
the District of Columbia on August 9, NSA Director of Policy Michael
A. Smith states that

     NSA's search for records responsive to [CPSR's] request is under
     way, but is not yet complete.  Because the Clipper Chip program
     is a significant one involving the participation of organizations
     in four of NSA's five Directorates and the Director's staff, the
     volume of responsive documents is likely to be quite large.
     Moreover, because the Clipper Chip program is highly complex and
     technical and is, in substantial part, classified for national
     security purposes, the review process cannot be accomplished
     quickly.

     CPSR called for the disclosure of all relevant information and
full public debate on the proposal on April 16, the day it was
announced.  While NSA has insisted from the outset that the "Skipjack"
encryption algorithm, which underlies the Clipper proposal, must
remain secret, the Smith affidavit contains the first suggestion that
the entire federal program is classified "in substantial part."  In
the interest of obtaining timely judicial review of the agency's broad
classification claim, CPSR intends to oppose NSA's request for delay
in the court proceedings.

     In another case involving government cryptography policy, CPSR
has challenged NSA's classification of information concerning the
development of the Digital Signature Standard (DSS).  The court is
currently considering the issue and a decision is expected soon.

     CPSR is a national public-interest alliance of computer industry
professionals dedicated to examining the impact of technology on
society.  CPSR has 21 chapters in the U.S. and maintains offices in
Palo Alto, California, and Washington, DC.  For additional information

             COMPUTER PROFESSIONALS ADD SOCIAL CONSCIENCE
                      TO NATIONAL NETWORK DEBATE

Palo Alto, Calif., August 6, 1993  --  At a recent meeting in
Washington  D.C., board members from Computer Professionals for Social
Responsibility (CPSR) were challenged by top level telecommunications
policy experts to craft a public interest vision of the National
Information Infrastructure (NII).  The experts at the roundtable
discussion included Mike Nelson from the President's Office of Science
and Technology, Vint Cerf from the Internet Society, Jamie Love from
the Taxpayer's Assets Project, Ken Kay from Computer Systems Policy
Project, and Laura Breeden from FARnet.

"We were excited to discover that CPSR is in a position to play a key
role in shaping NII policy," said CPSR Board President, Eric Roberts.
"The commercial sector is already in the thick of the debate, but
there has been little coordinated response from the noncommercial
constituencies.  After talking about the issues and CPSR's role, the
Board committed to meeting this challenge."

So far, the debate about the NII has centered around fiber versus
ISDN, cable companies versus telephone companies, research versus
commercialization, and so on.  These are real questions with
important  implications.  However, CPSR believes that a better
starting point is a set of guiding principles as the context for all these
more detailed questions about "architecture," technical standards,
and prime contractor.  Before arguing over bits and bytes, it is crucial
to clarify the vision and values that underlie a major endeavor like
the NII.

As individuals in the computing profession, CPSR's membership
knows that new technologies bring enormous social change.
CPSR's goal is to help shape this change in an informed manner.
Key issues discussed in the paper will include:

o     ensuring that the design remains both open and flexible so
       that it can evolve with changing technology.

o     ensuring that all citizens have affordable network access and
       the training necessary to use these resources.

o      ensuring that risks of network failure and the concomitant
        social costs are carefully considered in the NII design.

o      protecting privacy and First Amendment principles in
        electronic communication.

o     guaranteeing that the public sector, and particularly schools
       and libraries, have access to public data at a reasonable cost.

o     seeking ways in which the network can strengthen democratic
       participation and community development at all levels.

o     ensuring that the network continues to be a medium for
       experimentation and non commercial sharing of resources,
       where individual citizens are producers as well as consumers.

o     extending the vision of an information infrastructure beyond
      its current focus of a national network, to include a global
      perspective.

The national membership of CPSR brings a unique perspective to the
overall conception of the NII.  Throughout CPSR's history, the
organization has worked to encourage public discussion of decisions
involving the use of computers in systems critical to society and to
challenge the assumption that technology alone can solve political and
social problems.  This past year, CPSR's staff, national and chapter
leadership have worked on privacy guidelines for the National Research
and Education Network (NREN), conducted a successful conference on
participatory design, created local community networks, organized
on-line discussion groups on intellectual property, and much more.

To ensure that its position paper is broadly representative, CPSR will
work in concert with other public interest groups concerned about the
NII, such as the newly established coalition in Washington D.C., the
Telecommunications Policy Roundtable.  CPSR chapters are will be
conducting a broad based public campaign to reach out beyond the
technical experts and producers -- to people who will be affected by
the NII even if they never directly log on.

CPSR will begin distributing its completed paper to policy makers on
October 16th at its annual meeting in Seattle, Washington.  The
meeting will bring together local, regional and national decision
 makers to take a critical look at the NII.

Founded in 1981, CPSR is a national, non-profit, public interest
organization of computer scientists and other professionals concerned
with the impact of computer technology on society.  With offices in
Palo Alto, California, and Washington D.C., CPSR works to dispel
popular myths about technological systems and to encourage the use of
computer technology to improve the quality of life.

Subject: File 6--UPDATE #21-AB1624: *ACTION ALERT*: END-GAME APPROACHING

        *** PLEASE WRITE, NOW!***      PLEASE, DON'T STOP NOW!

  Assembly Bill 1624, mandating online public access to public
legislative information via the public networks (i.e., the Internet
and all the nets connected to it - including wherever you are
receiving this msg), will either pass the Legislature by Sept. 10th,
or will die - and we have to re-fight the whole battle, year after
year.

  LETTERS & FAXES ARE *NEEDED*!.  THEY *WILL* DETERMINE THE OUTCOME.

REMAINING 1993 LEGISLATION SCHEDULE
  Jul 16th, the Legislature went into remission - uh, recess.
  Aug 16th, the Legislature reconvenes to diddle remaining 1993 business.
  Sep 10th, the Legislature quits working in Sacramento for the year.
  Oct 10th, the Governor must veto legislatively-approved bills he opposes.
On AUGUST 18TH, the Senate Rules Committee run by Sen. Dave Roberti
(D-Van Nuys area) will hear AB1624.  If Roberti doesn't like it, he can and
will kill it.   If Roberti passes it, it will almost-certainly pass the
Senate. Then we need for the Assembly to "concur in amendments" and the
Governor to not veto it.


  Address letters/faxes to "State Capitol, Sacremanto CA 95814."

AS SOON AS POSSIBLE, send a one-page letter supporting AB1624 to the
Senate Rules Committee - who have seen essentially *no* support for it:
Sen. David Roberti, Chair, Room 400; fax/916-323-7224; voice/916-445-8390.
 and to the other four members (tiny, *powerful* committee!):
Sen. Ruben Ayala (D-Chino area), Room 5108; f/916-445-0128; v/916-445-6868.
Sen. Robert Beverly (R-Long Bch), Room 5082; f/not avail.; v/916-445-6447.
Sen. William Craven (R-Oceanside), Room 3070; f/not avail.; v/916-445-3731.
Sen. Nick Petris (D-Alameda), Room 5080; fax/916-327-1997; v/916-445-6577.

Important:  Please send COPIES of ALL letters to the AB1624 author:
Hon. Debra Bowen, Room 3126; voice/916-445-8528; fax/916-327-2201.


CAN EMAIL VIA ME, IF YA CAN'T FIND TIME FOR SNAIL-MAIL
  If you don't have time to send snail-mail, you can email your message via
jwarren@well.sf.ca.us.
  Write it exactly as you would snail-mail, but be SURE TO INCLUDE
your name, address and phone #s for legislators' independent
verification.  Upon receipt by email, I will print and/or fax the
entire message to Bowen and to the legislator(s) to whom you address
it.  (Please allow for that delay.)

LEGI-TECH'S OLDER BROTHER DONE GOOD!
  The McClatchy organization is the owner of Legi-Tech, one of the two
largest online distributors of California legislative information.  They are
also owner of a number of newspapers - their flagship being the powerful
Sacramento Bee.
  On Jul 26th, the Bee ran an editorial *strongly* supportive of AB1624 -
laudable, principled action by The Bee, McClatchy, and presumably by
Legi-Tech in the face of a difficult trade-off between the public's
interests versus their business interests.
  Applause!  Applause!


CALIFORNIA LEGISPEAK: "AUTHOR" VS. "SPONSOR" VS. "SUPPORTER"
  In California legislative circles:
A bill's AUTHOR is a legislator who introduced the bill.
A bill's SPONSOR(S) is a person or organization, if any, that requested that
the bill be introduced by the bill's author.
A bill's SUPPORTER(S) is a person or organization that is officially listed
as being in favor of the bill, usually including its sponsor(s), if any.
  All bills have one or more authors.  Some bills do NOT have sponsors.
  AB1624's author was Assembly Member Debra Bowen.  It had no sponsors, but
has a growing number of supporters.


PROGRAMMERS:  SAMPLE LEGISLATIVE DATA-FILES ALSO AVAILABLE AT CPSR.ORG
  AB1624 Update #19 detailed a set of sample data-files for review and
test-programming, available from Tim Pozar's KUMR.LNS.COM by anonymous ftp.
  As of Jul 22nd, those Legislative Data Center sample files were/are also

     Pornography, said, "Kids are getting this all the time, but
     it's hard for parents to know it's happening because it's
     easy for a child to hide.  You think your kid's a computer
     genius when he's spending hours at a computer, but when he
     has a modem, he has access to a different world, and kids
     are very curious."

<The story cites Lisa Palac, 29, editor of the quarterly magazine
FUTURE SEX, who calls it "cybersex:porn of the next generation."
According to the story, computer porn is becoming big business
with users being charged $25 to $50 year for file access, and
some of the larger services have toll-free 800 numbers.
It indicates that 13 million computer users are connected to
55,000 commercial bulletin boards nationwide, although less than
5 percent, according to the author, are "adult bulletin boards.">

     There is nothing illegal about distributing most forms of
     pornography to adults. Transmission of pornographic
     materials to a minor--whether in print or by computer--is a
     crime, though.

     But the computer pornography industry is so new that law
     enforcement authorities are only now beginning to investigate
     it as more and more bulletin board services begin to operate
     throughout the country.

<The story notes that Steven's mother spent weeks trying to interest
law enforcement officials to pursue the case, including her local PD,
the Illinois State Police, the Cook County sheriff, and the FBI.
Finally, the Cook County state's attorney accepted her complaint,
which resulted in a grant jury indictment.  The BBS sysop is Raymond
F. Netupski, 30, of 10106 Holly Lane, Des Plaines (Ill.), who began
operating his board in 1987.  Netupski's attorney is John J. Seno.
Netupski was indicted for distributing harmful materials to a minor
and obscenity, both misdemeanors. He was also charged with "unlawful
use of sound or audio visual recordings," because some of the
transmitted material was copyright-protected.  The "piracy" charge, a
felony, carries a potential sentence of up to 3 years imprisonment and
a $100,000 fine.

The remainder of the story cites a several law enforcement agents,
sysops, and others, for their comments.

Government and law enforcement agencies have shown a dismal track record
in the area of civil liberties of late.  I have a very hard time
believing, even for a minute, that this vast amount of personal
information will be discarded.

Furthermore, once some kind of 'evidence of benefit' can be wrested from
the selective interpretation of the program's operational record,
pressure will be brought to expand the system to more and more areas.
I've seen mention in this very forum that L.A. intends to expand to GA
and Food Stamp recipients.  California now has a magnetic stripe on
their drivers' licenses.  Will that soon contain your e-fingerprint, as
well?

Don't you agree that this is perhaps a bit too much information to be
collecting on anyone?

Or perhaps you don't see any reason to stop with fingerprints.  Coded
transponders carrying a unique identification number could easily be
implanted, say, at the base of the right thumb.  That would be even
harder to spoof than e-fingerprints.  So why not have all AFDC
recipients implanted with serial numbers?  Hey, we could even make that
number tie in to your credit card numbers, so you'd be safe from fraud.
Make it your ATM card number, and you'd be safe from the shoulder
surfers at the ATM.  And I'm sure you wouldn't mind the occasional
doorknob noting the exact time of your passage.  After all, you're an
honest man with nothing to hide, so it doesn't matter that someone could
effortlessly track your every move.

You see, once this trend gets started, it will grow to envelop us all.
Don't know about you, but I don't want that transponder.  And I'd rather
not be e-fingerprinted, either.

Dear CUD,

       I'd like to thank you for your wonderful journal,and
tell you that it's enjoyed even in Brazil.

       Reading the Time article on CuD 5.59,I couldn't help but
laugh after reading the following:

>One bulletin board, Burn This Flag, requires callers to fill out an
>application before gaining access to an adults-only section that
>contains files describing "bizarre sexual behavior."  But in a written
>message, Burn This Flag's system operator, known as "Zardoz,"
>acknowledges there is no foolproof way to ensure all users of the
>adult section are at least 18.

Does paper adults magazines have any way to "unsure that all
users" of it will be at least 18?To the best of my knowledge,
this magazines are sold openly without directly checking ages(this
"checking" stops at appearance analysis).And that does not consider
what will happen to the magazine AFTER it's sold...

About this kind of assault on BBS reputation,I'd like to say that
it's probably international.Recently,here in Brazil,one of the
biggest newspapers of the country published a article with wild
remarks like these:
"BBS are little stores which sell pirated programs"
"There are 120 pirate BBSs in Sao Paulo"(there aren't even
120 BBS in Sao Paulo!!!)

   These remarks are totally absurd,and most BBS around here
are completely legal(there is a small amount of "underground
BBS"here too),and hurt the BBS community as a whole.

  And the effect of such remarks are much worse here,since
the computer community (and BBSs) are greatly underdeveloped
(taking the USA as a standard).

(Reminder -- We're the folks who are making public-domain Internet
information available on disk, primarily for teachers who have no
access or limited access to the Internet.  We encourage you to make as
many copies of these texts as you need to share with your colleagues
and students.  If you would like to receive a list of our current
offerings, please send us email requesting it.  If you didn't see our
initial message, where we explain what we're doing and why, and who we
are, just let us know and we'll send you a copy of that as well.)

It's been a busy week:
1) All our offerings are now available for Macintosh as well as IBM
PCs.
2) The United Nations Department of Public Information has given its
support to Global Education Motivators (GEM) in our joint project
to make on-line U.N. information available in our PLEASE COPY THIS
DISK format.
3) Your suggestions and requests pointed us to the Educational
Resources Information Center (ERIC) as a possible source for a whole
series of disks about teaching techniques and educational issues, as
well as lesson plans.  4) One of you let us know the importance of
books on disks for the blind, many of whom have equipment which can
"read" such material aloud to them.
5) We've added six new disks.
6) We've learned that in the summer, with people away, obtaining
permissions from sources can take a while.
7) We've been delighted by the enthusiastic response we received.
8) We learned that there simply isn't enough time in the
day to personally respond to everyone.  (Please accept
our apologies, and our thanks for your helpful suggestions.)

We'd appreciate your help in finding sources of information to meet
the particular needs of people who have responded to us.  We are
looking for public-domain on-line sources for:  1) Chaucer, 2) current
information on Africa, and 3) history c. 1850 of importation into the
U.S. of castorbean plants (source of the toxin Ricin, which is
possibly linked to Lou Gehrig's disease) and its use in fertilizer.

The information resources available on the Internet and from the
United Nations are immense.  We need to target our efforts to provide
maximum benefit. For now, we're basing our decisions on the assumption
that some of you would like to use these like textbooks (having
students make their own copies), that others would like to assemble
your own anthologies, and that still others are interested in
government reference tools to encourage students to become informed
and active citizens.  Please let us know as specifically as you can
what information would be most useful for you and your colleagues to
have on disk.

Please send your suggestions as well as your requests to be added to
our distribution list to:  samizdat@world.std.com

# I think I can speak authoritatively about what happened to texsun :-(

# Actually, we have no evidence that anyone broke in through any of the
# modems in Sun's Dallas office (hosts texsun or dallas).  What did
# happen was that one or more people (most likely more) broke in via
# modem to a number of Sun sites around the world (must've had a good
# calling card).  We think that the initial entries were due to the most
# brain-dead of actions on our part: the intruders called us on the phone
# and asked for accounts, and we provided them.  The callers would
# identify themselves as Sun employees on vacation near the local Sun
# office (visiting parents or such) and say that they wanted to login to
# read their email.  They were able to provide enough credible
# information to convince over-worked and under-brained part-time
# sys-admins to create the accounts.  Any one of you who reads USENET
# news can probably gather enough such information from headers and
# signatures (name, title, personal workstation, office phone number,
# etc.) to make the same claims.

# Anyway, once they were in we were totally compromised.  We hadn't done
# much to keep up with security patches.  And we had lots of machines
# with "+" in /etc/hosts.equiv.  And lots of quickly crackable passwords
# on accounts (and NIS accessible password files).  In other words, no
# internal security.  The intruders almost instantly had bunches of other
# accounts to use, and seemed able to find other modem numbers (can you
# say, "directory assistance"?  I thought you could.)

# The next question is, did they damage anything?  Yes.  At the very
# least they stole source code, which is a valuable product.  They also
# deleted stuff, but I don't know what, and may have modified some
# things.  They also crashed machines or in other ways denied service to
# legitimate users.  All of those things are illegal, and damaging.  We
# are doing our best to track the intruders, but it is very difficult, as
# any of you who have tracked intruders knows.

# What we can do is secure our network.  That is why we are removing
# modems from all sales offices and setting up a small number of regional
# modem pools for employee dialup access (with three different and
# non-crackable passwords and dialback).

# I have spent the better part of the last week rebuilding texsun from
# the ground up and doing everything possible to secure it (all security
# patches applied, many services disabled, nothing trusted, security
# monitoring programs running, dialback software installed, etc.).  I
# have finally convinced my management that there is no security risk in
# restoring the UUCP accounts for a short time, allowing our connections
# to make other arrangements and smoothly move over.  The reason it is
# only temporary is that management doesn't want my UUCP modems to be the
# proverbial camel sticking its nose under the tent.  They are very
# serious about strictly limiting the number of entry points into the
# company.

# So there you have it.  Another one bites the dust.  I'm sorry to have
# to pull out of the regional UUCP community, but I can understand Sun's
# needs to maintain a secure environment.  While I agree that a properly
# configured machine running UUCP is not a security risk, Sun's employees
# have repeatedly demonstrated that they will not always properly
# configure machines or employ proper security procedures when creating
# accounts.  The only way for Sun to maintain security is to strictly
# limit access, and that is what we are now doing.  I have enjoyed being
# able to provide what I hope has been a useful service to the community,
# and will miss being a participant.  I will show up to this Month's
# lunch-bunch meeting in case anyone wants to verbally abuse Sun through
# me.
