 PHOENIX, ARIZONA, U.S.A., 1991 APR 1(NB) -- The Maricopa County
 Arizona County Attorney's Office has announced the arrest of Baron
 Majette, 19, also known as "Doc Savage", for alleged crimes uncovered
 in the joint federal / state "SunDevil" investigation in progress for
 over a year.

 Majette is charged with a number of felony crimes including the use
 of a telephone lineman's handset in March 1990 to tap into a Toys 'R
 Us telephone line to set up two conference calls between 15
 participants. According to the charges, each call lasted
 approximately 10 hours and cost $4,000. A spokesperson for the County
 Attorney's office told Newsbytes that a Tucson resident, Anthony
 Nusall, has previously pleaded guilty to being a participant in the
 conference Majette is also accused of illegally accessing TRW's
 credit data base to obtain personal credit information and account
 numbers of persons in the TRW database. He is alleged to have then
 used the information obtained to divert existing account mailings to
 mail drops and post office boxes set up for this purpose. He is also
 alleged to have additional credit cards issued based on the
 information obtained from the database. He is further alleged to have
 obtained cash, goods and services, such as airline tickets, in excess
 of $50,000 by using cards and account information obtained through
 entry into the TRW database.

 It is further alleged that Majette stole credit cars from U.S. Mail
 boxes and used them to obtain approximately $10,000 worth of cash,
 goods and services.The allegations state that Majette acted either
 alone or as part of a group to perform these actions. A County
 Attorney spokesperson told Newsbytes that further arrests may be
 expected as result of the ongoing investigation.

 While bail was set on these charges at $4,900. Majette is being held
 on a second warrant for probation violation and cannot be released on
 bail until the probation hearing has been held.

 Gail H. Thackeray, former Assistant Attorney General for the State of
 Arizona, currently working with Maricopa County on the SunDevil
 cases, told Newsbytes "The SunDevil project was started in response
 to a high level of complaint of communications crimes, credit card
 fraud and other incidents relating to large financial losses. These
 were not cases of persons accessing computers 'just to look around'
 or even cases like the Atlanta 'Legion of Doom' one in which the
 individuals admitted obtaining information through illegal access.
 They are rather cases in which the accused alleged used computers to
 facilitate theft of substantial goods and services."
