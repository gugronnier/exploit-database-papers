Subject:  Hacking in the 90's-the move from active invasions to
          passive listening
To:       tk0jut2

I've been thinking about the future of hacking lately.  Where is it going to
go.  What will it be like in a few years.

Without taking a poll, I think hacking is going to move toward obtaining
information through more passive eavesdropping rather than active invasion of
systems.  Of course, the active invasion could be preceded by a long passive
invasion used to obtain passwords and operating procedures.

Basicly, my argument is this: hackers who invade systems are being detected;
once detected they are often tracked down through the electroinc network
(phone, internet, whatever) and apprehended.  Hackers will try to avoid
detection by using "passive" systems to obtain information.

These passive systems will be either simple line tapping and network
eavesdropping, or the interception of compromising emanations (ELINT/CE).

ELINT/CE circuit schematics are available through the underground and for less
than $200 a hacker can produce a "box" that will "see" what someone is typing
on their terminal from several hundred meters away.  ELINT/CE doesn't require
the physical invasion of an office to place a tap.  It is completely
undetectable and relatively unknown.  Because it is unknown there are _no_
countermeasures in place (except for government activeities with national
security information, many FBI terminals, and many DEA terminals).

Since it is passive, undetectable, and there are no routinely used
countermeasures ELINT/CE represents an extremely safe way to obtain lots of
information.

For the more adventurous there is always phone line tapping and serial line
tapping.  The only drawback here is that the connection to someone's phone line
does requires (often) a bit of trespass, which makes it more likely the hacker
will be caught.

And, of course, there is network tapping.  With an ethernet is this very very
easy (just put your ethernet board in promiscuous mode).  This often requires
legitimate access to the network, but once a hacker has this physical access
there is little information he can not capture.  Since most networks don't
monitor for "new" ethernet boards attached to the cable, an unauthorised
connection can be made with an ethernet net tap.

These are all "old" techniques.  The intelligence agencies have been using them
for a long long time.  All of these techniques all the gathering of a great
deal of information without the associated risk of directly invading
someone's computer.  I think that they will be "the hacking of the 90's" as
more and more hackers are apprehended using the old methods.
