Subject: Moderators' Corner

++++++++++++
Apology to a valuable contributor
++++++++++++

Sometimes letters are published that were not so-intended by the authors to be
published. We indicate in the header that we assume notes may be published,
and as a rule, even though we assume letters may be published, we double check
"just in case." When we ask for a copy of an article or note that someone has
written, we generally assume, whatever wording we use, that it's understood
that it is for publication. Even if a note has been posted publicly on the
nets and an author sends us a copy, we still try to check. Unfortunately,
signals are sometimes crossed and an article slips into publication which an
author prefered to not to be. We regret when this occurs, but it is the result
of legitimate misunderstandings and not the result of any attempt to bypass
author prerogative. Given the amount of mail we receive and weekly schedule, in
addition to net-lag that may delay a response until *after* a post has been
published, miscommunication can arise. We regret such occurances and apologize
to a recent valuable contributor to whom this happened.

+++++++++++++
Corrected NIA Address
+++++++++++++

In the last issue of CuD, the wrong nuchat address for NIA was listed by
mistake. The *CORRECT* address for NIA submissions and correspondence is:
   ELISEM@NUCHAT.SCCSI.COM
We regret any inconvenience caused to those on the mistakenly
listed account.

Intertek: The CyberPunk Journal
+++++++++++++

Call for Articles
+++++++++++++++++

readers on: (1) State of the CU (p/h and pirate) BBS community; (2) Views
on such issues sysop liability on BBSs, e-mail privacy on BBS and mainframe
(university or employer) systems,; and (3) Surveillance of BBSs by local,
state or federal LE agents.
