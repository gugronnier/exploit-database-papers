Subject: Telecoms Ripping off BBSs?

********************************************************************
***  CuD #2.19: File 3 of 7: Telecoms Ripping off BBSs?          ***
********************************************************************

%Moderators' note: A number of states have already begun charging BBSs with
business rates. In some states, this may be a nuisance but not prohibitive.
In Illinois, for example, our own base rate in DeKalb of $24.02 would
increase to $34 were we to run a BBS.  In other states (see following
file), the charges could be prohibitive if multi-line charges required
deposits and other fees. A representative from GTE in Indiana indicated
that they had no formal means of enforcing the charges other than to
investigate if they received reports of an unregistered BBS operating in
their jurisdiction. We have heard of no hobbyist in the U.S. paying for a
business line to run a non-commercial BBS, but the implications, if the
practice is allowed to spread unchecked, are serious. Enforced charges
could be the end of the local or regional Bulletin Board as they currently
exist.

The issue, according to the Indiana spokesperson, is alleged to be one of
fairness and equity in billing. Why, they, ask, should someone whose phone
is in constant use pay the same as somebody who uses their phone only a
fraction of the time? Our response is that there is little, if any, added
expense to telecom operations whether a phone is used for 20 minutes or 20
hours during a given day. Further, the user is already paying an added
charge simply for the receipt of calls. If one adds in toll charges for the
hundreds of thousands of those who call long distance, BBSs generate
considerable revenue for telecom companies. Classifying BBSs as business
lines and increasing the charges strikes us as unabashed greed. Why not
*REDUCE* the rates for BBS lines, which only receive calls and generate
considerable revenue in long distance charges?

This is not a trivial concern. Telephone rates, like all utilities, tend to
rise. The policies identified in the following two files should motivate
all of us to become involved by
  1) Writing letters to local telecom companies
  2) Writing to elected officials
  3) Introducing these campaigns in local and regional elections
  4) Writing to state utililty commissions
  5) Attending and participating in hearings

The following cross-posted information is extracted from alt.cosuard.
Can anyone in Indiana or a closely neighboring state provide any
details on this?

>From: BILL BLOMGREN - Sysop: St. Pete Programmers Exchange RIME: PETEX

Well ... thought I would pass this tidbit of bad news along ...  GTE
Indiana prevailed against the BBS systems there ... ALL BBS's in GTE's
area there are now at BUSINESS RATES. Which means $50 per month base
rates, plus MUCH higher long distance charges.

Indiana Bell ... has filed the same tariff with the PUC (Public
Utilities Commission) there, making it state wide.

Needless to say, GTE has a history of going after the little guy, so
you can expect it here in the REAL near future!  I expect it nation-
wide in the near future.  In Indiana, they decided that THE PHONE
COMPANY can decide that your residence is a business, and charge high
rates to all service incoming.

Unfortunately, the courts agreed with them.

Ain't Monopolies Nice???

  Not a nice situation huh?  We didn't need a precedent to be set like
this ... now this paves the way for other companies to follow suit.
It'll be interesting to watch the nodelist to see if the nets in
Indiana (201 in Lafayette, 227 in South Bend, 230 in the Gary Area,
231 in Indy, 236 in Ft. Wayne/NE IN and 2230 in Terre Haute and 11/15
in Evansville) start shrinking.

See the previous response to Joan for what news there is.

The only thing faster than the speed of light is the manner is which
disinformation about BBS law propagates across the net.

Since the limited information we have suggests this is a PUC decision, it is
still appealable to the courts.  If appealed, it will probably not go into
effect until final judgment.  It's direct effect would only be in Indiana.

The Nebraska PUC might not care a great deal what Indiana did, or it might
give them some value as "persuasive precedent."  The arguments GTE used
might have some value.  They might not.  It all depends on how the
Indiana statutes are worded.  My guess is the fight is over "what is a
business for the purpose of telephone rates?", which will in turn include
"why do businesses pay higher rates than residences?"

The answer to the second is generally "because they use the phone more."
The answer to the first has usually been "some kind of organization that
either makes a profit or has formal nonprofit status."

We all know that successful BBSes use telephone resources more than a
residence, perhaps more than many businesses.  That supports GTEs position.
The fact that they are hobby operations is what complicates the picture,
and the PUC reaction is difficult to predict.

>Comments, suggestions ??

Keep calm and wait for a better report on what happened.
