Cantwell Introduces "Encryption" bill to Expand Export Markets for US
Computer and Software Companies

   US Rep. Maria Cantwell (D-WA) has introduced legislation to amend the
Export Administration Act to allow US computer and software
manufacturers to compete in an international market that could mean as
much as $6 billion to $9 billion a year to American high-tech
industries. Cantwell's bill would liberalize export controls on software
that features encryption capabilities, which protect computer data
against unauthorized disclosure, theft or alteration.

   As communications systems link more and more computers and telephones
around the world, Cantwell said, businesses and indviduals are becoming
more concerned about protecting the privacy of their electronic files,
messages and transactions. She said the worldwide demand for
cryptographic software, and computer systems that employ such software,
is growing rapidly and American companies must be allowed to meet that
demand. According to Cantwell, this legislation is needed to ensure that
American companies do not lose critical international markets to foreign
competitors, who operate with few export restrictions. Currently, more
than 200 software and hardware products for text, file and data
encryption are available from 20 foreign countries.

   "The Export Administration Act has erected a wall between American
high-tech companies and their international customers -- it's time to
lower the wall," Cantwell said. "Computer and software technology are
among the most competitive fields in the world, and American companies
are the clear leaders. To maintain that lead, American companies must be
able to respond to worldwide consumer demand."

   Robert Holleyman, president of the Business Software Alliance, an
association of America's nine leading software companies, applauded
Cantwell for introducing the leigslation and said the bill would "assist
US software companies and maintaining their competitive edge in
international markets."

   Dr. Nathan Myhrvold, senior vice president for Advance Technology at
Microsoft Corporation in Redmond, Washington, also praised Cantwell for
her leadership on this issue.

   "The ability to include encryption features in software we sell
markets," Myhrvold said.  " We commend Rep. Cantwell for recognizing the
importance of this issue to the American software industry."


CANTWELL ON EXPORT CONTROLS/ ADD ONE

    Cantwell said current export controls that prohibit the export of
American software programs that offer good encryption capabilities only
make it harder for American companies to compete internationally.  She
said the regulations ignore the realities of today's post-Cold War
global economy and the needs of one of this country's most innovative
and successful industries.  American software companies currently
command a 75 percent worldwide market share, and many of those companies
earn more than 50 percent of their annual revenues from exports, but
Cantwell said that could change quickly.

     "The United States' export control system is broken and needs to be
fixed," Cantwell said.  "It was designed as a tool of the Cold War, to
help America fight against enemies that no longer exist.  If we continue
to prevent American companies from meeting the worldwide demand for
cryptographic software, America gains nothing -- but those companies
stand to lose $6 billion and $9 billion a year."

     Paul Brainerd, CEO of Aldus in Seattle, said, "Rep. Cantwell's bill
would liberalize outdated export controls, which are threatening the
continued success of America's software companies in world markets.  In
order to remain competitive worldwide, American companies must be able
to offer features -- like information security -- demanded by our
customers and available from foreign companies."

     Cantwell said her legislation would not interfere with the
government's ability to control exports to nations with terrorist
tendencies (such as Iran, Libya and Syria) or other embargoed countries
(such as Cuba and North Korea).  On the other hand, she said, current
export controls on American software do not prevent anyone from
obtaining cryptographic software.

     "Much of this is ordinary shrink-wrapped software," Cantwell said,
"the kind millions of people buy every day for their home and business
computers at regular retail outlets.  International consumers who cannot
purchase American computer systems and software programs with encryption
features don't do without, they just buy those products elsewhere.  They
are concerned with protecting their privacy and keeping their businesses
secure."

     Cantwell said she is determined to bring the issue out from behind
closed doors and into the light of public debate before the House
Subcommittee on Economic Policy, Trade and Environment marks up the
Export Administration Act early next year.  She said she hopes her bill
will encourage the Administration to act quickly to revise export
controls on software -- perhaps before Congress reconvenes in late
January.

     "The Administration is reviewing this issue, and I think they are
interested in making the changes that will allow American companies to
remain competitive," Cantwell said.  "I would like nothing better than
to come back to Congress after the recess and discover that the problem
had been solved."

                              ###





AMERICAN COMPUTER COMPANIES MUST BE ALLOWED TO
EXPORT SOFTWARE WITH ENCRYPTION CAPABILITIES


_Introduction and Summary_

America's computer software and hardware companies, including such
well-known companies as Apple, DEC, Hewlett-Packard, IBM, Lotus,
Microsoft, Novell and Wordperfect, have been among the country's most
internationally competitive firms earning more than one-half of their
revenues from exports.  Unfortunately, this vital American industry is
directly threatened by unilateral U.S. Government export controls which
prevent those companies from meeting worldwide user demand for software
that includes encryption capabilities to protect computer data against
unauthorized disclosure, theft or alteration.  Legislative action is
needed to ensure that American companies do not lose critical
international markets to foreign software companies that operate without
significant export restrictions.


_The Problem_

With ready access to powerful, interconnected, computers, business and
home users increasingly are relying on electronic information storage
and transmissions to conduct their affairs.  At the same time, computer
users worldwide are demanding that computer software offer encryption
capabilities to ensure that their data is secure and its integrity is
maintained.

Unfortunately, current unilateral U.S. "munitions" export controls
administered by the National Security Agency and the State Department
effectively prohibit the export of American software programs offering
good encryption capabilities.

Yet these unilateral U.S. controls are _not_ effective in restricting
the availability of encryption abroad.  More than 200 generally
available, mass-market foreign commercial programs and products, as well
as many programs available from the Internet, all offer good encryption.
In addition, generally available software with encryption capabilities
is sold within the U.S. at thousands of retail outlets, by mail and over
the phone.  These programs may be transferred abroad in minutes by
anyone using a public telephone line and a computer modem.

The only result of continued U.S. export controls is to threaten the
continued preeminence of America's computer software and hardware
companies in world markets.  American software companies stand to lose
between $6 and $9 billion in annual revenues from sales of generally
available software. In addition, American hardware companies are losing
hundreds of millions of dollars in computer system sales every year,
because sales increasingly are dependent on the ability of a U.S. firm
to offer encryption as a feature of an integrated customer solution
involving hardware, software and services.


_The Solution_

Legislation introduced by U.S. Rep. Maria Cantwell would ensure that
exports of software with encryption capabilities would be controlled by
the Secretary of Commerce as a commercial item and would be exportable.
This legislation is strongly supported by the Business Software Alliance
and the Industry Coalition on Technology Transfer.


-----------------------------------------------------------------------

SECTION-BY-SECTION ANALYSIS OF CANTWELL BILL
EXPORT CONTROL LIBERALIZATION FOR
INFORMATION ECURITY PROGRAMS AND PRODUCTS


_Section 1_

Section 1 amends the Export Administration Act by adding a new
subsection that specifically addresses exports of computer hardware,
software and technology for information security including encryption.
The new subsection has three basic provisions:

1) It gives the Secretary of Commerce exclusive authority over the
export of such programs and products except those which are specifically
designed for military use, including command, control and intelligence
applications or for deciphering encrypted information.

2) The Government is generally prohibited from requiring a validated
export license for the export of generally available software (e.g. mass
market commercial or public domain software) or computer hardware simply
because it incorporates such software.
Nevertheless, the Secretary will be able to continue controls on
countries of terrorists (like Lybia, Syria and Iran) or other embargoed
countries (like Cuba and North Korea) pursuant to the Trading With The
Enemy Act os the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (except for
instances where IEEPA is employed to extend EAA-based controls when the
EAA is not in force).

3) The Secretary is required to grant validated licenses for exports of
sotware to commercial users in any country to which exports of such
software has been approved for use by foreign financial institutions.
Importantly, the Secretary is not required to grant such export
approvals if there is substantial evidence that the software will be
diverted or modified for military or terrorists' end-use or re-exported
without requisite authorization.


_Section 2_

Section 2 provides definitions necessary for the proper implementation
of the substantive provisions.  For example, generally available
software is offered for sale or licensed to the public without
restriction and available through standard commercial channels of
distribution; sold as is without further customization; and designed to
be installed by the purchaser without additional assistance from the
publisher.  Computer hardware and computing devices are also defined.

In Cu Digest, #5.89, Michael Roberts <nagap@mindvox.phantom.com>
forwarded a message entitled "A Psychopunk's Manifesto," which
contains a byline of "...by T.C. Hughes."

This "document" has already made its rounds in the cypberspatial world
and its originator has stirred up quite a bit of trouble by incessant
claims of conspiracy in the .cypherpunks agenda.

CuD readers should be aware that "T.C. Hughes" does not exist; this
"manifesto" is a psuedospoof in itself. The "T.C. Hughes" moniker is
an apparent conjugation of the real identities of Tim May and Eric
Hughes (who, in fact, did not author the original message), who
started the .cypherpunks mailing list. The message, if memory serves
me correctly, was originally composed by an12070, an anonymous
harbinger at penet.fi, who has appeared under several alaises,
including Medusa, The Executioner, S.Boxx and more recently, The
Pervert.

Looks like the psuedospoof has come home to roost.

Subject: File 4--re: Student sues to regain Internet access (CuD 5.88)

A recent CuD article reports on the case of Gregory Steshenko, who was
terminated by Microsoft for some of his network postings, then began
posting from his University of Texas account, and is now suing the
university when it responded to complaints by removing his account (or
at least his network posting privileges).  Mr. Steshenko claims First
Amendment protections, and the article quotes various "electronic
frontier" personalities describing this as an important case for free
speech on the networks.

It bothers me how little thought these spokesmen appear to be giving
to the effects of what they are defending.  The Internet has been
described as an anarchy, but in fact only relatively small parts of
the Internet are actually anarchic.  Most of the Internet, in fact, is
better described as self-governing.  There are a variety of social
norms concerning network use and interactions.  One doesn't post
messages to unrelated groups.  One doesn't evade moderation
restrictions.  One maintains a certain (rather limited, it must be
admitted) degree of restraint in how one describes other network
participants.  There are few effective mechanisms for enforcing these
norms, and they are certainly broken on an all-too-regular basis; but
the network continues to function because social pressure *can* be
applied to those who become too annoying; and in the most outrageous
cases, it's possible to remove the offenders' access to the net.  I
can cite two specific examples of this in the recent past:

        - A regular poster to the INFO-VAX mailing list lost patience with
                some of the sillier postings appearing there and began to
                berate those who asked "dumb" questions.  As time went on,
                his postings became more and more abusive, and eventually a
                fair amount of bandwidth was being used in debates about his
                postings, rather then the technical issues that group is list
                is meant to discuss.  The list maintainer, who's been very
                "hands-off" over the years, asked the abuser to tone things
                down.  This drew a characteristically insulting response.
                The list maintainer modified the forwarding software to
                block all postings by this person.

                Needless to say, cries of "censorship!" were heard for a while
                (though not, interestingly enough, from the person being
                censored; to his credit, he had a message forwarded to the
                list acknowledging the right of the list maintainer to do what
                he had done) - but the list soon settled back to more useful
                issues.

        - Someone posted messages ostensibly asking for information about some
                sex phone lines - but in fact really acting as ads for those
                lines.  The messages were posted to every single Usenet news
                group.  The person's account was removed after multiple
                complaints to his system manager.  He then obtained an account
                on a different system, and started his postings again.  This
                time, his account was removed rather quickly.  He's been
                quiet since.

Depending on how you look at these two incidents, they either
represent self-government or censorship.  My own view is that it's the
former.  No community can exist without some degree of self definition
and regulation.  It's all too easy to disrupt a discussion; all it
takes is a powerful and insistent voice.  That's not hard to acquire
on the network; all it takes is the willingness to spend time typing.
(In the case of the sex phone line ads, all it took was a dumb program
to walk the list of newsgroups.)

I expect Mr. Steshenko will probably prevail:  Individualism is a
strong thread in our political and legal history, and is exteremely
powerful in the area of free speech.  Even if he loses his lawsuit,
he'll get Internet access in some other form, and continue his
(according to the original article) offensive postings and other
actions.  Some will cheer this as an extension of First Amendment
rights to electronic media.  I think it makes an excellent example of
why "First Amendment rights" should *not* be blindly extended to all
electronic media without careful analysis.

I can ignore a leaflet or newspaper; I can choose not to stop and
listen to a speaker on a public street.  It's much harder to be quite
so accepting of loudspeakers at 3:00 AM, or of repeated harranging
telephone calls.  And, indeed, speech using the latter modalities is
much more tightly regulated than that using the former.  Where do the
electronic media fall?  I submit they fall somewhere in between:
Messages are more easily ignored than, say, people who show up at
meetings and spend all their time shouting about their pet peeve, but
in large enough volume inappropriate messages are at least as damaging
to discourse.  Private Email is more easily ignored than telephone
calls, but either can constitute harrassment.  (While in principle,
direct speech can also be harrassing, except for recent "political
correctness" cases, it's not easy to find even claims of harrassment
in this form.  Phone harrassment, on the other hand, is seen enough in
need of regulation that you can find quotations from tarriffs and laws
touching on the matter in the front of any phone book.)

But does the U. of Texas at Dallas interpret and apply this policy
consistently or does it single out offensive speech for punishment?

Any institution that calls itself a university should interpret
"educational purposes" broadly. The "Joint Statement on Rights and
Freedoms of Students", the main statement of academic freedom for U.S.
students, says:

   Academic institutions exist for the transmission of knowledge, the
   pursuit of truth, the development of students, and the general
   well-being of society. Free inquiry and free expression are
   indispensable to the attainment of these goals. As members of the
   academic community, students should be encouraged to develop the
   capacity for critical judgment and to engage in a sustained and
   independent search for truth.

>From what I know of Steshenko's postings, they easily fits this broad
interpretation of "educational".

>Why does he think he can get away from this at a government-run
>facility, when he couldn't at Microsoft?

Because like any organization, the U. of Texas must work within its
charters, these include the U.S. Constitution. The U.S. Supreme Court
has said that this limits the Government's authority to control the
media that owns and controls.  The rationale is that it would be
dangerous for a Government that is elected by the people to have too
much control on the content of what people read and write.

The Supreme Court calls created forums, like a student newspaper or
campus mail systems, limited public forums. It says that the
government can limited who may access these forums and/or what topics
may be discussed. But otherwise, "it is bound by the same standards as
apply in a traditional public forum"; "content-based prohibition must
be narrowly drawn to effectuate a compelling state interest."

_Public Schools Law: Teachers' and Students' Rights_ 2nd Ed. by Martha
M. McCarthy and Nelda H. Cambron-McCabe says:
   "Although school boards are not obligated to support student
   papers, if a given publication was originally created as a free speech
   forum, removal of financial or other school board support can be
   construed as an unlawful effort to stifle free expression. In essence,
   school authorities cannot withdraw support from a student publication
   simply because of displeasure with the content. In an illustrative
   case, the Eight Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that a university could
   not change its funding policy for a student paper based on the 'hue
   and cry' of the public objecting to a particular issue [Stanley v.
   Magrath, 719 F.2d 279, 282-283 (8th Cir. 1983).]

Subject: File 6--Commentary on Cyber-issues in Elansky/Ionizer Sentence

               IIRG RESPONSE TO THE ELANSKY SENTENCING

The sentencing of Michael Elansky to 28 months in prison makes us
wonder who will be the next victim of our judicial system. Although we
may not agree with Judge Miano's ruling on the alleged probation
violations, we can understand the ruling resulted mainly due to
Miano's lack of knowledge in the field of telecommunications. The
initial charges that were the reason for Mike's arrest were dropped.
Given this, we wonder just how he violated his probation. It makes no
sense to us, nor to the many people we've consulted. Our main concerns
now are the terms of Mike's probation:

1. A ban preventing anyone under 18 years of age to use Elansky's
   computer bulletin board, The Ware House.

This is an interesting idea. How does the Judge propose that Mike
enforce this? If a simple statement of age at logon is expected to be
enough, then this ruling is essentially unenforceable.  A 13 year old
child can simply logon as a 35 year old adult.

On the other hand, if the Judge expects mail in registrations with a
photo-copy of a driver's license m from his users, this would defeat
the purpose of running the board in the first place, which is to
promote free exchange of information and ideas between the users under
the freedom which anonymity provides. Unfortunately, many systems have
been forced to adopt this policy.

2. A ban on Elansky (Ionizer) placing pyrotechnic information or any
   other "harmful" information on his bulletin board.

It would be difficult to cite a more blatant example of First
Amendment infringement than the above. "Harmful" is an utterly
subjective term entirely open to interpretation. Harmful to whom or to
what? And just who would be charged with determining whether or
not a particular piece of information is "harmful?" In addition,
according to mandate one, there would be no users under the age of 18.
Aren't adults entitled to freedom from government censorship, or is
this becoming another Red China? Where's the EFF when you need them?

3. A requirement that a probation officer have complete freedom to
   search Elansky's computer system to ensure the requirements have
   not been violated.

Does this mean Mike must grant sysop access to a probation officer?
We personally know of no sysop that would like an untrained, computer
illiterate individual rummaging through his BBS. "Big Brother"
conspiracy freaks will love this one.

We only hope that in future cases, courts will become more educated as
to the inner workings of the BBS community. If the current trend
continues, we can only see a gross violation of personal privacy in
the future.

Will the proposed "Information Super-Highway" become a super
speed-trap?
