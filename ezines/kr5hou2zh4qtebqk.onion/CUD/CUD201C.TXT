          LAWSUIT SEEKS FBI RECORDS ON COMPUTER MONITORING
 
Computer Professionals for Social Responsibility filed a lawsuit in
Federal District Court today to obtain information from the FBI about the
monitoring of computer bulletin boards.
 
Marc Rotenberg, director of the CPSR Washington Office, said that the
disclosure of the records would provide a starting point for an informed
discussion about the proper scope of computer crime investigations.  He
said that the FBI's failure to respond to CPSR's original Freedom of
Information Act request made the lawsuit necessary.
 
A computer bulletin board is a publicly accessible computer system that is
designed to promote the exchange of views and information.  Computer
bulletin boards are also used for confidential communications that are
directed to one or more specific parties.
 
The Freedom of Information Act provides a legal right for individuals to
obtain records held by government agencies.  Under the law, agencies are
required to respond within ten working days.  When agencies fail to respond
within a reasonable period of time, requesters often begin legal
proceedings to obtain the information.
 
CPSR filed the original FOIA request in August, 1989.  After a series of
letters from CPSR to the FBI failed to produce a response, the FOIA request
was considered at a Congressional hearing in February, 1990.  A subsequent
letter from the Treasury Department revealed that the Secret Service was in
fact monitoring computer bulletin boards.  The FBI's activities are still
not known.
 
The lawsuit comes at a time of growing concern over the conduct of
computer crime investigations directed toward "computer hackers." In one
case, charges were dropped against a newsletter publisher after claims that
a confidential  business document was disclosed turned out to be false.  In
another case a game manufacturer in Austin, Texas suffered substantial
business losses after a Secret Service raid earlier this year, though no
charges were ever brought against the owner or his company.
 
The case is CPSR v. FBI. Civil Action No. 90-2096, U.S. District Court for
the District of Columbia, August 28.
