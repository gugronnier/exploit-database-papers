***  CuD #3.12: File 4 of 4: Using the CuD mailserver            ***
********************************************************************

A note about the e-mail archive server at chsun1.uchicago.edu:

please send any and all requests for files/help to:
        archive-server@chsun1.uchicago.edu

this is not the address for receiving the latest issue of CuD from the
mailing list.  Either subscribe to alt.society.cu-digest on USEnet or
send mail to TK0JUT2@NIU.BITNET (although I'm not sure, you might be able
to do uunet!NIU.BITNET!TK0JUT2 if you do not have a definition for .BITNET
sites).

The archive server is automated and it only understands a few commands placed
in the body of the message you send.  These commands are HELP, INDEX, SEND,
and PATH (case doesn't matter).  In short:

help:   sends a help file describing each command in detail
index:  sends an index of available topics.  If the topic is on the same
        line, it will send a detailed index of that topic.  Available CuD
        topics are:

          ane ati bootlegger chalisti cud hnet law lod narc network
          nia papers phantasy phrack phun pirate school synd tap
send:   sends a file.  Commands for send must be in the following format:
           send topic filename
           send topic filename1 filename2 filename3 ...

        Please note that the arguments are separated by spaces, not slashes
        or any other characters.  Also, some mailers between this site and
        yours might not be able to handle mail messages larger than 50k in
        size.  You will have to make special arrangements to receive these
        files (see address below).
path:   This command forces a specified return path.  Normally, the server
        will guess what the return address should be (most of the time,
        successfully), but in some cases, it will cause the requested
        files to bounce, leaving you without your files.  If this is the
        case, you should use the path command to set the return address.
        Please note, the mailer here cannot handle .uucp addresses, these
        addresses must be fully expanded.  Here are some examples:
           path user@host.bitnet         [for BITNET hosts, direct]
           path user%hosta.major.domain@hostb.major.domain
           path hosta!hostb!hostc@uunet.uu.net

some useful commands to give to the server (once you know your mailing
address is OK) are:

send cud cud-arch
      which sends the master Index for the CuD archive.
send cud chsun1.email.files
      which sends a directory of all files that are in the CuD archives by
      topic, filename, size of the file, and other less useful information.
      This file is updated whenever new files are added to the archives.

If you have any problems and wish to have someone help you with the server,
please send mail to:
        archive-management@chsun1.uchicago.edu
(also   cudarch@chsun1.uchicago.edu)
