***  CuD #2.10: File 7 of 9: Obtaining "Identification Cards"   ***
********************************************************************

{An anonymous poster sent this in from the nets. He did not know
the original poster--moderators}.

This from the Federal Register published 11-28-73, amended to 4-29-86:

"Section 16.32,  Procedure to obtain an identification record.

The subject of an identification record may obtain a copy thereof by
submitting a written request via the U.S. mails directly to the FBI,
Identification Division, Washington, D.C. 20537-9700, or may present his/her
written request in person during regular business hours to the FBI
Identification Division, Room 11262, J. Edgar Hoover FBI Building, Tenth
Street and Pennsylvania Avenue, NW., Washington, DC. Such request must be
accompanied by satisfactory proof of identity, which shall consist of name,
date and place of birth and a set of rolled-inked fingerprint impressions
placed upon fingerprint cards or forms commonly utilized for applicant or law
enforcement purposes by law enforcement agencies."

"An FBI identification record, often referred to as a "rap sheet", is a
listing of certain information taken from fingerprint cards submitted to and
retained by the FBI  in connection with arrests and in some instances,
includes information taken from fingerprint cards submitted in connection with
Federal employment, naturalization, or military service..."

The fee for this exercise was, in 1986, $14.00; payable in the form a
certified check or money order to the Treasury of the United States. A
provision for waiver of this fee is available on proof of indigency. The
report and the submitted fingerprint card are returned to the requestor by
regular mail in approximately two weeks after receipt.
