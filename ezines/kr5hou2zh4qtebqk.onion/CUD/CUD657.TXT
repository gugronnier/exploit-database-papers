Subject: File 2--Response to Loka Inst. NII views (CuD 6.50)

In #6.50, Richard Sclove and Jeffrey Scheuer of the "Loka Institute"
wrote, after several pages of moaning about how the awful highways
had destroyed America's cities and now the information highway would
finish the job and blah blah blah:

>     o  _No Innovation Without Evaluation_:  To help reduce adverse
>social impact, the federal government should mandate evaluated social
>trials of alternative electronic services.  Analogous to environmental
>impact statements, these trials should precede full-scale deployment

Rich. The "environmental impact statement" is a joke, a bureaucratic
maneuver, an expensive time-waster. We need more of these?
By the time our pork-glutted feds could pass the enabling legislation to
form the committee to name the study group to design those "trials,"
the whole infrastructure will have been deployed . . . somewhere else.

Your whole metaphor is flawed. You start by pointing out problems caused
by the massive, pork-barrel, FEDERAL Interstate Highway project . . .
and from that, you argue that the infobahn should be federally taxed
and controlled? "It didn't work last time, so let's do it again." Huh?

>     o  _No Innovation Without Regulation_:  We should conserve
>cultural space for face-to-face social engagement, traditional forms

Right. More taxes. And what wise, caring group will decide
which "social," "traditional," and "leisure" activities get the pork?
The Feds, of course. Congress. Oh, I quiver with anticipation.

>     Data highway enthusiasts may see such measures as wasteful
>obstructions of market forces.  But what entrepreneurs call red tape
>is really democracy in action.

No. What entrepreneurs call "red tape" is red tape. What the Lokoids
call "democracy in action" is officious, statist paternalism.
Get your hands the hell out of my pockets, and get your red tape the
hell off of my infobahn. You can call yourselves "liberal" and
"democratic," but you're just another tentacle of the federal octopus.
If you can't confiscate our computers, maybe you can just tax, study
and regulate them right out of existence . . . is that it?

I hate to disappoint the Loka gentlemen, but the market is already at
work, and the market is worldwide. If you really want universal access
to the information highway, you'll go find some other Cause and let
the entrepreneurs keep on . . . until it's so cheap that everybody has
it, and so simple that everybody can understand it . . . and keep
your government out of our faces.

Subject: File 3--Response to "Egalitarianism as Irrational" (CuD 5.51)

In response to File 1 in CU-Digest 6.51.

> I would like to take this opportunity to state that I
> believe egalitarianism, in regard to information
> technology as elsewhere, is an irrational, immoral, and
> dangerous ideal.

  Sorry, are you playing devil's advocate or am I really missing a
really fundamental point, such as, perhaps, an argument to back up
this belief? Let us look at the above statement.

  Apparently equal access to IT is an irrational ideal. It could be
argued, I suppose, that since it can't happen it's irrational to
expect it to happen. Surely though, having an unattainable ideal is
not inherently irrational. So what makes it an irrational ideal?

  Now the next point concerns that most subjective of all things -
morality. A fair system in which everyone has equal say and equal
influence is, apparently, immoral. Presumably then, morally speaking,
we should remove certain people's right to 'speech'. If we don't feel
too strongly about what they 'say' on the internet or just to be kind,
we might merely restrict some of them. This does, to me, seem to be
analogous to removing some people's right to post letters or
disallowing them from using the 'phone. In my country (Britain) people
who are supposedly associated with Irish terrorists, such as, for
instance, the entirity of the (legitimate) Sinn Fein political party
are not allowed to have their voice on TV. These are the people, then
who's connection to the internet should be somehow reduced.  Really?
Are you sure? You'd better be.

  The final point was dangerous. Obviously, if we allow people that
know how to make bombs to post to the net, we'd be endagering people's
lives. Better stop the military posting then.

  I can understand your point on one level only. There are capitalist
pressures which will dictate people's usage.  However, I think
people's right to the internet should be guaranteed. It may just be,
that as with 'phones and mail, some people can not afford to use them
as much as others. In my opinion, that is unfair, but unavoidable in a
free market oriented culture.

Date: Thu, 16 Jun 94 7:46:56 GMT

                          INTERNET IN FRANCE

For a long time, I dream to have an Internet address. For an US guy,
it's easy to answer to this request. For me, France-born teenager, I
must have a friend that give me an email box on the computer of a rich
university. At this time, a lot of controls stop like a solution.

The second solution is to access via my free videotex terminal called
Minitel on a gatheway connected to an UUCP or Internet node. The cost
is between FF 1.25 (for 3615 Internet) and FF 9.46 (for 3619 USnet)
pro minute... but for email and news only. Some videotex services
don't like ftpmail requests or more than 520-caracters messages (like
3617 Email) and refuse sending my mails :-8

The third solution is to buy a commercial access: MCIMail have an
"experimental connexion with Internet" at this time, AT&T give you an
address in Netherlands and CompuServe ask for my... parent's
MasterCard number :-]

Some good associations (like French Data Network, Fnet or Frmug) send
me a little package with a good service, but the guys that don't live
in Paris paid a lot of money for an incredible expensive phone call
(FF 0.73 all 12 seconds) to
access to the service.

The only solution is 3619 USnet (a joke developed by Intel-
matique, a subsidiary of France Telecom that give you an
user-id on Delphi domain), the really crazy Audiotel service called FranceNet
(that stop the service all 20 minutes),
the last baby born today and called World-net or, at least,
the uncredible 3619 Inet that give you an email box on
"on101"-domain in the USA.

Internet is a real *problem* at this time in France, not a
solution. This message cost me FF 25.00 to be send to you.
A little expensive, no?

For immediate release
20 June 1994

                        CPSR Lends Support to
         National Computer Ethics and Responsibility Campaign

In a step toward recognizing and encouraging the responsible use of
computing, Computer Professionals for Social Responsibility (CPSR) today
announced its support for the National Computer Ethics and
Responsibility Campaign (NCERC).  The purpose of NCERC is to promote
discussion and dissemination of information on computer ethics and
related issues.

In endorsing NCERC, CPSR joins a diverse group of supporters and
affiliates, including the Computer Ethics Institute, the Electronic
Messaging Association, Monsanto, Merrill Lynch, and others, in
expressing the need to raise awareness of the many consequences of
increased computer use.

CPSR and NCERC share a common interest in the ethical use of information
technology.  Moreover, we believe that by providing the necessary tools
and resources, NCERC will enable individuals and organizations to make
intelligent, informed choices on how best to develop, manage, and
utilize the rapidly expanding information resources available through
electronic networks.

Subject: File 6--Groups Hail New Bill For Public Space on NII

This is a press release put out by People for the American Way and the
Media Access Project last week. Additional information, including a copy
of the legislation, will be put online shortly.

June 15, 1994


       PUBLIC INTEREST GROUPS HAIL INTRODUCTION OF BILL TO
     PROVIDE "PUBLIC LANE" ON THE INFORMATION "SUPERHIGHWAY"

                PEOPLE FOR CALLS BILL "VITAL" TO
               DEVELOPMENT OF HIGH-TECH DEMOCRACY

           MEDIA ACCESS PROJECT SAYS NON-PROFITS NEED
             TO GET ON NOW, NOT IN FIVE OR TEN YEARS


     Public interest groups expressed enthusiastic support for S. 2195,
legislation introduced today by Senator Daniel Inouye (D-HI) to ensure
that there will be space on the "information superhighway" for schools,
libraries, public broadcasters, and non-profit organizations which
promote local artistic, political and social speech.

     Senate Communications Subcommittee Chairman Inouye's bill guarantees
access on the "superhighway" for non-commercial and governmental uses.
"Without this protection, we may not get anything besides home shopping
and movies on demand," said Leslie Harris, Director of Public Policy for
the People For the American Way Action Fund (PFAWAF).  "Senator Inouye's
bill creates an electronic `public square' where diverse political,
artistic and cultural expression can flourish.  It is vital to ensuring
that the interests of the public are not left behind on the information
`superhighway.'"

     Andrew Jay Schwartzman, Executive Director of the Media Access
Project (MAP), underscored the short-term impact of Senator Inouye's
proposal.  "We hope -- and expect -- that some day the new technologies
will provide so much capacity at such low prices that there will be no
need to reserve space for public use.  The bill directs the Federal
Communications Commission to phase out the `public right of way' if and
when that happens." But, he added, "It is critical that local government
and non-profit groups have access to the new technologies right away.
We need to begin using the technologies as they evolve; it will be too
late to do this five or ten years from now."

     Potential uses of this capacity are innumerable, according to PFAWAF
and MAP.  Among them are distance learning (in which master teachers can
work with students locally and nationwide) and interactive information
services such as the video health referral system established by the
Chicago Chapter of the Black Nurses Association.  Similarly, performing
arts groups could distribute their works on these systems using an
upgraded version of the currently operative Arts Wire.  PFAWAF and MAP
are especially enthusiastic about the Los Angeles-based Democracy Network,
an on-line interactive multimedia political communication prototype which
could help reduce the cost of running for public office by creating
high-tech voter information services, in which all qualified candidates
could respond to citizen inquiries, "post" biographical information,
video clips of their speeches and position statements, and the public
can participate on video bulletin and issue boards.

     People For the American Way Action Fund is a 300,000-member
nonpartisan constitutional liberties organization.

     Media Access Project is a twenty-one year old non-profit public
interest telecommunications law firm which seeks to promote the
public's First Amendment rights to speak and be heard.

--

As Senator Inouye stated when introducing the bill, "nearly 100
educational, public broadcasting, library, civil rights, labor, local
government, and disability rights organizations and others have expressed
their support for the principles outlined in this legislation."

This coalition is asking organizations and individuals to write
the Senate in support of S. 2195. Sample letters to Senator Inouye,
Senator Hollings, and your individual Senators will also put placed online
shortly.

I am about to switch jobs.  My current job 'allows' me to conduct any
business I wish on my own time, as long as it doesn't *COMPETE* with
any current or near-future business plans.

My new job, however, has a strongly worded statement in the "Employee
Guidelines" that says (HIGHLY paraphrased and condensed):

 'We are a high-performance, high-output team.  Because we demand the
most possible from our employees, we ask that you engage in no other
business activities than what is part of your job.  If you want more
money, or to do something different, come ask us -- we've got plenty
of work to go around.'

Does Radio Shack have any such clauses in their working agreement?

Also, is it possible that this is a coverup for an employee being
fired for other reasons?  I've worked at more than one place where it
was easier to fire an employee over some minor infraction of the rules
than for the 'real' reason (incompetence, theft, fraud).

                         E-MAIL FEMALE FOR A DAY

                                   by
                              K.K.Campbell


To get a glimpse of how the other-sex lives, people have tried pop
psychology, role-playing, cross-dressing, even sex-change operations.
Such inefficiency.

Me? I just had to use a computer.

Some years ago, I was researching a story about "computer-chat" systems
-- better known as bulletin board systems, or just BBSs for short.  By
hooking your dusty home computer to your telephone by a a modem, then
dialing certain phone numbers, you can talk to complete strangers.
You'll see their typing on your monitor.  And they see yours.

Anyway, in this research I noticed, to my chagrin, that there are many
BBSs females can call free, which males have to pay to use.  Since
writing makes one just enough money to starve by degrees, a friend,
Elisa, graciously let me use her account.  A female account.  I could
call free.

The only condition she set was that I tell no one I wasn't her.  If the
person who ran the BBS found out she was letting a male use her account,
she would get deleted.

Effectively, by using her account, I was transformed from a 6'4" male
into a 5'1" female -- whose hobbies, as stated in the little
biographical profile she'd written for others to read, included: "gazing
at the stars with a special someone."

So call I did.

And WHAM! It starts almost immediately: "chat requests" from males.
Little notes on my screen saying -- "So-and-so is requesting you for a
private chat." I can only imagine what they want, so pay no attention
and go about trying to learn my way around the system.  But this one guy
named Jeff is absolutely relentless.

I couldn't tell him I wasn't Elisa (I promised, I promised).  I just did
my best to ignore him.  He'd surely quit -- right?  Men are polite --
right?

After chat request number 31, Jeff switchs tactics and starts sending me
little notes.  Messages only I can see.

The first message reads: "Are you new here?"

A variation on the timeless, "Come here often?", I suppose.

"Who _is_ this guy?" I ask aloud.  I go to the area where all the little
biography are stored and look up Jeff's profile.  It scrolls onto my
monitor:

  Description: 30-years-old, 5'9", 200 lbs, with very short, black hair.
  Hobbies:  Sex, stereos, electronics, sex, making love to
            beautiful women.
  Favorite movies:  All, especially sex movies!
  Sports:  Sex.  Sex.
  Favorite Reading:  Playboy.

  (There was other stuff about him being a computer programmer.)

I stare at the screen, truly awestruck, flooded with flashbacks of grade
school and pictures of naked women carved into desktops with ball-point
pens.

Meanwhile, Jeff's personal message barrage keeps pounding away at my
bunker walls.

"Need some help?"

"Elisa your real name?"

"Please chat - something important to say!!!!"

It begins to dawn on me that Jeff is simply not going to leave me alone.
"Stop being a weenie, Jeff," I growl at the terminal.  More than just
annoy, he's really beginning to piss me off.  He is _only_ acting this
way because he thinks I'm female.  If there was a "male" designation on
the screen beside my name, Jeff would not bothered me after the second
ignore, if he would have noticed me at all.

A new message beeps onto the screen:

"Make love!"

At this, I blink it in disbelief.  What, precisely, is ol' Jeff trying
to say, here?  Is this some general statement on his life philosophy...
or does Jeff imagine he is now coming in for the seductive kill?

Before I can decide, yet another message appears:

"xxx-4238."

His phone number.  He is giving me his phone number.  I have not once
even acknowledged his existence on Planet Earth...  and he is giving me
his phone number.

That did it!

You want to chat so bad, okay, pal, I'll chat.  Even if I have to
pretend to be a 5'1" female, fine, I'll be a 5'1" female and tell him
what a defective representative of the male species he is.

I figure out how to accept chat requests, and sit, glowering at the
screen, waiting, waiting.  Sure enough, a chat request comes in and I'm
whisked off to personal chat.  One on one.

I watch him type that first sentence, ready to DefCon5 this dink's
ego...  when the twisted smile is wiped from my face.

_It isn't Jeff!_

This is some other guy named Albert, whom I have never heard of before.
Someone _else_ asked me to chat!  My mind raced.

It was then I realized, in horror, I didn't know how to _leave_ personal
chat.

"Um, hi," I type, trying to extricate myself.  "I didn't mean to chat
with you.  I think I hit the wrong key by mistake.  I'm new at this BBS.
How do I leave chat?"

Bad move.  Delighted at my apparent stupidity, Albert decides to take me
under his protective wing.  He isn't going to take the polite brush-off.
Instead, he starts heaping doting advice and condescending pep talks
upon me -- "If you have any problems, come to me first", "Beware, some
of these guys are perverts", "You are as good as anyone here, just
remember that!" I am unsure if Albert thinks me an idiot or a turn-on...
or both.

But Albert is the least of my troubles.  My going into chat with a male
is apparently a signal for every male online to chat-request me.  "Tony"
and "Jim" have started hitting me up.  I desperately want to leave chat,
but Albert isn't coughing up the info too fast.  And Jeff! Poor Jeff,
seeing me chatting with Albert -- another man! -- is apparently
undergoing some sort of mental event.  His messages pour in like mortar
fire.  They are capped finally with:

"Bitch! I asked you first!!!"

_Bitch?_ What the...?! I reach over and just shut the whole damn
modem/computer off.  Bye, boys.  Go play with someone else.

I flop back in my chair, exasperated.  Jesus.  I really felt like
breaking something.  Like Jeff's head maybe.  But there had been nothing
I could I do.  Except switch the machine off.

Makes you wonder what switches women use to get away from these kind of
guys in real life.  Hopefully it involves hollow-point bullets.

Subject: File 9--Updated Info on HOPE (FIrst US Hacker Congress) (REMINDER)

HACKERS ON PLANET EARTH

The First U.S. Hacker Congress

Yes, it's finally happening. A hacker party unlike anything ever seen
before in this country. Come help us celebrate ten years of existence
and meet some really interesting and unusual people in the process.
We've rented out the entire top floor of a midtown New York hotel,
consisting of several gigantic ballrooms. The conference will run
around the clock all weekend long.

SPEAKERS AND SEMINARS: Will there be famous people and celebrity
hackers? Of course, but the real stars of this convention will be
the hundreds of hackers and technologically inclined people journeying
from around the globe to share information and get new ideas.
That is the real reason to show up. Seminars include:
social engineering, cellular phone cloning, cable TV security,
stealth technology and surveillance, lockpicking, boxing of all sorts,
legal issues, credit cards, encryption, the history of 2600,
password sniffing, viruses, scanner tricks, and many more in the
planning stages. Meet people from the Chaos Computer Club, Hack-Tic,
Phrack, and all sorts of other k-rad groups.

THE NETWORK: Bring a computer with you and you can tie into the huge
Ethernet we'll be running around the clock. Show off your system and
explore someone else's (with their permission, of course). We will
have a reliable link to the Internet in addition. Finally, everyone
attending will get an account on our hope.net machine. We encourage
you to try and hack root. We will be giving away some valuable prizes
to the successful penetrators, including the keys to a 1994 Corvette.
(We have no idea where the car is, but the keys are a real
conversation piece.) Remember, this is only what is currently planned.
Every week, something new is being added so don't be surprised to find
even more hacker toys on display. We will have guarded storage areas
if you don't want to leave your equipment unattended.

VIDEOS: We will have a brand new film on hackers called
"Unauthorized Access", a documentary that tells the story from
our side and captures the hacker world from Hamburg to Los Angeles
and virtually everywhere in between. In addition, we'll have
numerous foreign and domestic hacker bits, documentaries,
news stories, amateur videos, and security propaganda. There
has been a lot of footage captured over the years - this will
be a great opportunity to see it all. We will also have one
hell of an audio collection, including prank calls that put
The Jerky Boys to shame, voice mail hacks, and even confessions
by federal informants! It's not too late to contribute material!

WHERE/WHEN: It all happens Saturday, August 13th and Sunday,
August 14th at the Hotel Pennsylvania in New York City
(Seventh Avenue, between 32nd and 33rd Streets, right across
the street from Penn Station). If you intend to be part of
the network, you can start setting up Friday night.
The conference officially begins at noon on Saturday and will
run well into Sunday night.

ACCOMMODATIONS: New York City has numerous cheap places to stay.
Check the update sites below for more details as they come in.
If you decide to stay in the hotel, there is a special discounted
rate if you mention the HOPE Conference. $99 is their base rate

Mini-suites are great for between six and ten people - total cost
for HOPE people is $160. If you work with others, you can easily

from overseas. Travel agencies will help you for free. Also look in
various magazines like Time Out, the Village Voice, local alternative

                              FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE


    PSI AND CANTER & SIEGEL NEGOTIATE AGREEMENT ON FUTURE INTERNET ACCESS

June 23, 1994 - Herndon, VA - Performance Systems International, Inc.
(PSI), of Herndon Virginia, which provides Internet connection services
to more people and organizations than all other providers, today disclosed
that an interim agreement had been reached with Canter & Siegel (C&S), of
Phoenix, Arizona regarding the controversial C&S advertising over the
Internet and USENET.

Both firms concur that the continuing orderly evolution of the commercial
Internet must be preserved, and to that end, Canter & Siegel and PSI have
agreed to the following:

a) C&S will refrain from mass electronic postings of any unsolicited,
   non-contextual, non-topic advertisements to the USENET discussion group
   bulletin board system;

b) C&S will refrain from mass postings of any unsolicited, non-contextual,
   non-topic advertisements using electronic mail or other TCP/IP Internet
   applications.

The worldwide Internet and USENET response to Canter & Siegel's activities
have been very strong. Many of the actions have been particularly virulent,
including the sending of "mail bombs". PSI has had first hand experience
where the actions in response to C&S were damaging to third parties. PSI
took a number of steps to remove these damaging situations as they occurred.
While the actions of C&S have been considered by many to be completely
inappropriate, the same is now being said about the actions in response to
C&S. Clearly, the ENTIRE situation needs to be amended and will take many
months, if not years, to settle out.

Better education will be key to Internet evolution with books like "NET
Etiquette" and the Internet Business Association (IBA) of Washington, DC
facilitating those changes. In addition, mediation and discussion instead
of unilateral confrontation, threats, and disconnection will be required
to develop the general framework for operating on the Internet as it continues
to evolve.  Several other application-oriented Internet service providers
have taken this approach successfully with C&S and others in parallel with PSI.

                                   ###

PSI's headquarters are located at 510 Huntmar Park Drive, Herndon, VA 22070.
Canter & Siegel is located at 3333 East Camelback Road, Suite 250,
Phoenix, AZ  85260.
