A few quick notes:

INFO ON BBS CRASHING WANTED:  We have had a few queries about the
prevalance, methods, and nature of ways to crash BBSs. We are looking
for information on ways this has been done (not a "how to"
description, but just a simple summary such as the Telegard bug that
contained the zipfile bug), on BBS software that have been
particularly prone to destructive invasion, or for other information
that we can use to put together an article on invasions that allow
penetration into they system itself.

+++++++++++++++++++++++++

COMPUSERVE CuDS MOVED:  The CUD issues on CompuServe have been
shuffled around a bit.  Recent issues can be found in DL0 of the
IBMBBS SIG and in DL1 of LAWSIG.  Back issues can be found in DL4 of
the IBMBBS SIG.  LAWSIG will one day have all the back issues as well,
when I or some other brave soul takes the time to upload them.
Cooperation between forums, to the extent of copying the files from
IBMBBS to LAWSIG, is apparently not possible.

LOSING YOUR ACCOUNT? Be sure to let us know if you do so we can unsub
you from the mailing list.

NEWSPAPER ARTICLES WANTED: Readers have been quite good about sending
along news articles from major outlets, but *please* also send along
stories from the local papers that you might come across, or let us
know the issue it's in and we'll try to dig up a copy.
