Subject: File 2--Response to "The Terminus of Len Rose"

In article <1991Jul19.033544.11623@chinacat.unicom.com> "Craig Neidorf"
<C483307@UMCVMB.BITNET> wrote one of the first articles I've read that
actually gave facts about what happened to Len Rose after he moved to
Illinois.  I appreciate that.  But then he wrote (about the law
enforcement folks who were involved):

This is sad.  During World War II, millions of innocent and
less-than-innocent people were put to death in concentration camps by
"decent folks" who "believe in their work like a sacred religious
mission", who "have families, hobbies, like to go to the movies, play
video games, take vacations during the holidays, and everything else."
They were just soldiers in a war, who did what they believed their
superiors expected of them, without questioning the morality of their
actions.  Some of them actually believed the pseudo-religious Nazi
doctrines that the jews were the cause of all their people's problems.

The lesson we and all the world's inhabitants should have learned from
WW2 is that each of us is responsible for the consequences of his
actions, and it is up to each of us to be sure that our actions are
moral and just.  None of us can hide his actions behind the excuse
that his superiors, or some recent and hastily-enacted law, justifies
an immoral act.

If the law enforcement community of the US has failed to learn this
lesson, then we are doomed to repeat an awful history.
