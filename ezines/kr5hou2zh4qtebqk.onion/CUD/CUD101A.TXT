COMPUTER UNDERGROUND DIGEST is an open forum dedicated to sharing
information among computerists and to the presentation and debate of
diverse views.
--------------------------------------------------------------------
DISCLAIMER: The views represented herein do not necessarily represent the
            views of the moderators. Contributors assume all responsibility
            for assuring that articles submitted do not violate copyright
            protections.
--------------------------------------------------------------------
This is a short issue to double check the address list. Some addresses
returned the first issue of 1,200 lines because of length.  If you receive
this, but did not receive the first issue, let us know and we will re-send
it.  If length is a problem, let us know. We will try to keep the file
length to about 1,000 lines, but we have been informed that some notes
reject anything over 450-500.  As a rule of thumb, every 100 lines
constitutes about 6 K, so if you are restricted by file size, send along
your limits.

We also remind people that in the "TK0" response, that's a ZERO,
not an "OH"!

If people send enough material, we will try to put out an issue every few
weeks.  For space purposes, we will ask that signatures be kept brief and
that that formatting be at least 65 characters per line.

The feedback on the first issue was generally positive. We would like to
hear from readers regarding the types of articles you would like to see.
Content will be determined primarily by the contributions, and we
especially encourage public domain news articles. We caution all
contributors to assure no copyright violations occur. We have already been
involved in a minor squabble with the AUSTIN-AMERICAN STATESMAN (see file
3, this issue).

In a recent mail test, we accidentally send out a preliminary mailing list
due to a glitch in our auto-mailing file. This has been corrected. We
consider the names and addresses on this list strictly confidential, and
although the digest is open to all receivers and contributors, the mailing
list is NOT!  Mark Seiden (among others) quickly responded. We reprint his
thoughtful observations in File 1, and accept his invitation to respond in
File 2.

There have been requests for back issues of various magazines and
journals of the computer underground. We believe that many of these
provide a historical archive for those who desire to chronicle the
growth and maturity of various groups, or who are interested in
these files for social science research as documents of a particular
societal subculture. A number of people have suggested that we
serve as a clearing house for such documents. Because there has
been no indication that any of the documents are illegal, and
because law enforcement agencies have not objected on LEGAL GROUNDS
to any of these documents publicly or--to our knowledge--privately,
we assume they are acceptable for distribution.
Currently available are:

PHRACK  (issues 1-30)
LoD/H (issues 1-4)
      We are missing files 10-14 of LoD/H issue #1. Perhaps
      somebody could pass them along.
P/Hun (issues 1-3)
PIRATE Magazine (issues 1-5)
ATI (issues 1-44; we are missing issues #4 and #10. Could somebody
     send these over?)
And other lesser digests and journals. We will also maintain
back issues of CuD.

We stress that possession and/or distribution of these documents
*IN NO WAY* constitutes support or encouragement of any activities
describes therein. However, we strongly believe that they should
be available for those interested in fully understanding the
computer underground subculture.

Greetings, 'ackologists and -osophists...

You may have noticed that in the process of setting up the BITNET mailing
list for CuD [Computer Underground Digest] our Lord of Hosts [Jim Thomas]
somehow managed to send out to everybody a test transmission containing the
email address of *everybody* on the mailing list.

This set off my "right to privacy/paranoia" detector, prompting a note to
him saying "Isn't it nice now that you've told the FBI who we all are"
whereupon he revealed that, indeed, the list contains "everything from law
enforcement on one end to at least one LoD [Legion of Doom] member on the
other."  What a pleasant rainbow effect that conjured up...

Consider the DEA officials who have (reportedly) been convincing
advertisers selling Gro-lites in (among other publications) "High Times" to
turn over their customer lists. Legend has it that the Orchid Societies are
up in arms over flak-jacketed drug agents with zero-tolerance for indoor
plant-growing knocking at their member's doors, and to date discovering
only orchids...  (I expect to read about it in the Wall Street Journal
gardening column any day now.)

I wonder whether overzealous g-men and women might be interested in just
who cares about the computer underground, suspecting that perhaps they
might have some personal involvement?  Perhaps some of us are now or were
once in possession of forbidden knowledge valued by beancounters in excess
of $5000?  Hmmm, that backup tape from that job ten years ago containing,
jeez, i forget, secrets of incalculable worth (in one case, people with
questionable smarts took hundreds of man-years [yes, they were all men] and
still didn't get it right...), and that version of troff source I always
wanted to fix...  Ohmigod, I was on the PHRACK mailing list, and now I'm on
this one too, and I've been to some of the Hackers' Conferences!  Now I
realize this was one of those elaborate sting operations I keep reading
about, and I got sucked in right away, naive little me...

I'm expecting the Secret Service to show up at my door any day now.  I
would burn those backup tapes, but that's probably a violation of US Title
18, section whatever, "thinking about intending to try to conceal evidence
of a possible future crime" (and I'm even more afraid of a disk crash).
(Note for the Tomorrow File: A new source of revenue for lawyers: store
your hacker-client's backup tapes, which would then be protected as
privileged communication?)

Thanks a lot, Jim.  You're welcome to ask the natural/more serious
follow-on questions...
