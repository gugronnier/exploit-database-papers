ATI is going on its third year as your first source of underground news.

ATI is Activist Times Inc., an underground online newsletter with a
mission: to present information and opinion in a socially relevant and
stimulating context.  ATI features articles about and for the computer
underground, telecom, BBSing, anarchy, current events, social issues, humor ,
entertainment and more.  ATI is into Politics, the environment, technology,
the telephone, and mostly the First Amendment.

Prime Anarchist is the originator of ATI and its co-editor along with
Ground Zero, who is also its publisher.  Prime began ATI around February,
1988 as an online newsletter on bulletin boards in Rhode Island and New
York, in addition to producing a few issues on hard copy.  Soon ATI spread
to the downloading sections of bulletin boards across the country, most
notably The Phoenix Project and P-80 Systems.

ATI has a long list of present and past contributors, and has been known
to present articles that conveyed a unique twist of humor. The titles speak
for themselves: "Terrorism of a 976 Phone Sex Line", "Quantum Mix-Up", "Mall
Terrorism", "Fun in Rich Rural Towns", and many others.

In fact, some of the originators of YIPL/TAP magazine ghostwrote some
articles in 88 and 89. Some of the ghosts' initials (for you yipsters) were
RF, norfolk Virginia; CC, NYC; AH, Penn; FS, NYC; FS, Rhode Island; & A1,
NYC.

Issues of ATI may be obtained from many bulletin boards in the US, Europe
and around the world, including Ripco BBS at 312-528-5020.  You may also be
added to ATI's net distribution list by e-mailing Ground Zero at:
> uunet!tronsbox!akcs.groundzero or akcs.groundzero@tronsbox.xei.com if you <
have a smart mailer.

To receive back issues of ATI, email Ground Zero or access the ftp
distribution site at 128.95.136.2 and enter 'cd tmp/ftp/ATI'. Details are
available in ATI #49 on how to receive back issues on disk.

So demand ATI on your nearest BBS, inside your favorite mainframe, or right
to your modem. But whatever you do, demand it. =)

The makers of ATI would like to thank: Brother Jack, Dr. Timothy Leary,
Jello Biafra, Johanna Lawrenson, Spin Magazine, Spy Magazine, Ronald and
Nancy Reagan, Dirk Hitler, Manuel Noriega, Saddam "sodom" Hussein, The 1910
FruitGum Company, Samuel Clemens, Jim and Tammy Baker, Oliver North,
Ferdinand and Imelda and her shoes, and all the little people Leona
Helmsley talked about.

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

{Moderators' comment: ATI is a nice antidote to those who see no political
consciousness amongst the CU. Like most e-mail mags, the substance has slowly
changed and matured over the years, and it is becoming a nice mix of
political, technical, and other information of relevance to computerists.
Thanks to Ground Zero and Prime Anarchist for putting out a nifty publication.
