On December 3rd, 1990 a group called RABID National Development Corp.
released hacked version of Chuck Foresburg's DSZ Z-Modem Protocol dated
12-03-90.  This is really the 11-19-90 version with the dates edited and a
virus added to the program.  *** THIS VIRUS IS DESTRUCTIVE!!! ***

I obtained the virused version early this week and worked quickly to
provide this program to you.  The information I provide here may not be all
there is t know about the virus, but it is sufficient to determine that the
virus is not what you want to have.

RABID Virus Information

Preliminary testing has revealed these facts about the virus:

        * The virus is not memory resident.

        * The virus infects .COM files only, including COMMAND.COM.
          (There was one report that it infected and .EXE file and
           several text files but this could not be confirmed or
           duplicated.)

        * Infected files increase in size by 5,302 bytes.

        * The virus infects other .COM files at execution time.

        * The virus will activate on 12-25-90 (Christmas) or any date
          thereafter.

        * When activated the boot sector, FATs and root directory will
          be overwritten with garbage.  Recovery is impossible unless
          you use a program such as PcTools Mirror to make backup copies
          of the system areas.


As far as programming goes the virus is poorly written, but it does
accomplish what it was designed to do.  The actual virus code is about
1,300 bytes with a 4,000 byte ansi screen that is supposed to be displayed
upon activation.  I sa "supposed to" because on every test I performed the
screen displayed as a bunc of video garbage.  This occurs when loading the
screen data starting at the wrong location.

The virus has been passed along to John McAfee and he will have a fix in
his next release.  However, this release is not due until February and that
is too late for those infected already.  The information has also been
passed along t Chuck Foresburg and he is aware of the situation.

VirusFix Instructions

The operation of VirusFix is simple.

To scan entire disk(s), just specify the disk(s) you wish to scan.
Examples:
           VIRUSFIX C:
           VIRUSFIX C: D:
           VIRUSFIX A:

To scan a single directory, specify the directory to scan.
Examples:

VirusFix will notify you if the RABID virus is found and ask if you wish to remove the virus.  Every file that I infected and removed
the virus from has worked properly so VirusFix should work with most files.  If you remove a viru from a file and it doesn't work,
delete the file and replace it with and uninfected copy.  If you suspect a file other that .COM files is infected, use text search
program and search for the string "RABID" in the suspect file.
