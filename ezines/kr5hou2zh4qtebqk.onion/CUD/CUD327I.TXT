Subject: File 9--Chaos Computer Club archives at titania.mathematik.uni-ulm.de

The archives of the Chaos Computer Club are at
	titania.mathematik.uni-ulm.de:info/CCC/

Here's a rough translation into English of their READ_ME file.

- translation of titania.mathematik.uni-ulm.de:info/CCC/LIES_MICH

If almost all of the texts in the CCC Archive are in German, shouldn't
the READ_ME file be called LIES_MICH, eh?  :-)

Here follows our electronic CCC Archive; everything about the CCC that
flies around on the networks should land here.  Should.  Anyone who
has anything else, texts or questions, or... ==> mail to ccc-ulm@rz.uni-ulm.de

For reasons of space most everything is in UNIX compress format.  You
must transfer them in binary mode!

To transport them to VMS you must rename the files, since VMS has room
for only one "." in the filename and the VMS compress uses the suffix
_Z.

==>	ftp> binary
	ftp> get "blubber.blaeh.Z" blubber.bleah_z

(should work with most VMS ftps, or try it without the "")

If you want to transfer the files through a gateway, like e.g. BITFTP,
then they need to be uuencoded, otherwise you get data salad
[Datensalat].  See bitftp.txt.

First uudecode, then decompress, and the text files will be readable.

For VMS, Atari-ST, MS-DOOF uhh.. MS-DOS and Amiga there are files in
the directories under soft/tools to for unpacking.  If you have
compress and uudecode for other operating systems, please send me the
programs.
