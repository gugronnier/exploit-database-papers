COMPUTERS UNDER ATTACK
Intruders, Worms, and Viruses
Edited by Peter J. Denning
ACM Press and Addison-Wesley, 1990, 554pp
$18.50 ACM members, $20.50 others

On behalf of ACM Press and the authors of the 38 articles brought together
in this edition, I am proud to announce that our book on the subject of
attacks on computers is now available.

This subject continues to receive ongoing attention in the national press
--for example, the recent discovery of $12M of toll fraud at the NASA
Johnson Space Center, Operation Sun Devil, an Esquire article about
computer pirates breaking in to the Bell System, and the recent splashy
appearance of the NRC report, "Computers at Risk".

The purpose of this book is to tell the story of attacks on computers in
the words of those who are making the story and who see the broad
perspective in which it is taking place.  We have painstakingly selected
the articles and have provided connective material to bring out the global
context and show that the problem is not purely technology, not purely
people, but a product of the interaction between people and computers in a
growing worldwide network.

After and introduction and preface by me, the articles are arranged in six
parts.  Most of these have been previously published, but there are a few
new pieces specifically commissioned for this volume.

PART I: THE WORLDWIDE NETWORK OF COMPUTERS

Worldnet and ARPANET by Denning, overview of networks by Quarterman,
reflections by Thompson, survey of computer insecurities by Witten.

PART II: INTRUDERS

Reflections by Reid, Wily hacker story by Stoll, a followup commentary by
Mandel, and a business perspective by Wilkes.

PART III: WORMS

Internet worm overview by Denning, perspectives on the Morris worm by MIT's
Rochlis et al, Purdue's Spafford, and Utah's Seeley, executive summary of
Cornell Report, Morris indictment and trial summary by Montz, original worm
paper by Shoch and Hupp.

PART IV: VIRUSES

Virus overview by Denning, BRAIN and other virus operation by Highland,
virus primer by Spafford et al, viral protection in MS/DOS by Brothers, and
a perspective on viruses by Cohen.

PART V:  COUNTERCULTURES

Computer property rights by Stallman, cyberspace literature by Paul Saffo,
a dialog on hacking and security by Dorothy Denning and Frank Drake.

PART VI:  SOCIAL, LEGAL, AND ETHICAL IMPLICATIONS

A spectrum of commentaries: moral clarity and sending a signal by Denning,
global city by Morris, virus bills in congress by Crawford, GAO report
summary, legal issues by Samuelson and by Gemingani, computer emergency
response by Scherlis et al, ethics statements by various organizations, ACM
