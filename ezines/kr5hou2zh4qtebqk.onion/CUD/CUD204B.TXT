We received the following from one of the more interesting newsnets
around, and the author gave permission to reprint it.

I have always been amused at reading how the goons confiscate printers when
they move in.  How silly!  Yet it got me thinking...

If I were a computer criminal, I might just create a very special printer with
a bank of non-volatile storage in it.  Or, for that matter, just buy one of
the modern printers you can get these days with 4 megs ram, etc.

I would use that storage, normally, to keep all the stolen access codes,
calling card numbers, and other incriminating data.   Pretty easy, with the
high speed link I have to my printer, to fetch the codes from it.

(I would also have the machine erase stuff if disconnected improperly, keeping
backups somewhere far away.)

Or I could hide this info in little hidden places in all kinds of semi-smart
or smart peripherals -- including some off the shelf.

So if we fight (correctly) to stop them from confiscating everything, this may
drive the real criminals to such tricks, which may lead to grander
confiscation.  I point this out -- I don't know if there's an answer.
