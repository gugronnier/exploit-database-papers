{The moderators deleted the identity of the following article's author because
of legitimate concerns for his welfare. He is considered by those familiar
with his situation to be another victim of recent SS activity, and the need
to conceal his identity further illustrates the chilling effect on freedom
of speech that the SS has created--moderators.}
 
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
 
I just remembered a Texas tie-in to the LOD name.  I found this in Mike
Cochran's book "And deliver us from evil," from Texas Monthly Press.  In
the concluding essay, he wrote,
 
	And, if there was a roll call for bizarre Texas crime, it surely
	would include:
 
[ (accounts of mayhem removed)
 
	-- The Legion of Doom, an up-scale group of student vigilantes who
	used dead cats, car bombs, and other forms of intimidation to shape
	up the riffraff at Fort Worth's Paschal High.  Their misguided crusade
	got them in a heap of trouble, but they all escaped jail.
 
Speaking of reading... I re-read CUD 1.18 today.  There are parts of John R.
Simpson's response to Representative Don Edwards' FOI inquiry that, ahem, do
not compute.  Like this:
 
	"We do not keep records of the bulletin boards which we have
	monitored but we can provide information concerning a particular
	board if we are given the name of the board."
 
Well, maybe they'd go check the board out again.  But, as "records of the
bulletin boards which we have monitored" may include communications program
dialing directories and call logs, as well as telephone records of outgoing
calls, I know that what Simpson has said isn't true.  Let's see what's on
those disks and phone bills, Uncle Sam!
 
But the real corker is:
 
	"No, the U.S. Secret Service has not created a computer bulletin
	board nor a network which was offered to members of the public.  We
	have created an undercover bulletin board which was offered to a select
	number of individuals who had demonstrated an interest in conducting
	criminal activities.  This was done with the guidance of the U.S.
	Attorney's Office and was consistent with the Electronic Communications
	Privacy Act."
 
When I was interviewed by the Secret Service in early 1990, SS Agent Timothy
Foley discussed the UNIX system known as "attctc", formerly called "killer."
Agent Foley discussed the status of jolnet and attctc, claiming that "I own
jolnet" and "I own attctc."  He also asked me why I thought AT&T would fund
attctc.  His answer to his own question was that attctc existed "for the
"for the purpose of monitoring the hacker community."  When it was still
running,  attctc was once referred to as "the largest mail hub in the
Southwest."  Did AT&T provide Secret Service agents with access to attctc?  I
had this view of attctc as a kink in the image of AT&T as an all-devouring
monopoly, and approved of it as good for the image of AT&T.  But if it was a
listening post, well, I take it all back.  It was >very< available to the
public.
What role did Uncle Sam and the Secret Service have in the management, funding
and operation of attctc?
