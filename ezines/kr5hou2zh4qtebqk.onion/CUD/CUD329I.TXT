Subject: CFV:  comp.patents, misc.legal.computing and misc.int-property

For those of who don't read news.announce.newgroups, here's a set of
proposal for some new newsgroups.  Voting continues to the end of the
month.

A group for the discussion of issues related to patents and their
relationship to computer technology (hardware and software); Peter
Treloar, University of Sydney, is moderator.

A group for the discussion of the legal aspects of computers, or
places where computers or computer users bump into the law.  This
charter is very broad, and the group is unmoderated.

A group for the discussion of intellectual property rights, that is to
say the field clustering around the notions of patents, copyrights,
trade secrets, or other rights and benefits retained by the original
producer of a creative work.  The group is unmoderated.

To vote you may reply to this message.  Using this suggested text will
let the votes be counted quickly and painlessly.

	To: patents-vote@msen.com
	Subject: vote

	vote yes/no/abstain comp.patents
	vote yes/no/abstain misc.legal.computing
	vote yes/no/abstain misc.int-property
	quit

Vote early and often!  (But be sure to vote either yes, or no, or
abstain;
votes for "yes/no/abstain" will be sent back...)  Early returns have been
generally positive.
