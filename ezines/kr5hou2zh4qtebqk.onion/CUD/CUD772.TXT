As computers are utilized in more and more aspects of everyday life,
the once distinct areas of technology, legislature, and law
enforcement draw closer together.  This unique technical conference
provides a forum in which members of these three fields can meet to
share experiences and ideas.  The four day technical program (a day of
tutorials, two days of talks, and another day of tutorials) will
provide you with essential knowledge, whether your field is technical,
legal, or law enforcement.

S1 - 9:00am-5:00pm
Basics of Unix Security
Peter Galvin, Corporate Technologies, Inc.

This course will teach you the very basics about Unix security,
including some common threats, what to monitor in the file system,
standard publicly-available tools and resources, and some common
programmed threats to Unix including how to deal with
denial-of-service attacks.

The emphasis of this class is on security basics -- the very
fundamentals to making a Unix system more secure.  Thus, this course
is targetted at new Unix administrators and auditors, and those who
have not had as much background and experience with security as they
might need.  The material is presented in a vendor-independent
fashion, and presupposes no prior knowledge of (or access to) source
code.  Students will receive a copy of "Practical Unix Security" by
Simson Garfinkel and Gene Spafford, which will be used as the textbook
for the course.

W3a - 9:00pm- 12:30pm           
Network Intrusions
John Smith, Computer Crime Unit, Santa Clara County District
        Attorney's Office

An intruder has gained access to your computer system.  How do you
explain what was stolen and how to a police detective who thinks
you're speaking a foreign language?  How can you, the system
administrator, help the detectives write the report or explain to them
that they might have to do the examination of any recovered evidence
such as a copied account?

Actual cases of computer crimes in Silicon Valley are used as
examples.  Students will follow what has to be done in an
investigation, step by step, including the initial reports that would
be the basis of any search warrants or restraining orders.  Students
will learn how to speed up an investigation by learning to prepare
reports and diagrams that can be part of a request for a search
warrant.

The Santa Clara County District Attorney's Officer Hi Tech/Computer
Crime Team has had years of experience investigating and prosecuting
trade secret thefts, network intrusions, chip thefts, and other types
of high tech thefts in Silicon Valley.  This experience is interesting
and can serve as a means of educating computer administrators how to
protect their computers and systems, how to prepare an investigation,
how to get the appropriate law enforcement support, and how to prepare
to testify in court if necessary.

Topics covered include:

COMMON INTRUSION METHODS:

* POOR PASSWORDS: don't set youself up to be cracked!
* CRACKER PROGRAMS: the most vicious ones in the cracker toolkit
        - TFTP and TCP/IP
        - Trojan Horses
        - Backdoor Programs
        - TIGER and other tools
* SOCIAL ENGINEERING: People can be cracked too, you know.
* PHYSICAL SECURITY: do you know who your modem is talking to?
* GUEST OR ANONYMOUS ACCOUNTS: sure you'll let your sister date him,
but would you give him an account on your machine?

COMMON ERRORS:

* BUGS and common Security holes
* IP ADDRESSING: what all those numbers & names mean
* MISCONFIGURED SYSTEMS: Some inital configurations come with holes
that vendors expect system admins to fix.
* TRUSTED HOST: don't leave your system wide open

PLUS...

T3b - 1:30pm-5:00pm
Ethics and Systems Administration
S.Lee Henry, Johns Hopkins University

Sysadmins find themselves increasingly involved in ethical dilemmas
that pit security against privacy, and threaten to disrupt the
delicate balance between personal and commercial interests.

When, if ever, should you overlook the personal use of business
computers?  How should you handle matters involving the potentially
illegal use of your systems?  How do you protect your users' privacy
while not making yourself liable for their activities?  Can you
effectively curb the spread of pirated software?  What are the safest
and most defensible policies to adhere to in light of current laws and
legal precedents?  Can you enforce policies that guard against abuse
while not handcuffing the people whose commitment and creativity your
organization most needs?  What should you do if the abuser is your
boss?

This highly interactive, fast-paced tutorial will challenge sysadmins
to come to grips with some difficult ethical dilemmas.

ABOUT THE INSTRUCTOR: S. Lee Henry is a columnist for SunExpert
magazine and has been managing Sun net works for about ten years.  She

KEYNOTE SPEAKERS:
-----------------

The Sun User Group keynote sessions are topical and informative --
speakers you won't hear at any other conference!

        Ken Geide, Chief, FBI Economic Espionage Unit
        "Economic Espionage in the USA"
        Monday, November 13, 9 a.m. - 10:30 a.m.


TECHNICAL SESSIONS (Monday, November 13 & Tuesday, November 14):
-------------------------------------------------------------------

"Computers & The Law" features three distinct parallel tracks of talks:
Technical; Legal; and Law Enforcement.

        The TECHNICAL track will focus on nuts and bolts of
        maintaining a UNIX or Sun system.  These talks will cover the
        all of the newest developments in the changing world
        of technology.  There are talks from the experts on: UNIX and
        network security; encryption; software distribution in a
        client/server environment; firewalls.

        The LEGAL track will cover up-to-date issues of privacy and
        morality, as well as in-depth examinations of the current and
        changing laws pertaining to software and hardware.  Legal
        professionals from all over the country will examine how
        changing technologies will necessitate changes in the law.

        The LAW ENFORCEMENT track discusses computers as tools.  Tools
        which can help in the prevention of crimes -- or in the
        commission of them.  Join or experts in high-tech crime as the
        discuss the discovery, investigation, apprehension, and
        prosecution of crackers, software pirates, and bandits on the
        information on the information superhighway.

SPECIAL FEATURES:

"The Future of Computer Crime"

        Join our panel of experts from both sides of the law discuss
        and predict the uses and abuses of computers into the next
        century.

"Unix Security Tools Workshop"
Peter Galvin, Corporate Technologies, Inc.

        With so many tools available to help detect and prevent
        security problems, you practically need a guide to what's
        available, where to get it, what it does, and why you'd want
        to use it.  This workshop is that guide. We'll look at
        scanning tools, detection tools, prevention tools, firewall
        tools, and tools to help during the course of a break-in. Note
        that this is a workshop, not just a talk: If you have favorite
        tools, please be ready to talk about them!

The Great Debate: Round 2
"Can Existing Laws Be Applied To Cyberspace?"

        "Cyberspace is the new frontier, and is like nothing we've
        seen or experiened before.  In order to keep order in this new
        wilderness, we need new legislation.  Current laws, fine for
        lower technologies, can't possible keep up with the rapidly
        changing face of cyberspace."

                               -- OR --

        "Cyberspace isn't "space" at all.  It's not a place, it's a
        tool, like a FAX machine or a telephone.  We don't need
        special 'electronic' laws, because all of the issues that come
        up on The Internet have all come up before."

        Which is it?  Come hear constitutional law expert Michael
        Froomkin (University of Miami Law School) and former New
        Jersey Securities commissioner Jared Silverman (Hannoch
        Weisman) in the debate which will could change the shape of
        Cyberspace - or your view of it.

From: Dick Mills <dmills@albany.net>
Subject: File 2--Policial potency of the net

andrewm@interport.net(Andrew Mark) wrote an excellent article [CUD #7.69]
on "File 4 - Heroes and Villains."  It provided a splash of cold reality
of the kind we don't hear often on the net.

Good work Mark.  Your article amply illustrates that democratic doesn't
mean effective.  In real life, endless rants, raves, and flames are
likely to have the opposite effect intended. You're right; but I think
your implied admonishment to Netters to BE RESPONSIBLE, are as
ineffective as that you decry.  Here's why.

What do you expect?  The net is anarchistic. Anarchists have the same
fundamental problem taking control of politics as celibates do in taking
over the gene pool.

Why admonish us to get our act together?  What can we do within the
constraints of the medium as it works today?  Everyone says
his own thing.  You did it and now I'm doing it.  There is no leader,
and no copy editor. True, there are newsletters like CUD, but there is
no effective way to edit or filter the general babble.

An alternative medium that recently achieved politically potency
is talk radio.  I think the reason why it succeeded is clear. Rush.
Rush provides a focal point and leadership for like minded people to
rally behind.  This gives their views coherency and thus potency.  I
suppose, the combination of the Christian Right and Christian TV is an
analogous success story.

        ALTERNATIVE MEDIUM + A FOCAL POINT = NEWFOUND POTENCY.

*Will* the net ever find its focal point?  Who knows?  It would be nice,
but there is no guarantee that it will ever happen.

*Should* the net find its focal point?  There I have two opinions.

1) The net has potential for improving our democracy quite a bit.  The
   improvement would come from breaking the monopoly of mainstream media
   and their control of the flow of information.

2) As an old fart, I'm attracted to the net precisely because it gives
   me the opportunity to act juvenilely and irresponsibly.  That
   includes political irresponsibility, i.e. flaming.  It's a
   great release from the pressures of real life.  If it weren't for my
   gray hair and wrinkles, I'd do it at the bar scene. Behind the
   anonymity of my modem, nobody knows who I *really* am.

   I sincerely hope that if and when the net finds itself, that we will
   leave a corner remaining for juvenile wannabes.

;)

No. On second thought, :|
