***  CuD #3.06, File 1 of 6: Moderator's corner                  ***
********************************************************************

From: Moderators
Subject: Moderators' Corner
Date: February 23, 1991

A few comments in list format:

1) The Len Rose case is still pending. It is currently on a day-by-day
status as discussions occur. More on this later.

2) The concern about privacy and First Amendment issues in cyberspace
continues. We are re-printing Brock Meeks' original "FBI" article (see file
5 below) because it has aroused renewed interest. Brock also wrote a recent
story on the FBI running "sting"-type operations which we encourage all to
read. The concern impels us to do a special issue on it all within the next
few weeks.

3) For the next month or so, CuD will be coming out about bi-weekly because
of time constraints. Gordon has been transferred to Pennsylvania, but will
be commuting between the east and west coasts every two weeks as part of
his employment. Jim's publishers have lost all sense of humor and are
demanding the two promised books, long past deadline.
