FACE-TO-FACE BBS
++++++++++++

A number of electronic digests exist, such as this one, that attempt to
raise the issues of computer security, ethics, law, or policy. Few BBSs
exist for the same purpose. However, a new BBS has been set up for the
discussion of hacking, and unlike conventional "hacker" BBSs, this one is
designed for discussions between law enforcement and security specialists
and hackers.  The goal of the board is to provide serious, intelligent
dialogue between various groups. It's called FACE-TO-FACE, and the number is
713-242-6853.

Here is the introductory log-in message:

                 All Hackers, Federal Agents, and Journalists

           Welcome to a new concept in underground bulletin boards!

IDEA:  The idea first came to me when I was mourning over the fact that Phoenix
Project went down.  I thought, now gee, that was a good board.  Ever since then
I've been searching for a place to "Hang-out"; A place where users were not
only productive but mature.  Well, out of all those BBS's out there, I could
not locate one that met my standards of "a good board".  So, I came to the
conclusion:  There are no decent BBS's in the underground still running.  Then
it hit me-- Why not make one ?  Sounds logical.  Well, here it is.

FACE to FACE:  This BBS is devoted to having an intelligent, mature,
communication link from the Computer Underground to the Press and back to the
Security Agencies around the nation.

WARNING:  Although this BBS allows "hackers" access, The Management of this
BBS demands that all users refrain from posting illegal material in nature.
If any such material is posted, that user and the message(s) shall be deleted.
I can't stress this enough.  You have called a BBS where security agents are
scanning the messages also-- It's for OUR and YOUR saftey.  We do not advocate
"hacking" in any way.

We are the MODERATORS of this BBS, while you are the USERS.  It's a pure
communications link between the two sides.  One side seeing white, the other
black.  We see grey.

Access is guaranteed to any user who wishes to call.

This is an open system for the "phree" world.

                         (End Face-2-Face header)
