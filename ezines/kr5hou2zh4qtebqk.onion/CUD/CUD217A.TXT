Len Rose Update
+++++++++++++++++++++

Len Rose will go to trial in Baltimore in late January barring any
extensions. He asked us to pass on his thanks to the many, many people who
responded to his request for witnesses.  Len is still unemployed and is
prevented from seeking menial work because his leg remains in a cast and he
cannot stand for extended periods of time. He sends his thanks to those who
have helped in financially and emotionally during this period.  Those
wishing to help him through the holidays are encouraged to send donations
to:


       Len Rose Donation
       c/o Sheldon Zenner
       Katten, Muchin and Zavis
       525 W. Monroe, Suite 1600
       Chicago,  IL  60606

Checks should be made out to either Sheldon Zenner or Len Rose.

FTP Files
+++++++++++++++

A few more state statutes have been added to the ftp site along with a few
legal papers. The complete NIA (Network Information Access, #s 1-67) will
also be up by Christmas. DAVE BANISAR has been helpful in expanding the
legal documents.

The EFF NEWSLETTER, which just came out, will also be added.  We encourage
people to ftp it and upload it elsewhere. Their first issue is excellent
(we reprint their response to the Riggs sentencing memo in file 3).
