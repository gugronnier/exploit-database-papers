Subject: File 2--Clarification of "Boycott" Comment

In my review of _Cyberpunk_ (CuD 3.32), I quoted a passage that
referred to a "national computer security expert's" call for a boycott
of any company that hired Robert Morris. In context, the passage would
appear to be less than charitable.  Gene Spafford, the person
associated with the boycott call, never made this claim, and he has
tried without success to clarify what was actually said.  He was
misquoted in a speech, and the misquote has become a reality of its
own.  Although it seems like a relatively minor point, the continued
circulation of the quotation error perpetuates an unjustified aura of
extra-legal professional retaliation.  Sometimes the slightest
transposition of words leads to quite different meanings, and it
appears that Gene is the victim of a shift of phrases that distorted
his message.  We discussed this with him, and the following scenario
seems to be the source of the error. We have included a response he
wrote to the CACM to correct the error, but it was also garbled by the
editor to whom it was sent.

In March 1990 at the DPMA Computer Virus & Security Conference in NYC,
Gene gave the keynote address.  He discussed community ethics
and made a statement like "We should boycott any company that hires
someone like Morris *because of* what he did."  This was heard by at
least one person present as meaning, "Because of what he did, we
should boycott any company that hires Morris."  What he meant, and
what he thought was clear from context, was "We should boycott any
company that believes what Morris did was a reason to hire him."

The quote was reported in CACM and Spaf wrote a letter (published in
the October 1990 issue) pointing out the error, but they misunderstood
the way it was supposed to have text boldfaced to indicate the emphasis.
The point did not get across clearly and was also incorrectly
paraphrased in Peter Denning's editorial in the August 1990 CACM.

Enclosed is the text of the letter he sent to CACM and which was
published in the September 1990 issue without the indicated emphasis:

     [ The following uses TeX conventions:  {\it text} is italics, and
     {\bf text} is boldface.]

     To the editor:

     The May issue of {\it Communications} contained a ``News Track''
     account of some of my remarks on hiring known hackers/crackers.
     I believe the report was derived from my keynote presentation at
     the 3rd DPMA Virus Workshop, held March 14 in New York.
     Unfortunately, the item in question did not report the full
     context of my remarks, and thus the actual intent was obscured.

     It is my contention that we should not do business with companies
     that hire known computer miscreants {\bf because of their
     criminal escapades}.  There are two reasons for this, one
     grounded in good business sense, and the other grounded in
     professional ethics.

     From a business standpoint, hiring a known computer criminal
     because of his criminal past is likely to be a liabilty.  The
     individual has already shown that he (or she) has not felt
     constrained to respect legal and ethical boundaries, or that he
     has exhibited poor judgment in not thinking about adverse
     consequences.  What indication is there that such behavior will
     not be repeated?  Furthermore, there is no indication that
     someone who breaks into a system knows how to protect the system
     or make it better -- he has only shown that he knows how to break
     in.  This is the origin of my ``arsonist'' statement, quoted in
     the article.  As a customer of such a firm, it is possible I
     would never be as confident about the integrity of its products
     as if the hacker had not been hired.

     From a professional standpoint, I view the hiring of computer
     criminals {\bf because of their notoriety or criminal success} to
     be insulting and unconscionable.  Consider that there are many
     tens of thousands of people who have worked for years to become
     knowledgeable and responsible members of the profession, and many
     thousands more currently studying the discipline.  What will it
     mean to them if a criminal is hired to a position of
     responsibility because of a violation of professional standards?
     Should the rest of us seek distinguished appointments by
     spectacular violations of the law?  What would it say to all of
     us that a business would value unethical behavior above a record
     of accomplishment and professionalism?  To ignore or accept such
     behavior is to allow our profession to be besmirched.  I view it
     as an insult, and to acquiesce quietly would appear to be a
     violation of our Code of Professional Conduct.

     Note that I am {\bf not} in any way suggesting that we act to
     prevent these individuals from being employed in a
     computing-related profession.  If the individual involved has the
     necessary training and background, and is as qualified as other
     applicants, then he should be treated as any other individual
     applying for a position.  This is especially true once an
     individual has served a sentence for their [sic] crimes.  Robert
     T. Morris, for instance, has demonstrated a keen interest and
     more than moderate facility with computers.  To protest his
     taking a computing-related job would be to unfairly embellish the
     sentence already imposed by the federal court.  We should not
     seek to second-guess our legal system, nor extract revenge above
     and beyond the punishment already meted out.  To do so would be
     petty and mean-spirited.

     In summary, my remarks at the Virus Workshop argued that we
     should protest if businesses reward these offenders for their
     actions; I did not mean to suggest that we forbid these
     individuals from ever working in computing-related jobs.  I also
     did not suggest that we devise any additional punishment for Mr.
     Morris.  He has been sentenced for his crime, and it is not for
     us to seek to augment his punishment.  It is time for all of us
     to move on and put that whole incident behind us.
