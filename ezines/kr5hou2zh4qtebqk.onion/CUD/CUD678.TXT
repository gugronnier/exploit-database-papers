 Interattiva (Association for Freedom in Electronic Interactive
 Communications)

ALCEI - Electronic Frontiers Italy is an association of people
dedicated to affirm and protect constitutional rights for "electronic
citizens" as new communications technologies emerge.

ALCEI is focused on the safeguard of freedom of expression and
personal privacy for any person using electronic communication
systems for personal, social, cultural, professional activities.

ALCEI was founded in Milan at the end of July 1994 and is inspired by
the principles and goals of the Electronic Frontier Foundation.

The main objectives of ALCEI - EF Italy are:

- To ensure the protection of Constitutional rights for citizens using
computer-based communication systems, researching and advising on
current and future laws to ensure those rights;

- To monitor, disclose and oppose any behavior intended to put
restriction, censorship or suppression of free circulation of
electronic communications and exchange of information and ideas, no
matter how controversial.

- To support, encourage and promote the development and use of
electronic communications, in order to enable all citizens to have a
voice in the information age.

- To inform and educate the community at large about computer-based
communication systems, emphasizing their responsible use and their
positive consequences for our society.

The activities of ALCEI - EF Italy include:

- Organization of electronic mailing lists and public online
conferences distributed throughout Italian systems for discussion on
the above mentioned topics and related activities.

- Research of current Italian and International laws regarding
bulletin board systems and other online information services to set
up guide-lines for providers of the these services, detailing their
rights and responsibilities.

Subject: File 2--Good, bad, etc. (Response by Jerry Leichter)

I found Charles Perkins's reply to my earlier article refreshing.  While he
and I may disagree on some issues, his article is at least reasoned and
provides a basis for further discussion.  I'll respond because I think doing
so can help to further clarify the issues.

        Jerry Leichter knocks down a straw man

Perhaps - but it wasn't *my* straw man; it was Brock Meeks who raised the
arguments to which I was responding.

                                               in his argument that free
        market concerns (about cryptograpy and the clipper chip) should not
        take precedence over public interest and safety.  He correctly argues
        that we have regulations for our safety.  However, his article assumes
        that the proposed regulations will safeguard citizens' safety and
        interests in a manner similar to current automotive and industrial
        regulations.  I do not share this assumption.  In fact, I am afraid
        that these proposals will reduce my safety and compromise my own
        interests.

This is a disagreement on issues of fact.  Unfortunately, it's difficult to
know what the actual facts are.  I'll be the first to admit that the FBI has
done an incompetent job of arguing *its* facts.  (In fact, I'm rather upset
with the general incompetence my government has shown in arguing the facts of
almost anything of late.  If we've become a nation of special interest groups
spouting propaganda as "facts," then unfortunately our government has become
just another of those groups.  It's been said that institutions come to
resemble their opponents.  All too true.)

Absent facts, one has to reason.  My reasoning is based on a couple of related
points:

        - If you look at white-color crime prosecutions, you will quickly come
        to the conclusion that success requires that the prosecution get their
        hands on records and communications.  Often, the basis of the prosecu-
        tion case is testimony from participants who've been "turned" as a
        result of deals offered to them; but it's the records and intercepted
        communications that clinch the case.  Personally, I think that's a
        good thing:  I'd rather not see a system in which people are regularly
        convicted solely on the basis of testimony "bought" from their part-
        ners in crime.

        - Everyone talks about the fact that we are moving into "the informa-
        tion age," where wealth and power will be in information, not in
        manufactured objects.  But consider what this implies for crime:  If
        wealth is in information, it is information that will be the object
        of crime.  I hate to use drug traffickers as an example, since "drug
        lords" are so over-used as bogey men; but it happens that on this
        front the drug criminals are among the leaders.  High-level drug
        criminals deal in information, not drugs.  They need never come near
        their products.  What they do is arrange shipments, deals, payoffs,
        what have you, from a distance.  An attack against them must be made
        against the center of their business - their communications - not
        against the margins (say, individual "drug mules", carrying a few
        pounds of whatever across the border).

        - It's much easier and cheaper to build features into a large system
        than to add them later.  That's why the argument "well, we haven't
        seen a problem with getting taps yet, so let's wait" is so dangerous.
        It's like the famous joke of the man who falls off a 50-story building
        and is heard to say, as he passes the 5th floor, "Everything's fine
        so far."  One need only look at the nature of the networks and ser-
        vices that are being built to know that traditional techniques are
        rapidly becoming obsolete, and that without technical help from the
        network designers, nothing can reasonably replace them.

        By the way, I find the complaints from the telephone companies that
        $500 million won't be enough to upgrade their equipment (a) evidence
        of this problem (if you believe it's $500 million or more now, what
        would it cost 10 years from now?) (b) absurdly high, and probably
        made by the same people who estimated that an E911 document cost
        $75,000, or whatever that wonderful number was.
        
Consider also the following quote from EPIC's statement, which appeared in the
same issue of CuD:

        Indeed, the telecommunications industry has consistently maintained
        that it is unaware of any instances in which a communications carrier
        has been unable to comply with law enforcement's requirements.

As I read the FBI Wiretap Bill currently under discussion, this statement
shows that the current system provides the required facilities.  Cost of
compliance:  $0.00!  What are the telco's complaining about, then?  Do they
perhaps realize that it won't be so simple to comply in the future?

        I am not concerned about the ethical use of the powers of observation
        that would be created by the digital telephony proposals.  I AM
        concerned about the unethical uses.  The unethical uses by government
        officials

We've dealt with unethical behavior by government officials through laws and
checks and balances.  The current bill - much improved over previous versions
in this regard - contains additional safeguards of this sort.  Procedural
safeguards can never be perfect; nothing devised by human beings ever is.  But
to blind oneself to the cost of alternatives in the search for perfection does
more harm than good.

                  or criminals (anyone using these avenues without authority
        but with the technical ability and illicit knowlege.)

If there's little evidence for widespread problems by law enforcement in its
use of the current system, there's even less for this.  In any case, one of
the important changes between earlier versions of the bill and this one are
the removal of requirements that the government initiate the taps itself.
Under the current proposal, as in the current system, the telco's are to do it
at government request.  Besides being yet another check and balance, and
another place where records that might demonstrate abuses will be stored, this
eliminates the (perhaps not so far-fetched) fear of the super-hacker who gains
access to the government-controlled remote tapping equipment.  Certainly, even
in such a system, criminals can bribe or pressure telco employees - but anyone
who thinks the telco itself cannot gain access to the data it carries is
kidding himself.  Whether for billing or network management purposes, the
telco's will have this capability, even if it's in a form that may not be
particularly useful for a government tap.  (That, by the way, is one reason I
find the telco cost estimates so absurdly high.)

In any case, the traditional telephone system was a triviality for anyone with
minimal technical knowledge and a few dollars of equipment to tap into.  If
tapping by criminals wasn't a big concern for that system, why the worry now?

                                                               I also am
        concerned about the precedent this would set.  I would like to think
        that I have a right to privacy in my communications with others.

You do.  The Constitution guarantees "The right of the people to be secure in
their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and
seizures...."  But the same Fourth Amendment goes on to describe how a legiti-
mate warrant, under which searches and seizures are permissible, is to be
issued.  Law isn't a set of abstractions; it's the practical basis for civil
society.  "Both rich and poor have the right to sleep under bridges."  A law
has to be implementable, or it's just words on paper.

The Constitution, and any codification of laws, is a tradeoff between the
liberties of individuals and other individuals, and between individuals and
the common polity.  Not even the rights to life (in the sense of the Declara-
tion of Independence!) and liberty are absolute - criminals can be jailed or
even executed, and anyone can be drafted in time of war or other emergency.
Why should a right to privacy in communications be more important than life
or liberty?

Subject: File 3--Florida obscenity trial - implication for artists

The following item is reproduced from Reason magazine.  It may be
of interest, as I see a chilling resemblance to the recent
Tennessee prosecution of a California bulletin board operator.

==================================================================
COMIC INJUSTICE
A Florida obscenity trial may have wide implications for artists

By Nick Gillespie
"Reason" (ISSN 0048-6906) Sept/Oct 1994

When 24-year-old artist Michael Diana sold two copies of his
self-published comic book "Boiled Angel" to undercover deputy
sheriffs in Florida's Pinellas County, he didn't exactly profit
from the sale.  Instead, Diana was arrested and charged with
publishing, advertising and distributing obscene materials.

At his trial last April, Diana's jury agreed with witnesses for
the prosecution who testified that "Boiled Angel" had no literary
or artistic merit and that it appealed only to "deviant groups"
and "those who have a libertine bent in their thinking."  Diana,
who faced a possible prison stay of three years, was sentenced to
three years' probation and fined $3,000.

Under the terms of his probation, he must perform eight hours of
community service a week, attend and pay for a course in
journalistic ethics, and submit to periodic searches to confirm
he is no longer producing obscene material.  And because Diana
must also refrain from all contact with anyone younger than 18,
he has lost his job as a clerk at his father's convenience store.

Ironically, the copies bought by undercover policemen were
Diana's only local sales.  Diana sent "Boiled Angels", which sold
about 300 copies per issue, through the mail only to subscribers
in the United States, France, Australia and Africa.  The comic
consists of illustrated stories and poems attacking Christianity
and depicting serial murders, satanic rituals, sexual assaults,
and cannibalism.  Diana testified in court that he intended his
work to be "a mirror to our society, to show its problems."  But
after his sentencing, Diana said, "I won't do anything that might
be considered obscene."

Seth Friedman, the publisher of "Factsheet Five", a San
Francisco-based review of underground comics, says he believes
Diana's conviction will "absolutely" have a chilling effect on
artistic expression, even outside the comic-book community.
"Especially if you live in a non-urban part of the country," says
Friedman, "you realize you have to be very, very careful if your
work deals with sexuality or religion."  Friedman, who testified
on Diana's behalf, doubts the comic-book artist would have been
convicted -- or even tried -- in a more cosmopolitan setting.

But he notes that small-town successes will likely encourage
prosecutors in bugger cities to try similar cases.  "This sort of
censorship will lead to larger things if it's not snuffed out at
the source," says Friedman.

"Top Secret Data Encryption Techniques", Held, 1993, 0-672-30293-4,
U$24.95/C$31.95

This book is a lot of fun, and may even be of some use.  A number of
ciphering techniques are outlined, and the interested hobbyist can
undoubtedly come up with many variations on the themes.  The included
source code, in BASIC, is simple and straightforward, and can easily
be modified to suit new ideas.

Fun, and possibly useful, but definitely *not* top secret.  Of the
five chapters that actually deal with encipherment, three deal
strictly with mono-alphabetic substitution.  Regardless of how complex
the substitution, a one-to-one correspondence is susceptible to either
character frequency analysis or brute force cracking.  The remaining
two chapters deal with poly-alphabetic substitutions that are still,
because of the fact of substitution, subject to brute force attacks.
(The one exception is the generation of a "one time" pad.)

Advanced encryption is currently the province of higher mathematics.
Explanations and sample code for these would require more
sophistication than the current book demands.  Still, it would not
have been impossible to include them, and it might have improved the
scope of the book.

Simple, and subject to attack, or not, the techniques in the book can
be used for some measure of privacy and security.  As stated in the
preface, even crackable codes may raise the expense of getting at the
data beyond its worth.

RELEASE:  94-138

NASA AWARDS INTERNET GRANTS AND COOPERATIVE AGREEMENTS

     NASA today selected 15 organizations to receive a total of
$20 million to help develop applications and technologies as a
part of the Agency's efforts to provide public use of Earth and
space science data over the Internet.  Some of the projects are
joint ventures that also will receive funding through other
sources.

     The remote sensing database (RSDB) applications will make
the information more accessible to a wider audience than in the
past.  The digital library technology (DLT ) projects will
advance the technologies in use by digital libraries and offer
new paths for the libraries of tomorrow.

     These selections closely follow the Remote Sensing Public
Access Center award announced Aug. 8, 1994.  Additional RSDB
application and DLT awards will be made in the near future.

...

     The projects are part of the Information Infrastructure
Technology and Applications program administered from NASA
Headquarters, Washington, D.C., with technical management
provided by Goddard Space Flight Center, Greenbelt, Md.
