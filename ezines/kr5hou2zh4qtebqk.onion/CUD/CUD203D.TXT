***  CuD #2.03: File 4 of 4: A Comment on the Zod Case           ***
********************************************************************


 I hope to present you with some of the details regarding Zod's bust so
 that your readers can be more familiar with the case.  Sometime around
 late October 1989 or so, Zod set up a multi user chat system on a US Air
 Force system.  The program he was using was Hans Kornedor's chat program ,
 which many of you may recognize as the chat program used on the ALTOS
 german hacker chat systems.  In any case, Zod modified this program,
 making superficial changes and labelled it TDON chat.

 What he did was infiltrate a US Air Force UNIX system at Andrews Air Force
 Base.  Because of the extremely lax security on the system, he was easily
 able to gain super user privileges and set up an SUID shell in one of the
 directories.  He then changed the password on an unused account (Foster.
 Password was TDON) and set his TDON chat system up.  He then went onto
 places such as TCHH (Germany), ALTGER (Germany) and QSD (France) and
 started spreading the news of this great new chat.  Thankfully, not many
 people paid any attention to Zod (who is world reknown to be a class "A"
 bozo.)  Very few people called and of those who did, it was mostly
 american users on telenet, although there were a few european callers as
 well.  I was actually invited to the system by an up and coming VAX/VMS
 hacker who used the alias 'Corrupt' (he was part of the group HiJiNx!).  I
 knew him from meetings on the various european chat systems as well as him
 being on the Corrupt Computing Canada BBS System in Toronto, Canada.  Last
 I heard, he was busted as well, although I am not sure of on what charges.

 The chat itself was up for maybe a week -- a week and a half at best.  At
 this point you are probably wondering who would be suicidal enough to set
 up a hacker chat system on a US Air Force system, right?  Well, there's
 more to Zod's stupidity than just that.  In addition to setting up the
 chat, Zod decided that he would be smart and in the .login script for the
 foster account he added in the TEE command to log everything to a file.
 For those unfamiliar with UNIX, the tee command basically takes the input
 coming into the user's TTY, and makes a copy of it into a specified file.
 Zod had this input go into a directory with the filename the same as the
 user's process ID.  I guess Zod's intention was to at a later time peruse
 these files for useful information, but what he ended up doing was handing
 us all to the authorities on a silver platter.

 Now one of the modifications that Zod had made to the chat program was to
 add in a shell escape.  I never did figure out what the escape sequence
 was (not that I ever looked very hard), but I noticed that if I lifted my
 phone up, (thereby sending garbage over the modem) and put it back down, I
 would automatically be plopped into the shell!  It was here that I
 discovered all the craziness that Zod had set up.  You can imagine my
 surprise when I looked at some of the files in my directory and discovered
 that this chat system had been set up on a military unix machine!  It was
 then that I found all the TEE'd files, the source code to his TDON chat,
 and the SUID root shell.  Again for those unfamiliar with unix, an SUID
 root shell basically allows a user to run this file and gain superuser
 privileges by temporarily changing their User ID to that of root
 (superuser).  Those familiar with hacking unix's will agree that it is
 never a good idea to leave such a file around on a system since it can be
 easily detected if not hidden properly.  Not only was this file NOT
 hidden, it was put in plain view of the system administrator!  If my
 memory serves correctly, it was put into the /tmp directory under a very
 obvious filename!

 Of course, the biggest problem with this particular set up was the TEE'd
 log files that zod had created.  Those files had some very far reaching
 consequences as I shall describe in just a minute.  Because of Zod's
 generosity in logging all chat sessions, Air Force Security staff had no
 reason to do any additional logging of information.  What the security
 staff did was first of all change the password on the foster/tdon account
 and then made backups of all the chat session files.  These were then
 compiled into a huge document (looks to be about 800-900 pages) and was
 edited to take out overlapping chat processes.  I have managed to acquire
 this document through a friend of mine who was recently charged for
 infiltrating several systems.  Part of the evidence was that document
 submitted by the Andrews Air Force base.

 For the benefit of those people who called this chat and who gave out
 incriminating evidence, I will just briefly list their names.  You guys
 should realize that your particular sessions were logged and are included
 as part of the evidence.  I would not be surprised if a further
 investigation stemming from Zod's bust were to be carried out.  The people
 who should be watching their tails are: Sam Brown, Hunter, Phreakenstein,
 Outlaw, Corrupt and Jetscream.  These are obviously not the only people
 who were logged, but they do represent those who passed out accounts and
 passwords and other incriminating information on the chat, as well as
 having spent the most amount of time on there.

 So how does this lead up to Zod's arrest?  Well, I'm not positive.  On the
 Air Force machine, zod was dumb enough to leave his name plastered all
 over the chat including on the logon screen.  Of course this cannot be
 used solely as evidence enough to convict, but it sure as hell points in
 his direction.  Zod was also not a very careful person -- this is of
 course obvious from him having set up the Air Force Chat, but in addition,
 he left behind a lot of clues.  He wasn't a very competent hacker and never
 cleaned up after himself.  I assume it wasn't very difficult to track him
 down from his blatant misuse of the City University system in Washington.
 It is my understanding that Corrupt and others were busted indirectly
 because of him.  Perhaps someone closer to the source can confirm this.

 In any case, what all this goes to show you is how the stupidity of one
 individual can lead to the problems of so many others.  By setting up a
 hacker chat system on the Andrews Air Force base system, he committed a
 great mistake.  By then inviting so many hackers from the international
 hack scene, he committed a greater sin.  But for actually logging all this
 information and never deleting it, he committed the ultimate crime.  This
 kid is a royal pain in the posterior and a serious threat to all hackers.
