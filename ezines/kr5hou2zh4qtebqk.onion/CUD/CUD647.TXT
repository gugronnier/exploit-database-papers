DIGICASH PRESS RELEASE

World's first electronic cash payment over computer networks.
=============================================================

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
(Release Date: May 27, 1994)

==========================

Payment from any personal computer to any other workstation, over
email or Internet, has been demonstrated for the first time, using
electronic cash technology. "You can pay for access to a database, buy
nsoftware or a newsletter by email, play a computer game over the net,
receive $5 owed you by a friend, or just order a pizza. The
possibilities are truly unlimited" according to David Chaum, Managing
Director of DigiCash TM, who announced and demonstrated the product
during his keynote address at the first conference on the World Wide
Web, in Geneva this week.

Electronic cash has the privacy of paper cash, while achieving the
high security required for electronic network environments
exclusively through innovations in public key cryptography. "It's the
first software only solution. In the past we've pioneered such cash
for chip cards and electronic wallets, always with a tamper-resistant
chip for storing the value--now all you have to do is download the
software and you're up and running" continues Dr. Chaum.

The product works with Microsoft(R) Windows TM, Macintosh TM, and
most UNIX TM platforms. It was shown integrated with Mosaic, the
most popular software for people accessing databases, email, or other
services on the Internet and World Wide Web. The graphic user
interface allows intuitive "dragging and dropping" of icons
representing stacks of coins, receipts, record books, etc.

The company will be supplying the technology through other firms who
will release the products, under various cooperation and trial
programs. The user software, which allows both paying and receiving
payment, will be distributed free of charge.

The product was developed by DigiCash TM Corporation's wholly owned
Dutch subsidiary, DigiCash TM BV. It is related to the firm's earlier
released product for road pricing, which has been licensed to Amtech TM
Corporation, of Dallas, Texas, worldwide leader in automatic road
toll collection. This system allows privacy protected payments for
road use at full highway speed from a smart card reader affixed to the
inside of a vehicle. Also related is the approach of the EU supported
CAFE project, of which Dr. Chaum is Chairman, which uses
tamper-resistant chips inserted into electronic wallets.

The underlying 'blind signature' technology was described in the
article "Achieving Electronic Privacy," by David Chaum, Scientific
American, August 1992.

                      Announcing: The Electronic Cafe

Imagine a place where access to the Internet is as easy as buying a
paper; where you can exchange knowledge and ideas with millions of
people worldwide. Imagine a focus for the interface between your local
community and the global community of the Internet.

You are thinking about the Ecafe - a community comining music, art and
imagination with the resources of a global network, a centre of
activity where ordinary people can use the facilities of the Internet
within their everyday lives.

Bringing together a music venue, a cafe and a connection to the
Internet, the Ecafe will give people access in a social setting. It
will provide local community information, educational resources,
electronic publishing, graphic design and an audience which spans the
globe.

It will be a place for people to gather, a place of education and
creativity, a place where everyone is equal, providing a link to 15
million minds at the speed of light. The Ecafe will be this and more,
evolving via the imagination of its users into a local meeting place
in the global community.

The Electronic Cafe is simple in its goal; to provide Internet access
to the general public, but the Ecafe will be more than just another
connection onto the Internet. It will provide access for the public to
the vast array of information sources available and help people to add
to that resource, giving them the equipment to explore the creativity
waiting to be discovered within this new medium.

If you would like to find out more about the Ecafe then point your web
browser to:

http://www.cyberspace.org/u/ecafe/www/index.html

or Email ecafe@cyberspace.org

The Ecafe is scheduled to open by the end of this year in London.  We
are currently looking for backers and sponsors to support the project,
if you would like to discuss the Ecafe in more detail, or perhaps even
write an article, I would be only to happy to meet you. I am available
in the UK over the next month and in America during July.

Following is a post summing up the problems we are having on a local
publicly owned BBS.  Any advice?

--Jim Maroon

======================================================================
This message was from JIM MAROON to ALL
originally in conference GeneralPub
and was forwarded to you by JIM MAROON
                    ----------------------------------------



        Most of you have no doubt heard about the problems at the Tulare
County Office of Education BBS.  I found out when a couple of
conferences I used were withdrawn, but then reinstated.  Well, I have
picked around here and there and think I have a handle on what is going
on, as well as some thoughts on how we ought to approach this.

        You are going to read in the Times Delta (our local newspaper)
an article on this sometime this week.  Among other things, the Delta
article will report this as a county employee using county time and
equipment to push personal political views.  That is not what this is
really about.  This is about book burning.  This is not about liberal vs
conservative politics.  This is about silencing voices with which we
disagree through political maneuvering.

        Apparently, some individual (one of my fellow "liberal"
Democrats) objected to the content of some of the messages that were
being posted on some of the conferences on TCOE.  He also felt
that most of the posts and conferences were too conservative. Now, I
know we liberals are outnumbered here in Tulare County, so it makes
sense that most posts are going to be conservative in nature.  Instead
of coming out and debating the posters of these messages, thus fighting
speech with speech, as would be the truly democratic approach, this
individual instead chose to go behind the scenes and complain.   The
problem this censor had, however, was how does one go about censoring
without looking like a censor?  Well, he found a device.

        One of the jobs of a sysop, in my opinion, is to encourage
conversation.  One way to do that is to pass on controversial positions
now and then.  It is not possible to be a sysop and not state one's
views on occasion.  Roger Smith (we all know who the sysop is, so there
is no need keep it out of this post) saw a message on an echo (the
verbatim reproduction of the Paula Jones vs Bill Clinton brief) and
forwarded it to the Soundoff echo.  This took a total of about 4
seconds.  Admittedly, Roger could have done this at home, but is this
really a big deal?  Of course it isn't, and our censor knew that, but
this was the proverbial foot in the door.  He used this as an excuse to
silence at least a half dozen echoes, Soundoff being one of them.  Would
he have complained about this had it been a post that praised the
President or took another shot at Dan "The Target" Quail or Rush "Slim"
Limbaugh or Ross "Ears" Perot?  Of course not.  He did this because he
objected to the political content of the speech involved, not because of
where and when it was done.  So, these echoes are no more.  They are not
gone because they were unpopular.  They are gone because they are
conservative, and one person found that unfair.  They may or may not be
back.

        TCOE is bound by the First Amendment.  We are going to see more
and more public institutions going online, and in the future that will
be the primary mode of getting online.  That is why this issue is so
important.  This is not about some petty local political squabble.  This
is about the legal right to access information in an unfettered manner
on a publicly funded BBS, regardless of political beliefs of the poster
or the content of their posts.  This is about the right to speak and the
right to read.  It is legally no different from the Internet. The courts
have held that if a government institution provides a meeting room to
anybody, it cannot refuse access to that meeting room to any group based
on the religious or political beliefs of that group.  Well, I see (and
the courts would see) a conference as identical.  The courts have found
that publicly funded universities could not remove Internet listservs
based on objection the content of those listservs, or block access to
e-mail or bbs echoes.

        A BBS is just a bunch of folks sitting around talking. You can't
dictate what speech is allowed and what speech is not allowed on a BBS
run by a government institution.

NZ pilots Apple online Network

by Adrienne Perry

Apple Computer's new online information service is about to be piloted
at 150 New Zealand sites before it launches worldwide in a few months.

The pilot is part of an international test of the service that will
compete with established online information networks such as
Compuserve and Internet.

e-World was announced by Apple at the Macworld computer show in San
Francisco in January, and since then Apple has been constructing the
database and signing up content providers.

Apple agent CED Distributors will market the product in New Zealand.
Managing director Alex Broughton says there will be a strong emphasis
on local content, and e-World's as yet undisclosed pricing will be
competitive with Compuserve.

He says e-World will have an advantage over Internet in that the user
interface will employ Apple's traditional user-friendliness and it
will be very easy to navigate the service and find areas of interest.
e-world will contain gateways into Compuserve and Internet.

Initially, Apple intends to convert the 50-60,000 world-wide users of
Applelink --- Apple's international e-mail service --- over to
e-world.  By the end of this year, e-World software will be bundled
with every Apple computer sold.

Apple computers account for about 12 per cent of the world's personal
computers.  However, e-World will also be available on PC-Windows, and
should those sales take off the service could rapidly become a serious
competitor for Compuserve.

Mr Broughton says Apple Computers is exploring e-World software
bundling deals with leading PC vendors in the United States.

New Zealand pilot sites include banks, media and accounting firms, all
levels of education, user groups, resellers, software houses,
telecommunications carriers and IT managers.

There is already a wide range of content on e-World.

A Learning Centre contains Groliers Encyclopaedia, while an Arts and
Leisure pavilion houses information about films, music, horoscopes,
and the entertainment world.

Electronic shopping will be available, and United States outdoor
equipment retailer LL Bean is already selling its wares on the
service.  Retailers will probably supply full product details on
CD-Rom as demand dictates, Mr Broughton says.

The shopping corner will also include third-party Apple software
products and a full Mac catalogue.

The newstand will house news and commentary.  Already online are USA
Today, Reuters, and some information technology publications.
Subscribers can isolate areas of interest and ask e-World to deliver
on-line articles on those subjects at prescribed times.

The Community Centre offers a multitude of forums for international
conversations in groups or one-on-one sessions, while the Finance and
Business Centre offers stockmarket news, investment advice, company
profiles, teleworking advice, and live sessions with, for example,
marketing guru Regis McKenna.

Mr Broughton says New Zealand exporters could advertise their wares on
the service.

He says e-World can handle moving images and full interactive
multi-media but it is limited by the lack of fibre optic cabling, and
further developments will depend on network providers.

e-World will run over 9600 baud lines to local BT (British Telecom)
nodes in Auckland, Wellington and Christchurch then direct to a
California Stratus-based system.

--------------------

(gnat speaking again).

I *hate* closed systems.  It looks like Apple have learned nothing
about the direction of the last 20 years.  How many people will
seriously want to advertise on Apple's system, when advertising on the
Internet would reach a far larger audience?  The gullible ones, I
guess.

As for Apple's e-World givng a friendly interface to the Internet,
it's about time that someone pointed Apple at NCSA Mosaic.  Come to
think of it, someone already has.  They're running an HTTP server.  Is
it really true that Apple are offering multimedia through the
networks?!  Gosh, I wish we'd thought of that for the World Wide Web.

At least it's not as bad as last week's classic offering by the IT
Weekly, where we were told that the Internet only has a text-based
user interface.  This was from people trying to sell Hyper-G, mind
you.  No mention of the Web at all.

It looks like Apple are reinventing O'Reilly's GNN (http://gnn.com/)
at considerable expense, and isolating the corporate customers that
advertise with them from the biggest on-line audience around.

Bah, and humbug.

Subject: File 5--CYBERSAM VS MIND CONTROL

Copyright 1994 by W.H. Bowart

An excerpt from
OPERATION MIND CONTROL
BOOK TWO

CYBERSAM
>From The Cybernetic Samisdat


It's not easy to make a living as an investigative journalist.  It's
far easier to make a living writing advertorials, advertising paid
garbage for affluent markets. But when you are compelled by a concern
for truth, justice and what once was "the American way" to write about
subjects that threaten the cryptocracy's plans you could find it hard
to get published. What with most of the publishers of books,
magazines, radio and television broadcast news departments having an
cryptocracy agent in place, little gets out about things such as mind
control. As a matter of fact, that's one reason to suspect any news of
this kind that you read in the papers or see on the "happytalk" TV
news.

It's worth repeating the findings of the CIA's internal "Task Force on
Greater CIA Openness": "...the public Affairs Office of the CIA now
has relationships with reporters from every major wire service,
newspaper, news weekly and television network in the nation... This
has helped us turn some 'intelligence failure' stories into
'intelligence success' stories... In many instances, we have persuaded
reporters to postpone, change, hold or even scrap stories that could
have adversely affected national security interests...1"

The independent researcher of supressed subjects is left to struggle
and strive. Once you could write books like this (Operation Mind
Control) on an advance from a book publisher, but seldom any more. Few
of the major publishers have the courage or the commitment to
constitutional principles to take the chance and buck the invisible
system. The establishment press has been co-opted. We are left with a
people's news network, a samisdat.  In the more innocent days of the
1960's, the sociologist Tamotsu Shibutani concluded: "Various elite
groups may seize institutional channels and persuade others to accept
ideas that legitimize their ascendancy, but such advantages are
generally temporary. Regardless of their formal philosophies most men
are pragmatic in their actual orientation toward their world; a
premium is placed upon accurate knowledge, for the simple reason that
errors in the long run lead to painful consequences. Thus, successful
politicians may; gain temporary ascendancy through devious maneuvers,
but before long their victims become suspicious and their colleagues
cynical. So long as there is some disparity of interests between those
who control institutional channels and others, some situations are
bound to be interpreted through rumors..."2

"Although tyranny is not new," Shibutani wrote, "thoughtful men in
recent years have become increasingly alarmed over awesome prospects
arising from the development of effective techniques of political
subjugation and control, especially through the manipulation of
beliefs. In the last analysis political power rests on the consent or
acquiescence of the governed, but if the views of men can be
manipulated, is there any safeguard to limit the power of those who
control the channels of communication?"

Since the passage of the National Security Act, government lying
became institutionalized. In the 1950's and 1960s, U.S. Army planes
carried out biological warfare attacks against American and Canadian
cities by spraying them with supposedly harmless bacteria. The army
told local officials it was just testing a radar-deflecting chaff.
While the bacteria was supposed to be harmless, several people's
deaths are attributed to it.

History will show that more freedoms were lost and more lies told
during the 12 years George Bush was at the helm of the United States
(as both V.P. to a senile movie actor President, then as his
sucessor). The Bush administration drafted regulations on the use of
deception to provide cover for secret programs.

The regulations are part of the National Industrial Security Program
Operating Manual, which sets forth security procedures for government
agencies and contractors involved with classified programs The
Department of Defense wrote a supplement to the manual for "special
access" (read that "black") programs, whose existence could not even
be acknowledged. Dated May 29, 1992, and stamped "draft" the
supplement stated:

"Cover stories may be established for unacknowledged programs in order
to protect the integrity of the program from individuals who do not
have a need to know. Cover stories must be believable and cannot
reveal any information regarding the true nature of the contract.
Cover stories for Special Access Programs must have the approval of
the PSO (Program Security Officer) prior to dissemination."

The Scientific American commented: " The supplement also notes that
special access programs must have 'nonattributable' telephone lines,
also called 'Hello lines,' connecting them to the outside world.
Personnel who answer such a telephone must 'state the proper
salutation, e.g. Good Morning or Hello. Do not use the company name.'"

Who's paying the bills of government? The people who don't have the
need to know, right? Does this mean we no longer live in a democratic
republic?

During the last years of the Soviet Union, in the decay of the
totalitarian regime that was called communism, when repression was
complete, the press controlled by the state,  there came from the west
two revolutionary tools:  satellite television and the photocopy
machine. Through the round the clock news reports broadcast from CNN
the repressed people of the Soviet Union learned the truth about the
rest of the world. Through the capability of instant publication  made
possible by the technology of "dryography", the photocopy and fax
machines allowed the people to communicate with each other despite the
official channels of communication. The government controlled
newspapers, magazines and news programs on the government controlled
radio and television stations were reduced by the new technology to
mere trivial forms of entertainment.  People would turn on the
"official news" just to have a good laugh. Informed by their grass
roots samisdat they could laugh at the transparent propaganda which
was pumped through the institutional news channels. The people knew
what was happening through  their underground press -- clandestine
dryography machines working through the night putting out the truth,
circulated hand-to-hand by a network of citizens.

The new electronic technology has affected us too. We in America, for
the first time, can look in on any revolution anywhere -- live. We
might even be a part of them without leaving our desks. Here's Whole
Earth Review Editor, Howard Rheingold writing in his book Virtual
Community:

"I was following an eyewitness report from Moscow during the coup
attempt, or China during the Tiananmen Square incident, or Israel and
Kuwait during the Gulf War, passed directly from citizen to citizen
through an ad hoc network patched together from cheap computers and
ordinary telephone lines, cutting across normal geographic and
political boundaries by piggybacking on the global communications
infrastructure...

"People in virtual communities use words on screens to exchange
pleasantries and argue, engage in intellectural discourse, conduct
commerce, exchange knowledge, share emotional support, make plans,
brainstorm, gossip, feud, fall in love, find friends and lose them,
play games, flirt, create a little high art and a lot of idle talk.
People in virtual communities do just about everything people do in
real life, but we leave our bodies behind. You can't kiss anybody and
nobody can punch you in the nose, but a lot can happen within those
boundaries. To the millions who have been drawn into it, the richness
and vitality of computer-linked cultures is attractive, even
addictive.

"There's no such thing as a single, monolithic, online subculture;
it's more like an ecosystem of subcultures, some frivolous, others
serious. The cutting edge of scientific discourse is migrating to
virtual communities, where you can read the electronic pre-preprinted
reports of molecular biologist and cognitive scientists. At the same
time, activits and educational reformers are using the same medium as
a political tool. You can use virtual communities to find a date, sell
a lawnmower, publish a novel, conduct a meeting..."

The free press, it once was said, belongs to him who owns the press.
Now, today, it belongs to him who has access to the internet. The free
press is dead in the "establishment" media, but it's alive and well in
cyberspace.  Electronic bulletin boards and e-mail and  computer
networks are carrying a good deal of the truth which flies in the face
of all the official reports and government propaganda. ( Though beware
of disinformation.)

As an editorial in the first MONDO2000 reflected the size and shape
and climate of the burgeoning cyberspace. It's all about: "what to do
until the millennium comes. We're talking about Total Possibilities.
Radical assaults on the limiits of biology, gravity and time. The end
of Artificial Scarcity.  The dawn of a new humanism. High-jacking
technology for personal empowerment, fun and games. Flexing those
synapses! Stoking those neuropeptides! Making Bliss States our normal
waking consciousness. Becoming the Bionic Angel... But things are
going to get weirder before they get better. The Rupture before the
Rapture. Social and economic dislocation that will make the Cracked
80's look like summer camp..."

And it's not all happening on screens. A lot of it finds it way into
the finality of print -- the old fashioned way -- but not in the
"establishment press," in the samisdat. When I founded the Underground
Press Syndicate (UPS) in 1965 there were only five papers. UPS grew
within a few years to contain a 200 periodical membership with
millions of readers. Now there's a magazine that just reviews
underground, alternative and fringe publication. At last count there
were an estimated 5000 plus regularly published "zines" of all shapes
and sizes devoted to all sorts of themes and ideas. Here is art and
here is literature and here in the samisdat is truth that might make
it's way into the "mainstream" in years to come, meanwhile it's
happening now.

Cyberpunk cryptowriter for  MONDO2000, Xandor Korzybski offered a
piece entitled Mind Kontrol Ultra3:

"Remember, when you wake up agitated at 3:00 in the morning , that's
when they're running ELF transmitters to program your dreams. It's
also the time when most UFOs appear -- quelle coincidence! Let me
explain: They send out subliminal signals over all radio and TV
channels and use microwave antennas to beam instructions via ELF
modulation into your heads to reinforce hypnotic screen memories of
alien doctors in spaceships, when they're actually Frankensteinian
Nazi scientists running bizarre eugenics experiments in underground
tunnels created by massive subterranean machines which are the cause
of that slowly moving hum you hear underground in Taos and other parts
of the Southwest.

"But you don't have to have an intranasal brain implant to be under
their control. Hemisync tone sequences, subliminal instructions,
reverse-speech hidden messages, magnetic signals, infrasonics,
ultrasoncis (like Hitler) are all part of the total panoply. And throw
away your Synchro-Energizer: the CIA programs mind-machine circuitry
to create zombie automatons. In fact, the entire candybrain New Age
movement invented by LSD monger Willis Harman under directions from
the British Tavistock Institute in London, is a massive MI6-controlled
deception operation designed to hypnotize millions and convert them
into slaves to the New World Order..."

Obviously Xandor's wisdom was formed by his interface with cyberspace
dissolved lightly in psychedelics. Paranoid? Perhaps just accurate and
insightful reporting.

 And the days of the freedom of cyberspace may be numbered, at least
the days of the "information highway" as a medium of free expression
are numbered. A bill making mandatory the insertion of a "Clipper
Chip", a government proprietary encryption device, has been proposed
and looks like it will be passed into law. This chip ( in one form or
another) will be installed in every phone, every computer, every fax
machine, whether or not this version of the bill passes Congress or
not. Eventually some version of it will pass and that will give the
NSA, CIA and FBI the right to read over your shoulder.  It will give
them the ability to read the private mail of citizens and business
alike without your knowledge. While insisting that this is merely in
the interests of national security, the real reason, it would appear,
is so that the cryptocracy can get "hot business tips" and know which
way to shift the black ops funds for fatter profits outside the
public's purview. When this happens, only the gullible or the cunning
will send anything but the most trivial communications on this
"information highway."

Far more prevalent and reliable a form of communication is the
papersam, a paper "information highway" upon which news is transferred
hand-to-hand in photocopy format. On one 100+ page document I received
( a paper on the murders of civilians by ATF and FBI agents at Waco,
Texas) the cover page of the photocopied document read: "A.P.F.N. ( of
which I still haven't figured the meaning)= "Friends FAXING Friends...
for FREEDOM". It was followed by the observation: "... no conspiracy
can survive expose'.

Some of the information in this artifact you hold in your hands, came
to our attention through this "network of friends faxing friends( or
E-mailing or swapping photocopies)". Much of the information herein
has been verified, but much also has not. ( Hopefully, future editions
of this book will evolve to weed out the disinformation.) To our best
estimates as much as 1/3 of the information could be untrue due to
deliberately planted "disinformation", lies which have been sown by
the cryptocracy to mislead and confuse us. In this edition (Book Two)
We have used information that has been verified by at least three
sources. That rule produce 100% accuracy in the first edition (Book
One). Some things which have appeared in photocopy or via e-mail or
downloaded files have been deleted because, unlike the practice in
transitory cyberspace, in the fixity of print they must be considered
libelous until proven true.

The reader is encouraged to network with others and tap into the rich
flow of the cybernetic samisdat (cybersam) -- probably our only source
of reliable communication in the information age. You can trust that
all the cryptocracy's secrets will be revealed eventually in the
cybernetic samisdat (cybersam.) There are patriots at work even within
the closets of the secret agencies. The CIA's phones are tapped. ( A
posting on Internet gave all the computer-link phone numbers of
government contractors working on high technology, and it is reported
on the samisdat that there's a mad scramble going on to disconnect all
secret government facilities from the Internet.  You think it's
because someone posted their secret access codes?) The NSA cryptocrats
are being remotely viewed at all times by patriots within their own
ranks.( NSA's "confidential -- not to leave the building" manual for
prospective employees was published on the net.)

The force of freedom urges all spirits toward the light. Secrecy is
not the light, does not promote truth, shall not make you free.
Secrecy protects the guilty, covers both crimes and mistakes, and
makes everyone suffer at least from incompetence for 20 years, or the
length of the classification term.

 A government is not smarter than its people. A people survives.
Governments do not. (So far.) And, thank you Dr. McLuhan: when
information travels at the speed of light there can be no secrecy -- (
nor copyrights. )

The strength of the brief human adventure  has come from the
creativity of the people and the free exchange of ideas. Creativity
thrives in chaos.  That's why the cybersam is so dynamic and alive. To
the degree that a cryptocracy would try to order the life of a nation,
to the degree that it would control and suppress the creativity of the
people is to the degree that it will fail, sinking into the quicksand
of its own secret codes.

"Ours is... a generation in which manipulation of outlook through
ingenious propagandistic devices is commonplace, where ruses,
unsubstantiated testimony, and doctored evidence play decisive parts
in local and national life," Shibutani wrote. ( And anyone who has
obtained their own FBI file under the Freedom of Information Act knows
what Shibutani is talking about.) "What makes decisions in such
unsettled times so important is that crises are the crucibles out of
which many innovations emerge; new modes of action often get their
initial direction in attempts to cope with emergencies..." ( One
wonders why Shibutani's Improvised News has been out of print for so
many years?)

"Our nation, our world is in crisis. It would appear that The New
World Order is being forced upon us, without our knowledge or consent.
We are not being informed about its purpose. We are not being educated
about its meaning. We have not been invited to participate in its
creation. Like the subjects of evil psychoscientists under pain/drug
hypnosis we are being used without our knowledge and against our wills
by a nameless, faceless cryptocracy which is engaged in a futile
struggle to keep its own existence secret at the expense of our
pursuit of happiness. But when information travels at the speed of
light there is no secrecy, so the people are becoming aware that this
Emperor too has no clothes.

"Rumors ...flourish in situations characterized by social unrest.
Those who undergo strain over a long period of time -- victims of
sustained bombings, survivors of a long epidemic, a conquered populace
coping with an army of occupation, civilians grown weary of a long
war, prisoners in a concentration camp, ( a nation whose leaders are
assassinated by lone nuts),  residents of neighborhoods marked by
interethnic tension -- become restless and dissatisfied" Shibutani
wrote. "...whenever individuals experience impulses that cannot be
satisfied within the existing social framework, they become restless.
They feel balked, insecure, alienated, and often lonely. When those
who are similarly frustrated come together, they exchange views and
thereby reinforce and intensify one another's discomfort. When men are
collectively dissatisfied, the customary is called into question  and
those involved became acutely sensitized to possibilities of change...

"...if the demand for news in a public exceeds the supply made
available through institutional channels, rumor construction is likely
to occur."

"There is widespread agreement," Shibutani wrote," that known or
suspected censorship increases the incidence of rumors.

"Rumor is a substitute for news; in fact, it is news that does not
develop in institutional channels. Unsatisfied demand for news-- the
discrepancy between information needed to come to terms with a
changing environment and what is provided by formal news channels --
constitutes the crucial condition of rumor construction."

The information contained in the following pages has arrived here
through the alternative news channels of the information age. Only
time will tell how much we can depend upon these new channels.  The
following information is unofficial. It could be mistaken, but it is
published with the intention of discovering the truth. In the next
edition of this book, we'll  update this information, scoring its
reliability and accuracy. Regardless of the accuracy of minute
details, there seems to be a trend. The collective belief, the group
feeling is being expressed through the Cybersam:

"Have you figured it out yet?" Xandor Korzybsi asks. "OK, let me spell
it out for all you pathetic autists: They know exactly which ELF
frequencies, waveforms, and code sequences (brainwave-frequency region
pulse-code modulation superimposed widely on power lines, radio, TV,
and microwave transmissions) to use and can create any emotion or
pathology they please.  You don't. And you probably don't own a real
ELF detector! You poor bleating sheep don't even know they're ALREADY
using ELF generators in malls, restaurants, and bars to maximize
throughput and revenues -- even magnetizing fans in air conditioners
and refrigerators to create pulsed ELF waves to zap you. It will all
be duly captured by Hillary's SmartCard which will store your
brainwaves and monitor all transactions everywhere you go, so the
Thought Police can download it any old time via the data superhighway
and issue the ultimate ACCESS DENIED. By the way, you can't escape ELF
-- there's no way to shield low frequency magnetic waves ..."

The only hope is when all information does travel at the speed of
light.
