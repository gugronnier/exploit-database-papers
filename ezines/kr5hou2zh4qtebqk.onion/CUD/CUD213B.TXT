         get run over if you just sit there.

CPSR (Computer Professionals for Social Responsibility) and the EFF
(Electronic Frontier Foundation) have done a great deal in a very short
time to awaken the political consciousness of the electronic community.
The EFF managed to take some of the steam from the enforcement train
railroading members of the CU and gave this community its first taste of
political victory.  No doubt these victories will continue to strengthen
individual rights in the virtual world.  As a student of electronic
democracy, I am an ardent supporter of the goals expressed by the EFF.  the
goals expressed by the EFF.  With six years devoted to personal and
professional interest in the civil rights and political issues facing the
electronic community.

Jim Thomas has asked on several occasions that I write something for CuD
about The EPIC (Effective Performance in Candidates) Project, a nonprofit
group I founded last year.  A description of The EPIC Project is included
in this article as background information.  Political action by a nonprofit
is limited by law.  Most of what we learn about electronic politicking in
the nonprofit must be used elsewhere.  I was hired earlier this year to
help qualify a citizen initiative for the November elections in California.
The measure included a provision making public use of computer
telecommunications a state constitutional right.  This article focuses on
that effort and concludes with a notice of plans underway for 1992.

The EPIC Project

This project is an extension of research conducted at Sacramento State
University focusing on the impact of electronic democracy in American
politics.  We *may* have created a back-door link of computer
telecommunication technology to the U.S. Constitution (Campaign Industry
News, Feb. 1990).  We're years away from solving the dependent variable
dilemma of a Supreme Court test.  Board members include Dave Hughes (the
founding father of electronic democracy) and Dr. Gene Shoemaker,
constitutional scholar and author of the War Powers Act (1974).  Projects
include R&D of software to insure text data integrity from a network
distribution source via end user verification software; research into the
development of national electronic political party organizations
(Communications Daily, 2-2-90), and; research compiled on the Sundevil
raids assisted Ohio Supreme Court Justice William McMahon, ABA Technology
and the Courts Committee chairman, in opening a Sundevil subcommittee
looking into federal court rule changes.  This subcommittee and Judge
McMahon are now working closely with the EFF.

Political Action and Electronic Rights

With all the consternation over abused constitutional rights in the online
community this year, Californians missed an opportunity to vote themselves
a Constitutional Right to telecommunicate.  Below is part of the opening
text from a file containing a print, sign and snail mail ballot initiative
signature petition to qualify a proposed California Constitutional
Amendment for the November 1990 general election (Western Edition WSJ
4-20-90; Middlesex News 4-23-90).  I directed the statewide electronic file
distribution and speech forums:

         CALIFORNIANS FOR RESPONSIBLE REPRESENTATION
        INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY -- ELECTRONIC CITIZENS
                            and
                  THE CALIFORNIA CONSTITUTION
                        are linked by
               THE FAIR REDISTRICTING INITIATIVE

  What your signature and signatures which you gather can do for you and
your family (and your business), is provide a Constitutional Right to
electronic citizen oversight of Legislative redistricting plans -- right in
your home computer --if you like!

  There are now NO RULES for drawing voting district lines to establish a
competitive election process.  The FAIR REDISTRICTING INITIATIVE lays out
specific rules to PREVENT REPETITION OF PAST ABUSES BY INCUMBENT
POLITICIANS and eliminates the possibility of gerrymandering -- the drawing
of electoral district lines to protect incumbents and deny fair
representation.  One of the most important SECTIONS included in this
Initiative creates electronic citizen oversight of redistricting or
reapportionment plans drafted by the Legislature before any legislative
action:

  SECTION 5:  The Legislature shall DISSEMINATE and make PUBLICLY
available, in hard copy and COMPUTER-READABLE FORMAT, any data base or
other information submitted or developed for its use in establishing and
redistricting or reapportionment plans...

NO PLANS WILL BE DRAWN BEHIND CLOSED DOORS TO PROTECT INCUMBENT POWER THAT
DESTROYS YOUR RIGHT TO REPRESENTATIVE GOVERNMENT.  THE INITIATIVE PROVIDES
A CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT TO KNOW PLANS BEFORE ANY ACTION IS TAKEN -- IN
COMPUTER-READABLE FORMAT WITH ELECTRONIC CITIZEN OVERSIGHT.

                        IT'S ABOUT TIME FOR
      THE BEGINNING OF INFORMATION AGE DEMOCRACY IN CALIFORNIA

  Are you ready to join other people of the world in this era our
politicians praise as the "Decade of Democracy?"  Are you tired of cheering
the democratic victories of others?  Your opportunity to take action in the
name of DEMOCRACY is right in front of you.  The Revolutionary Power of the
Information Age is at your fingertips. THE FAIR REDISTRICTING INITIATIVE
lets you put that power to work for you!!
                            *** end ***

In addition to the first effort at state level constitutional rights to
telecommunicate, and to access government data in electronic form, this was
the first statewide electronic distribution of print and sign political
action material.  In April and May of this year, issues about
constitutional rights were still considered boring as dirt to most of the
online community.

The discussions that follow are excerpts from a WELL conference
on the initiative.  It is not presented as a representative
sample and is reprinted with permission.

Jeff Aldrich (jefrich)      Mon, Apr 23, '90  (22:35)      18

   One item I've noticed absent from this discussion is any reference to
the fact that this initiative, if passed, will link this technology to the
Ca Constitution by creating a constitutionally mandated right of public
access to specific info in "computer-readable" format.

   With the volume of discussion I've seen in the Well on Electronic
Citizenship and the need for same, I find it rather odd there has yet been
commentary posted on this aspect of the initiative.  And what about the
fact that for the first time in Ca history an initiative is being
distributed, in complete form, electronically -- giving people an
opportunity to make an informed decision prior to signing a petition to
qualify a measure for statewide ballot?  Instead of some fellow pushing a
pen at you to sign something on an ironing board when you leave the grocery
store.

 Jeff:  I think you're looking at Fenno's paradox.  Look at what people
think of *their* representative, not Congress as a whole.  For the most
part, people support their representative, and where they don't (e.g.
Cranston) it's clear they aren't likely prospects for reelection.

 In the long run, information access would tend to produce a better
informed electorate.  If you don't think the GOP takes public apathy and
stupidity to the bank and the ballot box year after year, you haven't been
paying attention!

 The GOP don't have a monopoly on taking voter stupidity to the bank. The
Democrats also have a specialty: economic shell games that take advantage
of voters' lack of knowledge of basic economic principles like supply and
demand, incentive, etc.

# 32: Jeff Aldrich (jefrich)      Wed, Apr 25, '90  (18:02)

 The fact is, while we sit around on our butt's chewing the finer points of
who's doing what to who, we're all loosing the right to access government
data information.  I just got a report today from the firm in Sacramento
counting signatures on petitions that have come in.  The few we've received
on computer printed paper are from sysop's I've been working with -- Zero
from the Well.

 The point is we have an opportunity to open a door that is closed and
being welded shut. I'm beginning to wonder if all the talk here in the Well
about how great the concept of Electronic Citizenship is -- protect our
future, power to those without power, etc. -- was little more than
sanctimonious rubbish.

Topic 333:  Californians seek Information Age Democracy -- print
# 33: Bob Jacobson (bluefire)      Wed, Apr 25, '90  (18:34)

 I think an initiative targeted on open information would be clearer,
easier to understand, less expensive to run, and more certain of passage.

Topic 333:  Californians seek Information Age Democracy -- print
# 34: Daniel A. Murphy (murphy)      Wed, Apr 25, '90  (18:54)

 I agree completely with Bob.  Better information access would help the
process; it shouldn't me mixed up with a reapportionment scheme.

Topic 333:  Californians seek Information Age Democracy -- print
# 35: David Gans (tnf)      Wed, Apr 25, '90  (20:02)       2

 And phrases like "sanctimonious rubbish" aren't likely to
inspire very many people around here.

# 36: Jeff Aldrich (jefrich)      Thu, Apr 26, '90  (01:53)

 Your right, David, that remark does not belong here.

 Bob's right on all four items.  Such an initiative would be easier to
understand and pass.  But I don't have any problems with constitutional
access tied to this initiative.  Neither does the Rose Institute at
Clairmont.  My difficulty is understanding the inactivity from the Well.

# 37: Robert Deward (bobd)      Thu, Apr 26, '90  (13:37)       6

 Are there any models for an initiative addressing open access to govt.
information?  I can check with Reference Point if no one has anything
handy.

 This sounds to me like a perfect issue on which to test our beliefs about
the efficacy of the on-line medium.  What do you people think?

Topic 333:  Californians seek Information Age Democracy -- print
# 38: Daniel A. Murphy (murphy)      Thu, Apr 26, '90  (18:41)

 It will be interesting to see if electronically-circulated petitions
become common, as part of conventional signature-gathering campaigns.

 Gee, Bobd, sounds like this project would have been a perfect
match for your Electronic Citizenship project with a Gateway!

 Any objection from posters so far to my copying this out for Colorado
candidate for Secretary of State Aaron Harber (D)?  (He is a Harvard grad,
serious challenger, owned two computer companies, and forced the current
incumbent to better automate the SecStates office last race. One of his
main themes is better citizen access to government, and he is ready for
fresh electronic communications ideas to show voters that the Repub Sec of
State is not doing all she could to use modern technology to give people
that access.

 He is mulling over my suggestion to use the state telecom network (sorry
US West) which is little used nights and weekends to put terminals in
county offices for free citizen access to state government in Denver across
a wide range of info - including state laws, regs, voter lists, licensing
data, candidate reports etc)  He might find this useful to think how to
break out of the traditional mind-set about where/how 'official' political
information is stored/distributed.

 It seems to me that the objection above about individual citizens not
being that interested in mountains of facts misses a point. There are
always local activists who would scour such facts, extract useful info, and
present to local people. If they had timely, cheap, and total access to
publicly stored info.  Media is supposed to be doing this 'for the voters'
and up to a point, on hot 'mass interest' topics do. But news media are
decliningly useful sources of information about government.

# 42: Jeff Aldrich (jefrich)      Tue, May  1, '90  (21:45)

 the latest signature count has too many printed petition forms from all
over the state for me to trace back to the well.  I suspect several came
from Wellies...thanks for the effort

 Bob, my research has yet uncovered a 'model access' amendment.  If we
can't come up with one ready-made, anyone with ideas on using resources
here in the Well to pull one together for Calif.  in '92?  Or failing that,
what about ideas on our ability to pull the industry together to support
such an effort?

      +-+-+-+-+-+ END OF WELL CONFERENCE +-+-+-+-+-+

Most of the discussion in the WELL conference focused on the politics
behind the measure, rather than looking at benefits extended to the
electronic community.  It's said that timing in politics is everything.  If
concerns about Operation Sundevil had been two months earlier, or our
filing deadlines two months later, The FAIR REDISTRICTING INITIATIVE would
have collected enough signatures to qualify for the November General
Election.

Initiative '92 -- Computer Rights and Economic Impact on Business

We learned a lot about the online community from distributing the ballot
measure earlier this year -- from identifying politically active systems
statewide, to distribution, to political issues considered palatable by the
electronic community.  Successful efforts to promote computer rights and
industry growth utilizing the electronic distribution initiative process in
California offer a range of policy issues including, but not limited to,
the following:

legislative info in data format dispensed at no cost to info service
companies providing educational access; incentives for development of rural
telecommuting centers, including a) increased rate of return on investment
for rural telephone utilities, b) redirecting transportation funds to
reduce site construction and development costs, c) business tax incentives
for participation in rural telecommunicating centers; revision of computer
crime statutes and enforcement procedures; association member access to,
and use of, California State University computer systems for the purpose of
increasing international trade in conjunction with the California State
World Trade Commission, and; add telecommuting projects to the smart
Freeway Corridor Telecommunications Demonstration Project by redirection of
Federal Transportation Appropriations.

There is no question all of these items will be considered in the drafting
of a 1992 California ballot measure.  The measure will also include
language mandating that computer telecommunications become a state
constitutional right.  Many of the issues listed above have the potential
to create positive economic impact for general business, trade associations
and specific computer industries.  As a focal point of the initiative,
Rural telecommuting development cuts to a broad based, organized
constituency.

I've been retained by clients interested in forming a committee to sponsor
development of this initiative.  I have been asked to determine the
support, if any, of others interested in forming a sponsor committee.  And
to determine if the level of this support is sufficient to justify further
activity.

   Committee membership guidelines:

   Committee Member Sponsor  $7,500.00     < per 1 vote >

   Total Committee Member Sponsors            < ten >

   Minimum Committee Member Sponsors to vest  < five >

   Committee will vest January 7, 1991.

   Letters of intent to fund are due and payable no latter than
   January 4, 1991.  Failure to vest refunds are due and payable
   January 17, 1991.

measure committee, contact:
