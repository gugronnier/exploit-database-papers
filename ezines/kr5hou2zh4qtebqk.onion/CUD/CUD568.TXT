((MODERATORS' NOTE:  We continue our bibliographic resource series of
special issues.  If you are not interested in maintaining
bibliographies for research or other purposes, then you can stop
reading about here.  But, if you're into the academic/research game,
here's a wealth of cites.  This issue summarizes THE INFORMATION
SOCIETY, an eclectic multidiscpllinary journal. Although we do not
generally run long "promo blurbs," this one is an exception, because
it includes a helpful bibliography directly related to cyberspace
issues. Thanks to Rob Kling for pulling it together)).

             journal, published quarterly by Taylor & Francis

                         THE INFORMATION SOCIETY
                         An International Journal

   An "information revolution" is clearly underway.  The exponential
growth in computational capability per unit dollar will continue at least
for the next several decades.  Communication bandwidth is undergoing
simultaneous exponential growth.  Connectivity among individuals,
companies and nations is forming what some are calling "worldnet",
"cyberspace", "global grid" or"the matrix." These combined trends are
leading us into an Information Society in which wealth, power and freedom
of action derive from access to, and effective use of, information.

   "The Information Society" journal, published since 1981, is a forum for
thoughtful commentary about impacts, policies, system concepts and
methodologies related to these trends.  It is a refereed journal that
publishes scholarly articles, positon papers, short communications and
book reviews on these topics.

   "The Information Society" is a multidisciplinary journal whose audience
includes policy- and decision-makers and scientists in government,
industry and education; managers concerned with the effects of the
information revolution on individuals, organizations and society; and
academic researchers and others with an interest in issues regarding the
Information Society.

   Among the topics addressed within the journal are:

   * the implications of the coming surge in electronic data interchange
     (EDI) among businesses globally,

   * the ability of companies to "outsource" portions of their information
     processing to different countries around the world, creating
     transborder data flow issues for the countries involved and
     increasing the rapidity with which jobs migrate globally,

   * fear of cultural imperialism and inundation,

   * options for, and implications of, various forms of "electronic
     democracy",

   * the rise of "virtual communities" of persons worldwide engaging in
     many-to-many" communication among their participants, irrespective
     of borders or corporate structures.
