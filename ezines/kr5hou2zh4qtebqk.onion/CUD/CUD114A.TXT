Gordon Meyer's Subversive Thesis
-----------------

An inside source reported to us that Omar Stanford, who was indicted in
Missouri for alleged phreaking, has had all the charges against him dropped
by local authorities. They also returned all of his software and
equipment......EXCEPT FOR the infamous M.A. thesis by Gordon Meyer. No
reason was given for the failure to return it.

-------------------
Withdrawal of Some Archives
--------------------

We have been informed that files to be used for evidence against Craig
Neidorf include those in our archives.  As a result, we will not accept
requests for Phracks 19, 22, 23 or 24.  Although we find such repression
abhorent, and although it would seem to constitute a challenge to
legitimate research interests, we feel it best to err on the side of
caution and have succumbed to the "chilling effect."
