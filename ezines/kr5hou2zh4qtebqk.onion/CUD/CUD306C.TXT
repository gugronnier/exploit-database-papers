***  CuD #3.06: File 3 of 6: CuD Archive Server                  ***
********************************************************************

Some people seem to be having problems using the email archive server based
here.  Here are some helpful hints:

a) place all commands to the archive server in the BODY of the message.  The
   server will ignore commands on the subject line.

b) do not use any slashes ('/') in any command.  The server does not know
   how to handle commands with slashes in the command.

c) use the "path" command.  Although we do have a fairly smart mailer, it's
   not foolproof.  This is especially true for sites that are not directly
   on the Internet.  UUCP sites should locate a node on the Internet (like
   uunet) and use it as a base.  Bitnet sites should add the suffix .bitnet
   to the end of their hostname.  For example:

        path uunet.uu.net!nexthost!myhost!me
        path me@bithost.bitnet

   This should eliminate problems getting to you.

d) If you're asking for many files, it helps to break up the send command
   into multiple files.  This is especially true for large files.  For example:

        send cud cud1.01
        send cud cud1.02
        send cud cud1.03
   is better than
        send cud cud1.01 cud1.02 cud1.03

e) Some helpful commands that the server knows:

       index
       index cud
       send cud cud-arch
       send cud chsun1.email.files

   Also, try and keep the files you request per send command to under 45000
   bytes.  Anything much larger than that will not be sent.  If you want
   very large files, send a special request to
   archive-management@chsun1.uchicago.edu and special arrangements will be
   made.

f) This is not the address for requesting futures issues of CuD to be mailed
   to you.  You should send those requests to: TK0JUT2@NIU.bitnet
   and place the address for being placed on the mailing list.

Thanks,
  Bob Kusumoto
