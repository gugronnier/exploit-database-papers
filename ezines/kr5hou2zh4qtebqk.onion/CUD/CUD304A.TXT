Len Rose Update
+++++++++++++++++++

Len Rose's trial, originally scheduled for January 28, has been pushed back to
April 1 because of a superceding indictment related to the same facts. Len is
currently represented by Catterton, Kemp, and Mason of Rockville, Md.
The EFF's amicus brief in the case is available from the CuD archives or
directly from EFF.

+++++++++++++++++++++++
First Conference on Computers, Freedom and Privacy
+++++++++++++++++++++++++

Don't forget The First Conference On Computers, Freedom and Privacy coming
up on March 25-28. The conference will be held at the Airport SFO Marriott
Hotel in Burlingame (that's the San Francisco Airport about 15 minutes
south of the city for out-of-towners).  All are invited, but participation
is limited to the first 600 registering.  For more information, contact
JWARREN@WELL.SF.CA.US or WELL!JWARREN@APPLE.COM

FTP Info and Widener Crash
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

The Widener ftp site is experiencing some problems and is down for awhile.
But, the others are currently working.  Back issues of cuds on Compuserve
are in: DL0 of the IBMBBS sig.  Added to the archives: A dozen more state
computer statutes, NIA #69 (which came out last month), Phantasy #4, and a
few other things. An anonymous contributor also deposited about a dozen or
more university computer policies/regulations in the "legal" directory
which are well worth reading. Thanks to the donor!  Brian Peretti also send
over his "Computer Publication and the First Amendment," which we also
recommend.
