Subject: 2--Are You Ready for the Revolution?!

This may have been posted before, I'm not sure. My apologies if it has:

Are You Ready for the Revolution?!
         ----------------------------------

African-Americans and the Information Revolution
a One-day Conference

The Purpose:

America is at the beginnings of a revolution in telecommunications
that promises to fundamentally alter the way in which we do
business, the way in which we learn, the way in which we interact,
and the way in which we spend our leisure time.

But are you, is Black America, ready for the Revolution?

The facts would seem to suggest that the African-American community
is ill-prepared to take advantage of this revolution.  The call is
going out for the leadership, for the visionaries in the community
to assemble to discuss African-Americans, technology and the 21st
century.

When:

September 14th, 1994, The First Day of the Congressional Black
Caucus Legislative Weekend

Who Should attend:

Industry executives, foundation executives, government officials,
minority business owners, community and political activists,
educators and cultural leaders

Hosted by:

The Congressional Black Caucus Foundation and American Visions
magazine

To Register:

Call 202-675-6736; or fax 202 547-3807

            COMPUTER PROFESSIONALS FOR SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY
                             ANNUAL MEETING

                          October 8 - 9, 1994

                  University of California, San Diego
                             Price Center
                       La Jolla, California, USA

                         Organizing for Access:
                          A National Forum on
          Computer Networking, Community Action, and Democracy


************************************************************************


In the few short years since the first proposals for a National
Information Infrastructure (NII), a broad social movement has arisen
to put that vision into action in communities across the country.
A remarkable range of people -- educators, librarians, community
activists, computer people, government agencies, advocates for people
with disabilities, and others -- have been using computer networks to
deliver services and to organize themselves behind an emerging agenda
for computing and networking in the public interest.  CPSR is convening
this meeting for all people interested in the place of computer
technology in society, with the goal of bringing together a wide range
of voices to discuss the ways in which the NII might serve the needs
of society and to empower one another to pursue shared goals in the
new technological world.  Our meeting this year will place particular
emphasis on providing would-be activists with the skills and connections
they need to put the vision of democratic technology into practice.


Saturday, October 8th

 8:00 -  9:00   Registration/Coffee


 9:00 -  9:15   Welcome to the CPSR Annual Meeting
                  Phil Agre


 9:15 - 10:15   Keynote address
                  Francois Bar
                  Department of Communication, UCSD

                "Staking Claims to the Network"

    This is a critical time for grass-roots involvement in shaping
    America's communications networks.  National policy-making has
    largely deferred issues of encouraging broad access, preventing
    network fragmentation, and guaranteeing basic individual rights
    and freedoms.  Francois Bar argues that broad-based access and
    involvement today are critical -- not as charity, but because
    the network's future can only be imagined and discovered through
    broad-based and sustained experimentation by end-users.


10:15 - 10:45   Break


10:45 - 12:30   Panel Discussion -- Moderated by Steve Miller

                "The Meanings of Access"

    The theme of "access" has united numerous groups interested in
    ensuring equity in the NII.  But "access" is a complex concept with
    many equally important facets.  This panel brings together leading
    voices for community access to technology to compare and contrast
    the various technical, social, and institutional meanings of access.

  Panelists:
    Karen Coyle, University of California Library Automation and CPSR-Berkeley
    Lee Felsenstein, Interval Research and Berkeley Community Memory
    Deborah Kaplan, World Institute on Disability
    Larry Shaw, The Exploratorium
    Armando Valdez, LatinoNet


12:30 -  2:00   Lunch Break


 2:00 -  3:30   Panel Discussion -- Moderated by Kathleen Kells

                "Privacy and Intellectual Freedom"

    Privacy and intellectual freedom are crucial information rights
    shared by all people.  Protecting these rights is a full-time job,
    one that brings the members of several professions into day-to-day
    contact with the the diverse and complicated circumstances in which
    real people need to exercise them.  This panel features a discussion
    among three national leaders in the defense of these rights.

  Panelists:
    Beth Givens, Privacy Rights Clearinghouse, University of San Diego
    Judith Krug, Office for Intellectual Freedom, American Library Association
    Gary Richwald, Department of Health Services, County of Los Angeles


 3:30 -  4:00   Break


 4:00 -  5:45   Panel Discussion -- Moderated by Rik Belew

                "Community Networking in San Diego"

    Our host community of San Diego makes a fine "case study" for all of
    our meeting's topics.  In this panel, five active community members
    describe the remarkable range of networking projects going on around
    San Diego, placing them in the context of the region's economic and
    institutional evolution.

   Panelists:
    Nell Allen, Department of Social Services, County of San Diego
    Marcia Boruta, San Diego Economic Conversion Council
    Sandra Hall, Community Activist
    Al Rogers, Global SchoolNet Foundation
    Mike Stark, San Diego Computer Society


 5:45 -  6:00   Closing Remarks -- Judi Clark

 7:00 -  7:30   No Host Bar at Banquet Site

 7:30 - 10:30   CPSR Banquet - Fundraiser - UCSD Faculty Club

     (Vegetarian food will be available)

   * Presentation of the 1993 Norbert Wiener Award

   * Banquet Address -- Patricia Glass Schuman, Neal-Schuman Publishers

     "Safeguarding the Right to Know"

     Patricia Glass Schuman, librarian, businesswoman and activist
     for free speech, was 1991-92 president of the American Library
     Association (ALA).  As ALA President, Schuman launched a series
     of "radio rallies" to focus public attention on threats to the
     public's Right to Know.  Hear her call for information activism
     that involves the entire community in strengthening democracy
     by defending and expanding everyone's access to information.


************************************************************************


Sunday, October 9th


 8:30 -  9:00   Coffee


 9:00 - 10:00   Featured speaker
                  Sonia Jarvis
                  National Coalition on Black Voter Participation

                "The Public-Interest Aspects of the Information Superhighway"

    Legislators in Washington are now making policies that will affect
    everyone's ability to join in the social and political activities
    that make up a democracy.  How can we make sure that those who
    are not technologically literate will have an opportunity to
    participate?  Sonia Jarvis will initiate a dialog on strategies
    for ensuring that the public interest is given proper consideration.


10:00 - 10:15   Short Break


10:15 - 12:15   Workshops

    Now is the time for everyone to become an activist for democratic
    uses of information technology.  No matter what expertise you have
    to offer, or what contribution you'd like to make -- whether it's
    running a bulletin board, starting an on-line discussion group for
    people with a shared interest, organizing a computer network to
    serve your community's needs, helping to protect everyone's privacy
    in a world of computer databases, getting new people into the
    electronic world, joining the larger public-interest movement, or
    drawing on the resources of the net to get people the information
    they need to make informed choices in a democracy -- the necessary
    skills, tools, and connections are readily available.  In these
    seven workshops, national experts on technology activism will tell
    you how to get started with your own good deeds on Monday morning.
    More detailed descriptions of each workshop will be available
    sometime in September.

                               ABOUT CPSR

Computer Professionals for Social Responsibility is a national,
non-partisan, public-interest organization dedicated to understanding
and directing the impact of computers on society.  Decisions regarding
the use of this technology have far-reaching consequences that
necessarily reflect the basic values and priorities of the people who
govern their use.

Founded in 1981, CPSR has 1800 members from all over the United States
and 21 chapters.  Each of our members is an important participant in
the dialogue that is helping to shape the future use of computers in the
United States.  Our National Advisory Board includes one Nobel laureate
and three winners of the Turing Award, the highest honor in computer
science.  CPSR published the influential report "Serving the Community"
on policy issues in the National Information Infrastructure, and is
an active participant in the Telecommunications Policy Roundtable in
Washington.

We believe that as the influence of computers continues to permeate
every aspect of our society, it is important that professionals become
active participants in formulating the policy that governs computer
use and access.  CPSR welcomes any and all who share our convictions,
whether they work as computer professionals or not.
