FTP INSTRUCTIONS
-------------------------------

     Here is a script of a login via ftp.

     You can get a directory by specifying the CuD directory
in the path (ie...  ftp> dir tmp/ftp/CuD.)

# ftp 128.95.136.2
Connected to 128.95.136.2.
220 blake FTP server (Version 4.174 Sat Apr 1 06:11:40 PST 1989) ready.
Name (128.95.136.2:llo): anonymous
331 Guest login ok, send ident as password.
Password:
230 Guest login ok, access restrictions apply.
ftp> bin
200 Type set to I.
ftp> mget tmp/ftp/CuD/*
ftp> bye
221 Goodbye.
# uncompress CuD_1.*

That should do it.
:NOTE: The above command 'mget CuD*' will retrieve all of that publication.
You could just as easily type: 'cd tmp/ftp/CuD' and then 'ls' or 'dir' to
see the files available to choose from.

CuD POLICY REVISITED
----------------------

We remind contributors to be sure that copyrights are not violated.  We
have been unable to reprint some news stories because they risk going
beyond fair use doctrine on copyright stories.  For the time being, we are
also restricting some files until legal issues surrounding them are
resolved. Unfortunately, prosecutors are less than open about what
constitutes an "illegal file," so we are erring on the side of caution.
This is one example of the CHILLING EFFECT. The legality of information
dissemination is decided after the fact, leaving sysops, moderators, and
others, in a rather precarious state.
