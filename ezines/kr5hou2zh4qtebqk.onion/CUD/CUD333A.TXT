WIDENER FTP ADDRESS CHANGE
++++++++++++

The Internet address for ftp.cs.widener.edu (aka
ashley.cs.widener.edu) will be changing from its current of
192.55.239.132 to 147.31.254.20

INFO ON "OTHER VICTIMS" WANTED
+++++++++

We are putting together a story on the "other victims" of the 1990
searches/seizures by the Secret Service that focuses on the problems
various raids caused for those who where touched by, but not directly
involved in, those events. We're compiling a list of short, narrative
stories that can each be summarized in a few paragraphs.

If you or anybody you know was an indirect "victim," it would help if you
would send us their name and an email or voice phone means of contacting
them. If people have been victimized, but prefer anonymity, we can tell
the story without the name:

PHRACK 33
+++++++++

Phrack 33 (release date 1 Sept, '91) is out and can be obtained from
the Cud archvives. FREE SPEECH BBS, Phrack's home board, will be up in
a week or so, but may periodically be down for maintenance while
testing some of the new features.  The new number is (618) 549-4955.

++++++++++
NY BBS TAX
++++++++++

New York state has enacted a law that would appear to place a tax on
BBSs that sell or exchange software. Although there is some confusion
regarding the intent and applicability of the law, most agree that it
is, at best, a poor worded and potentially harmful piece of
legislation. The next Cu Digest (3.34) will be a special issue devoted
to the law.

+++++++
INFO ON THESES/DISSERTATIONS WANTED
+++++++

We've received a few responses from people working on graduate theses
or dissertations related to computer culture or computer crime. We'll
put out the information, along with a list of the few that have been
completed so far, but it appears that, to date, there are very, very
few. If you or somebody you know is working on a related project, let
us know in the next few weeks so we can include it in the
bibliography.
