Hello, I got this forwarded to me from DEC's Vogon news service.  If
Logisticon gets away with this, it's going to put some real knots in any
future anti-hacking statutes.

Logisticon - Repossesses some programs electronically over payment dispute

        {The Wall Street Journal, 25-Oct-90, p. A5}

  Logisticon, a tiny Silicon Valley software maker has lent new meaning to the
term repossession, using phone lines to tap into Revlon Inc. computers and
disable programs that the software company claims Revlon didn't properly [sic
- pay (?) TT] for properly. Revlon sued Logisticon in a California state
court Monday, charging that Revlon suffered financial loss when two warehouses
couldn't ship products because of the disabled software. A Revlon spokesman
said the company withheld payment from Logisticon because the software had
bugs and didn't perform as promised. Logisticon president Don Gallagher calls
his company's action "repossession." Revlon, in its suit, calls it "an
extortion attempt." The software spat, first reported in the San Jose Mercury
News, illustrates a new use of the controversial practice of "hacking," in
which computer sleuths use phone lines to enter computers with the knowledge
of the computers' owner. It also shows the lengths to which a software company
may have to go to protect what it sees as its intellectual property rights.
"Software companies have to protect themselves," said Mr. Gallagher.

Logisticon sells inventory-management software around the world to such
companies as Ford Motor Co., Federal Express and Abbott Laboratories. Mr.
Gallagher said he received a letter Oct. 15 from Revlon saying that it
wouldn't pay $180,000 remaining on a $1.2 million contract to supply
warehouse-management software for Revlon warehouses in Phoenix, Ariz., and
Edison, N.J.. Revlon also canceled a $500,000 second phase, he said. As a
condition for payment of the $180,000, Revlon demanded that Logisticon give
Revlon free access to the basic software called source code, Mr. Gallagher
said. That would have allowed Revlon to freely duplicate Logisticon software
that would normally sell for millions of dollars, he said. The bugs in the
software were "minimal" and didn't hamper the operation of the system, he
maintained. When Revlon refused to settle the issue, Mr. Gallagher said, he
had employees use phone lines on Oct. 15 to disable Logisticon's software in
the Revlon warehouses "in such a way to render the total system inoperable,"
without harming Revlon's data. "We determined we had no recourse remaining,"
he said. Logisticon switched the software back on three days later. Revlon, in
its suit, charges that it wasn't able to ship products between Oct. 16 and
Oct. 19 while the system was off. Logisticon, Revlon said, used its
"familiarity with Revlon's system to commit ... extortionate acts." Logisticon
planted viruses in the program that it later activated, the suit claims.
