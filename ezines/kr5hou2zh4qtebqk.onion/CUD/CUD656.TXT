Subject: File 1--Tandy trying to shut down employee BBS?

[From CIS; this is just an informational forward, and does not represent
EFF positions or policy.]


Should your employer prohibit you from operating a BBS, on your own
equipment, at your own expense, on your own time with the threat of
being fired if you do?  It has happened! Tandy/Radio Shack did it to
one of their employees.  This is a press release of the incident.
Everyone should read this!

>>> NEWS RELEASE <<<

Dateline: San Luis Obispo, California

The Constitutional right of Freedom of Speech by using the Information
Superhighway is being roadblocked by Joseph Provenzano, one of the District
Managers for Radio Shack - a division of Tandy Corporation.

Ms. Rochelle C. Skwarla, one of the System Operators (SYSOP) for a local
hobby computer Bulletin Board System (BBS) and also an employee of Radio
Shack was advised to consider shutting down her system or leaving the
company.

Searchlight of San Luis Obispo, California has been in operation since
March 1990 and has become one of the largest, most popular, and well
respected BBSs on the Central California Coast.

Ms. Skwarla has also been employed by one of the local Radio Shack stores
since April 1991.

Ms. Skwarla and another coworker were advised on Saturday, May 14, 1994 by
the company that the operation of their free (donation optional) system was
a conflict of interest and she should choose one or the other.


Rochelle gave the following statement:

"I am a very strong believer in everyone's right to freedom of speech.
Preventing me from operating a free BBS would deny me and the many hundreds
of my callers this Constitutional freedom.  I cannot allow this to happen.
I don't really have much of a choice.  I am not only standing up for my own
rights, but most-importantly, for the rights of everyone to access and make
available the means to use the Information Superhighway.  If I allow my
employer to dictate to me what I can and can't do with my own equipment on
my own time, where will it end?"

"Their control stops at the timeclock.  If this were not so then everyone's
rights are in jeopardy.  Your employer could tell you that you can't do
such-and-such off the job.  For example: You work for an insurance company
that refuses to insure motorcycle riders because they consider them to be
too high a risk.  Now lets say you own some land which you allow off-road
bikers to use free.  Your employer says that this is a conflict of interest
and you can't do it.  Should this be allowed?  How about if you wrote a
letter to the local newspaper editor why you felt motorcycle riders should
not be discriminated against.  Should you be fired?"

"A computer Bulletin Board System, or Online Information Service as I
prefer to call them, is a form of media.  Something like a party line
telephone, mail, library, radio, television, magazine, and newspaper all
rolled into one.  Almost everything --books, letters, speeches, movies, and
songs-- are now available through electronic means.  How you access it is
through a BBS or OIS.  Some systems are free, others are not.  We are
talking about freedom of the press and the people.  The Information
Superhighway is just now starting to be built.  My system is one of the
on-ramps.  It is open to traffic and will continue to be so for years to
come.  I will fight this tooth and nail if I have to.  Like a turtle, you
will never get anywhere if you don't stick your neck out."

John V. Roach, CEO and Chairman, Tandy Corporation, Tandy Trends,
Volume 9, Number 1, Page 8: "...I urge you to contact your congressional
representatives'offices - either by phone or by mail - and let them know
that you cannot support these bills [H.R. 3626, H.R. 3636 & S.1822] unless
they protect your Right to Own, your Right to Choose, and your Right
of Access on the Information Superhighway."

>>> UPDATE: <<<

The week following the ultimatum Ms. Skwarla's weekly hours were cut back
to 15.  The following week to 8 1/2.  On May 27, 1994 her hours were cut
back to 0 and she was advised that her services would no longer be needed
at that store.

She made the following comment: "I am sorry it had to happen this way.
Instead of supporting access to the Information Superhighway, my employer's
actions spoke louder than their words.  Unfortunately for them it seems
that their attempt only backfired as this news release will travel along
the same route they attempted to stop.  This is going to hurt their
relationship with the public greatly."

Searchlight of San Luis Obispo, California, Online Information Service /
Bulletin Board System, (805) 549-0961 continues to be very active and
strong.

Rochelle Skwarla can be contacted at P.O. Box 5216, San Luis Obispo, CA
93403-5216; on her Bulletin Board System; on CompuServe at 74007,1230;

May 14, 1994

Dear Mr. Roach,

To quote you from Tandy Trends, Volume 9, Number 1, Page 8: "...I urge you
to contact your congressional representatives' offices - either by phone or
by mail - and let them know that you cannot support these bills unless they
protect your Right to Own, your Right to Choose, and your Right of Access
on the Information Superhighway."

It seems that one of the District Managers for Radio Shack, Mr. Joe
Provenzano of District 0577 does not share the same opinion.  My store
manager had the unfortunate duty to relay to me today that the D.M. felt
that the operation of a BBS by me and another coworker was a conflict of
interest and that I should consider choosing one or the other.

We have run our free (donation optional) BBS for over four years as a
hobby.  It originally was run on our first Tandy 1000 SL computer.  It
became so popular, we soon purchased a second Tandy 1000 TL/2 computer.
Today we own four PCs.  Our system is one of the largest, most popular,
and well respected  BBSs on the Central California Coast.

I have been employed by Radio Shack for over three years, having had three
different District Managers, and three different Store Managers.  My
previous job of six years was as an Executive Manager for a major oil
company (left for health reasons).  I have also held other major
supervisory positions.  I am no youngster in the business world.

I choose to work for Radio Shack because I wanted to, not because I had to.
I believed in the people, the company and the products, owning around
$10,000 worth myself (most of which I had purchased as Jane Q. Customer).
After today, I have a different opinion.

I am a very strong believer in everyone's right to freedom of speech, as it
seems you are.  Preventing me from operating a free BBS would deny me and
the many hundreds of my callers this Constitutional freedom.  I cannot
allow this to happen.  I don't really have much of a choice.
Mr. Provenzano is the type of D.M. that does not like resistance and has
shown this as well as being unreasonable toward some Managers and
Salesmakers since his recent reassignment to this area.  Based upon his
previous conduct, remaining with the company would not be favorable to me
regardless of my BBS outcome.  It seems that I will be forced to seek other
employment.

I realize that the loss of one employee does not mean much to the company
as a whole, however, thanks to the Information Superhighway the reasons of
my leaving will have a strong impact upon other employees, potential future
employees and customers.

Until today, it has been a pleasure working for Radio Shack.  Your comments
and opinion would be appreciated.

Sincerely,

(Ms.) Rochelle C. Skwarla

Superhighway.

Thank you.


We have had one interview with the local media today (newspaper).  Other
employees have been threatened with suspension if they talk about it to
anyone.  My Co-Sysop had today off from work (she works at the same store
I did).  We are concerned that she too will be terminated.  A can of
worms has been opened here.  We are up against a big company fighting for
the right of freedom of speech for everyone.  Help, opinions and
suggestions would be greatly appreciated.

Rochelle

---------- Forwarded message ----------

Date--12 Jun 94 22:31:22 EDT
From--Rochelle Skwarla <74007.1230@CompuServe.COM>
Subject--Tandy vs Sysop

A very big thank you to everyone that has been so supportive! I am doing a
mass mailing of this letter to those that have written to me.  I hope that
it gets to everyone correctly.  Please pass this around as things are
getting very busy out here and I don't have alot of free time (or money) to
write to everyone personally.  I'll try to answer a few of the most asked
questions.

Q: Is the story true?

A: If you have read an unmodified copy of BADTANDY.ZIP, it is true.
However, as the story goes around through the networks information can
sometimes be taken out of context or misquotes happen.  I can't say what you
read is true or not, but what I wrote originally is true.

Q: What did Radio Shack mean by a "Conflict of Interest"?

A: This seems to be the second most asked question.  Nobody has been able to
get an answer to this.  They could have said because the sky is blue and it
would have made just as much sense.

Q: Has this ever happened before?

A: Yes, At least once that I know of.  The sysop of one of the largest
Searchlight BBSs in the country, located in Provo, UT was a manager for a
Radio Shack store and got fired under the same circumstances a few years
ago.  I would be interested in hearing from any others that have had this
happen to them.

Q: What has Tandy/Radio Shack said so-far?

A: Nothing.  I have never received any replies from anyone since I was
laid-off.  I mailed out the letter to Mr.  Roach several weeks before I made
the news release public to give him an opportunity to respond and correct
the problem. Either he didn't care or didn't realize the impact this would
have.

Q: Are you going to take legal action?

A: Nothing has been decided yet.  The EFF and ACLU have been notified.  We
are considering every avenue.  This is a very important issue for EVERYONE,
modem users and nonusers alike.  A person's activity off the job should not
be regulated by your employer.  A prisoner can make millions with book and
movie rights about their crime(s) but a free citizen can be restricted from
doing something off the job by his/her employer? Something does not seem
right here.

Q: What is happening with the media?

A: Good question.  Computer publications understand the importance of this
issue.  The general media does not.  During interviews, I often have to
first explain what a BBS is (and is not) for the first 30 minutes.  Then
convince them why this situation is so important to everyone.  Some
reporters understand but are having difficulty getting their editors to.  It
is to my understanding that Sysop News will try to have the article in their
July issue even though the release came out after their cutoff date.  Our
local media ran into a few roadblocks when trying to obtain comments from
other RS employees (who were threatened with suspension if they said
anything).  I am sure that if the media can get anything out of the company,
some of it will be distorted. One reporter was able to get a few copies of
some material but the company left out one page which luckily I had a copy
of so was able to provide the missing piece.  But because I have no idea
what information (if any) they are getting, I can't always provide my
version or the missing pieces (I no-longer have access to company material
and have to rely on what copies I do have).  I don't like mud slinging and
have tried to avoid it in this matter.  I've only presented the facts
related to THIS situation, nothing else.  I don't need to bring up the
District Manager's sex life (of which I don't know anything about nor do I
care) or anything else not related.

Q: What else can I do to help?

A: Keep spreading the news.  Try to get the media to understand that this
issue is very important to everyone.  You can also write to the following
people/organizations and urge them to please get more involved: EFF
76711.317@compuserve.com, Lance Rose (Attorney at Law & author of SYSLAW)
72230.2044@compuserve.com, Jack Rickard (Editor of Boardwatch Magazine)
jack.rickard@boardwatch.com, Rush Limbaugh 70277.2502@compuserve.com, Your
local ACLU, and just about anyone else that you can think of.

Q: Does John V.  Roach, CEO and Chairman of Tandy Corporation have an
Internet address?

A: I have not been able to find this out.  There IS a tandy.com, but that is
as much as I can get.  If anyone else knows, let me and everyone know too.
I have had many requests for this.  A flood of e-mail could get him to pay
attention.

Q: How can I keep up on the latest?

A: Call our OIS/BBS (Online Information Service/Bulletin Board System).
Searchlight of San Luis Obispo, California, (805) 549-0961.  We have a
message area there titled UMU (United Modem Users).  We repost all e-mail
received, replies and updates.  If you have sent me e-mail at any of my
online addresses, the chances are good that it is posted and replied to in
that subboard.  If you are a sysop or cosysop, please leave me e-mail on the
board advising me of such. Include the OIS/BBS name and data number, so we
can adjust your account to reflect this.

Q: How can I contribute?

A: Donations are very much welcome and needed.  Our system has always been
free, with donations optional.  As with most hobby systems, we operate on a
shoestring.  A major hard drive failure occured at the same time all this
came down.  We managed to get it back up and running, but the repair
technician said that the HD was on it's last leg.  Not wanting to take a
chance and power the system down to remount the drive for fear it may not
crank up again, she sits on top of the open CPU until we can afford to get a
new one.  Because of the situation, it is very important to remain online at
any cost right now.  If you want to send us a buck or two, you can make your
check out to me, Rochelle Skwarla, P.O. Box 5216, San Luis Obispo, CA
93403-5216.  Because we are a hobby system, we do not have a business
account so can't cash a checks in the OIS/BBS name.  We will apply all
donations toward the direct operation of the system based upon the
importance, hardware, legal, etc.  Our system is operated out of our home by
two women (one now unemployed).  This isn't a plea, but some of you asked,
so I answered.

I am slightly awed to have received so many letters concerning (and
concerned with) my trouble with Radio Shack.  Feel free to call our system
for more information and updates.  Thank you all for your support and
encouragement.

Rochelle

  =============================================================

                 ENCRYPTION POLICY ENDANGERS U.S.
              COMPETITIVENESS IN GLOBAL MARKETPLACE


       For some time now, a debate has been raging in the media
  and in the halls of Congress over the Administration's
  intention to require U.S. corporations to use and market the
  Clipper Chip, an encryption device developed in secret by the
  National Security Agency.

       The Clipper Chip will provide industry and others with
  the ability to encode telephone and computer communications.
  The use of the Clipper Chip as the U.S. encryption standard
  is a concept promoted by both the intelligence and law
  enforcement communities because it is designed with a back
  door to make it relatively easy for these agencies to listen
  in on these communications.

       The law enforcement and intelligence communities have a
  legitimate concern that advances in technology will make
  their jobs more difficult.  But the issue here is whether
  attempts to restrict the development, use and export of
  encryption amounts to closing the barn door after the horse
  has already escaped.

       The notion that we can limit encryption is just plain
  fanciful.  Encryption technology is available worldwide --
  and will become more available as time goes on.

       First, generally available software with encryption
  capabilities is sold within the U.S. at thousands of retail
  outlets, by mail, even, over the phone.  These programs may
  be transferred abroad in minutes by anyone using a public
  telephone line and a computer modem.

       Second, it is estimated that over 200 products from
  some 22 countries -- including Great Britain, France,
  Germany, Russia, Japan, India, and South Africa -- use some
  form of the encryption that the Government currently
  prohibits U.S. companies from exporting.  According to the
  May 16, 1994 issue of _Fortune_, not only are U.S. companies
  willing to purchase foreign encryption devices, American
  producers of encrypted software are also moving production
  overseas to escape the current export controls.

       Third, encryption techniques and technology are well
  understood throughout the world.  Encryption is routinely
  taught in computer science programs.  Text books explain the
  underlying encryption technology.  International
  organizations have published protocols for implementing high
  level encryption.  Actual implementations of encryption --
  programs ready to use by even computer novices -- are on the
  Internet.

       The only result of continued U.S. export controls is
  to threaten the continued preeminence of America's computer
  software and hardware companies in world markets.  These
  restrictive policies jeopardize the health of American
  companies, and the jobs and revenues they generate.

       I support, therefore, the immediate revision of current
  export controls over encryption devices to comport with the
  reality of worldwide encryption availability.

       I believe law enforcement and the intelligence community
  would be better served by finding real, and targeted ways to
  deal with international terrorists and criminals rather than
  promoting scattershot policies, which restrict American
  industries' ability to design, produce and market technology.

       Now -- more than ever -- we cannot afford to harm our
  economic competitiveness and justify it in the name of
  national security.

quality newsletters. The quality of info contributed to what Mitch Kapor
describes as the Net's "gift economy" is amazing. However, despite some
excellent e-pub guides, tracking down good NEWSY letters can be
frustrating, partly because they get lost in the flood of zines and very
technical pubs.

  So this list aims to point people to the news-oriented net-letters with
somewhat broader appeal. It's not intended to be as comprehensive as other
guides, but helpful nevertheless. The list is tremendously biased toward
e-mail delivery. Very technical and fanzine newsletters are not included
because they are well covered by other guides.

  GIMME FEEDBACK!! This is just an initial stab, just 30 or so encountered
Gopher-trolling and from tips. Some are well-known, others are not. Send
me your favorite net-letters, particularly if you're the editor. Include
any subscription and archive infor mation.

  HOW TO GET THE NET-LETTER GUIDE: E-mail (higgins@dorsai.dorsai.org;
SUBSCRIBE NET-LETTER); Usenet (alt.zines, alt.etext, misc.writing,
rec.mag, alt.internet.services, and the *.answers groups). Fishing for
other arrangements. (Any volunteers?)

  Far more exhaustive lists of electronic publications include:
  John Labovitz's e-zine-list; FTP (ftp.netcom.com: /pub/johnl/
zines/e-zine-list); WWW (http//www.ora.com:8080/johnl/e-zine-list/).

  FITZ'S SHOPTALK: Daily dispatches on the TV business, both networks and

of wire-service and major newspapers, but also includes some full-text
reprints.
  How to get it: E-mail (shoptalk-request@gremlin.clark.net, SUBSCRIBE
YOUR@ADDRESS).

  LATE SHOW NEWS: A guy who obviously stays up way too late puts out a
weekly newsletter on the late-night talk show wars. It's biased toward
Letterman but contains surprisingly good industry dirt on Leno, Conan,
etc. (even for those of us writing about television for a living).
  How to get it: E-mail (listserv@mcs.net; SUBSCRIBE LATE-SHOW-NEWS
YOUR@ADDRESS), Usenet (alt.fan.letterman and rec.arts.tv), FTP
(ftp.mcs.net:/mcsnet.users/barnhart/letterman).

   +ARTNEWS: Synopsis of the print media's coverage of the art world,
collectors, museums, artists, art and government. Very promising, but

  SKYGUIDE: This monthly's from a Brit who doubtless watches too much TV.

also romps off onto the continent. (Did you know you can decrypt a
scrambled DBS signal with a PC? OMIGOD!)

thing is that they're all pretty high quality. Headline news from British
satellite newsletter Transponder
  How to get it: E-mail (editor@trponder.win-uk.net)

  CYBER-SLEAZE: Overhyped and a bit tedious, Cyber-Sleaze is composed of
low-grade gossip and put out by former MTV VJ Adam Curry. This address
may not be good for long (probably dying June 30, since Curry's being
sued by MTV for trademark infringement).
  How to get it: E-mail (csleaze@mtv.com)

 ---------------------------Infotech--------------------------------

life) became famous by getting sued for libel by a "make.money.fast"-type.
But will someone get this man a listerver?

  HOTT: HOTT  -- Hot Off The Tree -- has re-emerged as a giant pub
culling the latest advances in computer, communications, and electronics
technologies from over trade magazines, newspapers and net resources.
Great stuff, but why they're gathering so much material for a huge
monthly rather than a smaller weekly or something is beyond me.

of its format.

bi-weekly newsletter on medicine by Health Info-Com Network, put together

downside is conference announcements (OK, on things like techniques for
identifying corpses, but they're still conference announcements!).

  CHOICE-NET REPORT: This sort-of-weekly comes of the California Abortion
and Reproductive Rights Action League-North, culled from clips and
announcements. Pretty good stuff. So far, they've kept it very newsy (Who

  INFORMATION POLICY ONLINE: Counterprogramming the privacy advocates,
IPO come from the Information Industry Association and covers
legislation regarding government restriction on information. Too little

a welcome counterpoint to the net's generally one-sided privacy debates.

Subject: File 5--Request for Comments: U.S. Tech Corps

TO--All computer professionals
FROM--Gary Beach, Publisher, Computerworld
DATE--June 16, 1994
RE--U.S. Tech Corps

Computerworld, the national computer newspaper, is working with the
White House Office of Science and Technology to develop the U.S. Tech
Corps, a volunteer effort to aid local schools in technology
implementation.

As we develop this program, we are seeking comments from a variety
computer technologists, business leaders, and government officials.
Our overriding question is, "Will the 1.9 million U.S. computer
professionals respond to this effort?"

I hope you'll take a moment or two to read the following statement.
Then, send me your comments about how the U.S. Tech Corps can be made
to work for the future of our public schools.

Thanks very much.

Gary J. Beach
Publisher
Computerworld

Anyone who has written code, maintained a network, or planned a
company information system knows that implementation is everything.
Surprisingly, so do thousands of U.S. school teachers and
administrators.

Throughout the U.S., our schools say that a shortage of technical
talent is their largest obstacle in moving the "information
superhighway" from vision to reality. Their tight budgets and a dire
shortage of technical skills stand in the way of implementing
technology where it is most needed: the local classroom.

A solution may be in sight.

Computerworld, the national newspaper of information systems
management, is working jointly with the White House Office of Science
and Technology to develop the U.S. Tech Corp.

Modeled on the U.S. Peace Corps, the U.S. Tech Corps will rally the
talents and skills of more than 1.9 million computer professionals to
assist public schools in planning and implementing information
technology. Through contributions of their time and expertise, these
volunteers will play an integral and crucial role in building local
roads to the national information superhighway. Even an hour a week of
discussion and planning can help your local school.

The U.S. Tech Corps will be operated with assistance from the White
House, the National Education Association, and the National
Association of School Administrators. Volunteers will receive a U.S.
Tech Corps certificate signed by the President, as well as local
recognition. Of course, the greatest reward may be the satisfaction
gained from contributing your valuable skills to the future of our
school children.

[Action Items: What else is needed? Do you think that your fellow
computer professionals will respond favorably or unfavorably to this
proposal? How might the U.S. Tech Corp be made to work?]

I look forward to receiving your comments at ustech@cw.com.
