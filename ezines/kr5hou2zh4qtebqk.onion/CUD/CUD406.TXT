Subject: File 1--Bust of "NotSoHumble Babe" / USA

The recent busts of three persons in the Detroit and Los Angeles areas
for alleged carding, theft, software copyright violations and fraud
raise a number of issues of CU relevance. Because of misinformation
circulating on the nature of the case, we summarize what we know of it
below.  "Amy" (handle: "NotSoHumble Babe") was busted on her birthday,
and is not untypical of many CU types, so we focus on her.

1. "Amy" was busted on Jan 30, in Farmington Hills (Mi), by local,
    state, and federal agents. There were reportedly up to 20 agents.
    The large number was because there were several from each
    department, including the FBI, SecServ, Mi State police, and
    others. They reportedly showed no warrant, but knocked on the door
    and asked if they could come in. When "Amy" said "yes," they burst
    (rather than calmly entered) with weapons, including
    "semi-automatics." Her boyfriend was reportedly asleep, and the
    agents awakened him with a gun to his head.  The agent in charge
    was Tony Alvarez of the Detroit SecServ.

2. There has been no indictment, but the agents indicated that charges
   would include theft, fraud, and copyright violations.  (software
   piracy and carding). The initial figure given was a combined $20,00
   for the three ("Amy," "Tom," and Mike").

3. All equipment was confiscated, included "every scrap of paper in
   the house. She was informed that, whatever the outcome of the case,
   she would not receive the equipment back and that it would be kept
   for "internal use."

The above account differs dramatically from one given by "anonymous"
in "Phantasy #6," which was a diatribe against the three for
"ratting." However, the above account seems fairly reliable, judging
from a news account and a source close to the incident.

"Amy" is 27, and reported to be the head of USA (United Software
Alliance), which  is considered by some to be the current top
"cracking" group in the country. If memory serves, "ENTERPRISE BBS"
was the USA homeboard.  She was questioned for about 10 hours, and
"cooperated." She has, as of Saturday (Feb 9) *not* yet talked to an
attorney, although she was put in contact with one late Saturday. The
prosecutor in Oakland County is the same one who is prosecuting Dr.
Kavorkian (of "suicide machine" fame). He has a reputation as
excessively harsh, and his demeanor in television interviews does not
contradict this.

The other two defendants, "Mike/The Grim Reaper," and "Tom/Genesis"
are from the Detroit and Los Angeles areas.

What are the issues relevant for us?

My own radiclib concern is with over-criminalization created by
imposing a label onto a variety of disparate behaviors and then
invoking the full weight of the system against the label instead of
the behaviors. It is fully possible to oppose the behaviors while
recognizing that the current method of labelling, processing, and
punishment may not be wise. Len Rose provides an example of how
unacceptable but relatively benign behaviors lead to excessive
punishment. This, however, is a broader social issue of which
computer-related crimes is simply a symptom.

Of more direct relevance:

1) It appears that the continued use of massive force and weaponry
   continues. We've discussed this before in alluding to cases in New
   York, Illinois, Texas, and California. The video tape of the bust
   of the "Hollywood Hacker" resembles a Miami Vice episode: A
   middle-aged guy is confronted with an army of yelling weapons with
   guns drawn charging through the door.  Others on the board have
   reported incidences of being met with a shotgun while stepping out
   of the shower, a gun to the head while in bed, and (my favorite) a
   15 year old kid busted while working on his computer and the
   agent-in-charge put her gun to his head and reportedly said, "touch
   that keyboard and die." The use of such force in this type of bust
   is simply unacceptable because of the potential danger (especially
   in multi-jurisdictional busts, which reduces the precision of
   coordination) of accidental violence.

2.  Until indictments and supporting evidence are made public, we
    cannot be sure what the occured. But, it seems clear that, for
    "Amy" at least, we are not dealing with a major felon.  Carding is
    obviously wrong, but I doubt that, in situations such as this,
    heavy-duty felony charges are required to "teach a lesson," "set
    an example," and re-channel behavior into more productive outlets.

 3. We can continue to debate the legal and ethical implications of
    software piracy. There is a continuum from useful and fully
    justifiable "creative sharing" to heavy-duty predatory rip-off for
    profit. This case seems to be the former rather than the latter.
    There is no sound reason for treating extreme cases alike.

3. We should all be concerned about how LE frames and dramatizes such
   cases for public consumption. The Farmington newspaper gave it
   major coverage as a national crime of immense proportions. We
   should all be concerned about how piracy cases are handled, because
   even extreme cases have implications for minor ones. Does
   possession of an unauthorized copy of Aldus Pagemaker and Harvard
   Graphics, collective worth more than $1,000, really constitute a
   major "theft"? We have seen from the cases of Len and Craig how
   evaluation of a product is inflated to justify indictments that
   look serious but in fact are not.

I'm not sure what purpose it serves to simply assert that people--even
if guilty of carding or piracy--should "get what's coming to them"
without reflecting on what it is they get and why.  The issue isn't
one of coddling or protecting "criminals," but to examine more
carefully what kinds of computer-related crimes should be
criminalized, which should be torts, and which should be accepted as
minor nuisances and--if not ignored--at least not criminalized.

To give the dead horse one last kick: I am not arguing that we condone
behaviors. I am only suggesting that we reflect more carefully on how
we respond to such behaviors. I do not know the circumstances of "Tom"
and "Mike," but "Amy's" case raises many issues we can address without
condoning the behavior.

    (74 lines)  SPA: Jackboot Fascists or Keystone Kops?
               (C) 1992 by Michael E. Marotta

    Suddenly the doors burst open! US marshals take the Acme Inc.,
    employees by surprise!! "Nobody move! Keep your hands away from
    those keyboards!" yells the copper.  "Oh my gosh! It's the SPA!!"
    "Quick stash the disks!!"  This 50s cartoon is the cover story of
    the June 17, 1991 issue of Information Week, "The Software
    Police."  Inside is the story of the Software Publishers Associa-
    tion. There is nothing laughable about the $90,000 paid to SPA by
    IPL, the $100,000 paid by Entrix, the $17,500 paid by Healthline,
    the $350,000 paid by Parametrix. At SnapOn Tools, three US
    Marshals and an SPAer spent two days going through every one of
    280 PCs with their special audit package. Then the burden of proof
    shifted to SnapOn to produce purchase orders, manuals, invoices
    and asset tags.

    "GOVERN-MENTALITY"    The SPA claims a staff of 18 to 23 and a
    budget of $3.8 million. I had to call three times to get the free
    audit program, SPAudit.  They also offer to sell a video "It's
    Just Not Worth the Risk" for $10 but my three voicemail requests
    (Nov, Dec 91 & Jan 92) for this tape were not answered.
      +  People with govern-mentality are below norm and the program
    SP+Audit underscores this fact.
      +  First of all, the README file was created with WordPerfect 5.
    Using LIST or TYPE gets you ascii garbage and uneven formating
    am+id the text.  If you want to view the README file, the
    instructions tell you:
      +       A) To display on screen type TYPE A:README:MORE
    which is bad documentation and doesn't work.  Hardcopy reveals the
    same problems and when you get to the bottom of the page, you find
    that the last few lines print over each other.  Apparently, the
    typist used the cursor keys to position the text, because it lacks
    some necessary LFs (ascii 0A).
      +  I created four dummy files 123.EXE, MSDOS.SYS, PROCOMM.EXE and
    SK+.COM which are found in the PIF.TXT file of over 600 software
    names.  The files I created said:
    "The problem of copyright looks somewhat different the moment one
    accepts copying technology as uncontrollable." Michael Crichton.
      +  Then I made more copies at lower directory levels.  SPAudit
    was indeed able to search down eight directory sublevels to find
    copies. However, when I went to print these, the program produced
    ascii garbage.  It failed on
    C:+\123\MIKE\ANOTHER\DEEPER\NEMO\PLUTO\CHIRON\DANTE\ORPHEUS being
    unable to print beyond \NEMO.
      +  Overall, the SPA proves itself unable to manage PC technology.
    This lack of quality is not surprising.  No matter how much you
    pay for software, you know that the seller "makes no claim of
    merchantability or fitness for a particular use..." and won't be
    liable for "direct, indirect, special, incidental or consequential
    damages arising out of the use or inability to use the software or
    documentation."  That is the disclaimer which comes with SPAudit.
      +
    "CATCH-22"    Following SPAudit guidelines means that you can't
    have more than one copy of a program on one computer.  Also, all
    oF the CARMEN SANDIEGO games run from CARMEN.EXE.  The audit
    thinks it is looking for EUROPE but will also trip on WORLD, and
    TI+ME, etc., meaning that you can get busted for buying more than
    one CARMEN, a catch-22.
      +  Also, there should be some confusion over dBase, which is no
    longer an Ashton-Tate but a Borland product.  More importantly, US
    District judge Terrence Hatter, Jr., ruled in late 1990 that the
    copyright on dBase was voided by their not revealing that it is a
    cl+one of a public domain program from JPL.
      +  Again, consider the case of SnapOn Tools. The SPA used their
    defective software to disrupt a business for two days -- and they
    have the nerve to call other people pirates.

Subject: File 3--Fine for "Logic Bomber"

"Logic Bomb Programmer Fined"
(Reprinted with permission from STReport 8.04  Jan 24, 1992)

 Michael John Lauffenburger, a 31-year-old programmer formerly with
 General Dynamics, pleaded guilty Nov. 4 to attempted computer
 tampering.  He has been fined $5,000, handed three years' probation
 and was ordered to perform 200 hours of community service for
 attempting to sabotage computers with a "logic bomb" that prosecutors
 say could have erased national security data.

 According to reports, Lauffenburger set up the logic bomb, then
 resigned, intending to get hired on as high-priced consultant to help
 reconstruct the data lost from the billion-dollar Atlas Missile Space
 Program when the virus was unleashed.  A co-worker accidentally
 discovered the rogue program in early May. It had been set to go off
 May 24. Investigators said at the time the bomb would have caused
 about $100,000 in damage to computer systems at the Kearny Mesa
 plant.

Subject: File 4--Re: Newsbytes on the Oregon BBS Rates Case

On 2-5-92, reporter Dana Blankenhorn released a copyrighted exclusive
story for Wendy Wood's Newsbytes covering the Oregon BBS rates case.
What follows is an abstract of that story.

Blankenhorn writes: "US West has launched a campaign before the Oregon
Public Utility Commission which would force all bulletin board systems
(BBSs) in that state to pay business rates on their phone lines." The
Newsbytes exclusive also asserts that US West "wants the Oregon PUC to
reinterpret its tariff so as to define any phone not answered by a
human voice as a business line."

Blankenhorn quotes extensively from an apparent interview with SysOp
Stewart Anthony Wagner while summarizing the chronology of events in
the case. Some folks here might find the chronology and alleged facts
be a bit different from what has been reported in the past.

According to Blankenhorn, Portland, Oregon SysOp Tony Wagner attempted
to subscribe to extra phone lines so as to expand his BBS from 2 lines
to 4, as well as make arrangements for a TDD. It was at this point
Wagner was informed he would have to pay business rates on all lines
by US West. According to Blankenhorn, US West relented on the voice
and TDD lines while maintaining that the BBS lines would have to be
classified as business lines. Wagner filed what Blankenhorn calls an
"appeal" at the Oregon PUC "for the BBS".

Wagner is reported to have closed his BBS almost immediately because
he "can't afford it" at business rates, which blankenhorn states to be
around $50 (presumably per month) on each line. Before closing his
system, Wagner says he alerted regional SysOps via FidoNet to his
plight.  Wagner points out that some SysOps chipped in to pay for a
lawyer. Blankenhorn quotes Wagner on a so-called "compromise proposal"
that "they (US West) come up with a residential data line rate, as an
alternate form of service." Wagner's proposal apparently included a
guarantee of data quality at a rate that Wagner seems to assess at
$5.00 above standard residential rates. Wagner asserts the proposal
was rejected.

Wagner's comments on the hearing display optimism as he offers the
thought that "the hearing went quite well.  The tariff says a
residential line is for social or domestic purpose. They ignored the
social, they talked only about domestic. The BBS is as social as you
can get."

In a series of quotes from Wagner on what he believes US West is
doing, a grim picture is painted for more than BBS operators. For
example: Wagner states "there is no question they want to apply this
to all SysOps. Their position is that if it's not answered by a human
voice, it's a business. A fax machine is a business, to them. So's an
answering machine."

Wagner spoke of what he might consider a silver lining in his cloudy
future as a SysOp when he told Blankenhorn that publicity must be bad
for US West. He reinforces this idea by noting "one thing that hurt
them (US West) badly was that they picked on me. I'm very hard of
hearing. Most of my users are disabled. A large percentage of our
SysOps here are disabled. And Mr. Holmes (US West's attorney in the
Wagner case) was unprepared for that."

Blankenhorn talked with Judith Legg in the hearings section at the
Oregon Public Utility Commission concerning the Wagner Case. He
reports Legg told him "a hearing was held on the case in January, and
US West has already submitted a 17-page brief supporting its
position." Hearings Officer Simon Fitch was attributed as informing
Newsbytes that Wagner "has until March 3 to file his own brief, after
which reply briefs will be sought from both sides." Fitch is also
reported to have said a decision in the case is due in late March or
early April with final oversight from the Commissioners.

Attempts, by Blankenhorn, to contact attorney Steven Holmes at US West
were unsuccessful. Apparently, no one else in the company was
available for comment. Thus, the Newsbytes article contained no
synopsis of US West's side of the issues in the Wagner case.
Blankenhorn left the door open to a future update by noting
information requested from US West would be reported as soon as that
information is made available to Newsbytes.

So much for the abstract...

A FEW OBSERVATIONS: It seems that Blankenhorn must not have been able
to obtain a copy of US West's brief before going to press. Otherwise,
Blankenhorn would realize, and could have noted, that US West's
comments have no impact on FAX or answering machines. BBS operation in
general, and Wagner's BBS in specific, are the myopic focus of the
brief. Blankenhorn also could have asked about and cleared up what
appears to be a discrepancy between Wagner's apparent indication that
he was running his BBS on 2 phone lines at the time he requested new
lines, and the repeated references in the US West brief to Wagner's
"3" BBS phone lines. Finally, I called Judith Legg myself on 2-6-92
and asked her about the actual timing of the hearing. She informed me
that the hearing was indeed in December. In Blankenhorn's defense,
Legg admits that she was under the mistaken impression that the
hearing took place in January, and that this is probably what she told
Blankenhorn. A check of the Oregon PUC's computerized schedules was
necessary to clarify the actual hearing date.

Subject: File 5--Calif. "Privacy [& Computer Crime] Act of 1992"

 The Chair of the California State Senate, Bill Lockyer, is
 introducing what he calls "The Privacy Act of 1992."  It addresses
 computer *crime* in a robust manner, but appears to be less concerned
 with some of the more major privacy issues (e.g. personal
 data/profiles built & used by government and private corporations)
 posed during public testimony in December.  I scanned it in, OCRed
 it, proofed it, and believe this is an accurate copy of the original
 cover letter and content.  The latter has already been sent to
 Legislative Counsel (on 1/8/92).

 Please upload it and circulate it to all others who might be
 interested.  Note:  Many consider that computer legislation at the
 state level in major, "bellweather" states may/can/will provide
 models for other states and for eventual federal legislation.  Thus,
 this deserves *early* and widespread circulation, review and *public
 comment*.

        ====== TEXT OF COVER-LETTER, RECEIVED JAN. 17, 1992 =====

                     California State Senate
          Bill Lockyer, Tenth [California] Senatorial District
         [Chairman, California State Senate Judiciary Committee]

 January 15, 1992

 TO: Interested Parties

 FROM: Ben Firschein, Senator Lockyer's Office

 RE: Privacy legislation emerging from the interim hearing

 We have drafted language reflecting some of the suggestions made at
 the privacy hearing on December 10 [1991] and have sent it to
 Legislative Counsel.  It is likely that Senator Lockyer will
 introduce the language as a bill when it comes back from Legislative
 Counsel.

  We welcome and encourage your suggestions, comments and proposed
 amendments.  This language should be viewed as an initial proposal,
 and it is likely that it will be amended as it proceeds through the
 legislature.

  The bill as submitted to Legislative Counsel does the following:

   1. Information obtained from driver's licenses: prohibit businesses
 from selling or using for advertising purposes information obtained
 from driver's licenses without the written consent of the consumer.

   2. Automatic vehicle identification [AVI]: Require Caltrans to
 provide an opportunity to pre-pay tolls and use the facility
 anonymously.

   3. Violation of privacy of employees: language has been drafted
 based on the Connecticut statute that Justice Grodin discussed at the
 hearing. The proposed language goes further than the Connecticut
 statute in that it also extends to prospective employees.

   4. Amend Penal Code Section 502 (computer crime statute) as
follows:

      a) Extend existing law to allow recovery by any injured party,
 not just the owner or lessee of the computer.

      b) Allow recovery for any consequential or incidental damages,
 not just for expenditures necessary to verify that a computer system
 was or was not damaged.

     c) Create civil penalty of $ 10,000 per injured party up to a
 maximum of fifty thousand dollars for recklessly storing data in a
 manner which enables a person to commit acts leading to a felony
 conviction.  Failure to report to law enforcement a previous
 violation under the statute would be deemed to be possible evidence
 of recklessness

     d) Require that owner or lessee of computer report to law
 enforcement any known violations of the statute involving his/her
 system.   Such reports required within 60 days after they become
 known to owner or lessee.

 Warrants for electronically stored materials: We are interested in
 working with interested parties on some of the proposals made at the
 hearing, for possible inclusion in the bill as amendments.

               ====== END OF LEGISLATION DRAFT ======

 [Note:  The preceeding is the end-result of the draft-text.  Some of the
 document had apparently-old wording with strike-thru lines; some of it was
 underlined, apparently indicating newly-added wording.  Since there is no
 universally-accepted protocol for representing such "exotic" text-forms in
 the Barren ASCII Wasteland, the preceeding text does not reflect strike-thrus
 not underlines in the original text.  Also, the preceeding reflects
 the paragraph-indenting and paranthesized section-labeling, as
 received.  It is left as "an exercise for the reader" to figure out
 its rationale.

 The vast majority of us would readily state that we, personally,
 "store and maintain data."  To the extent that we do so on a shared
 host, it seems like it could be applied to us, *as individuals*.
 Unless, perhaps, we stored it in encrypted form or made other
 provable efforts to protect it while it's stored on a shared system.

 Please note that this scenario equally applies to folks working on
 LAN systems at a company.

 Is this, perhaps, "overly-broad legislation"?

Subject: File 6--DIAC-92 Workshop Call for Paraticipation and Workshop Guideline
s
              Directions and Implications of Advanced Computing

                                 DIAC-92

                   Berkeley, California      May 3, 1992

                      Call for Workshop Proposals and

                       Workshop Proposal Guidelines

                            [Due Date Extended]


DIAC-92 is a two-day symposium in which the the social implications of
computing are explored.  The first day (May 2, 1992) will consist of
presentations.  The second day will consist of a wide variety of
workshops.  These guidelines describe the intent for the workshops and the
manner in which they are proposed.  They are meant to augment and
supercede the information found in the Call for Papers and Participation.
The workshops are meant to be more informal than the presented papers of
the previous day.  For this reason the format for the proposals is
expected to vary.  Nevertheless there are some guidelines that we can
offer that will help ensure a succesful workshop.

The proposal should include the title, author's name, affiliation, and
electronic mail address at the beginning. All workshop proposals will be
included in the proceedings.  The workshop proposal should be 1 - 8 pages
in length.  The desired range of attendees (smallest number - largest
number) should be included.  All workshops will be two hours in length with
a short break 1/2 way through.  It is possible to schedule two related
workshops back to back, say "Introduction to Something" and "Advanced
Something".  If this is the case please submit two separate proposals but
state that they are related.

There are four major concerns for the workshops which should be
addressed in the proposal.

1. Intellectual Content
   The intellectual content of the workshop should be made clear.
   What is the focus on the workshop?  What are the relevant social
   issues? What relevant research exists already on the topic?  Who
   is the intended audience?  The topic should have a qualitative
   computing element in it.

2. Structure
   There should be some structure to the workshop.  It can be quite
   loose and flexible but it shouldn't be completely open.  The
   amount of structure will vary according to the topic at hand, the
   intended goals, the personalities of the audience and the organizers,
   etc. The proposal should describe the structure of the
   workshop.

3. Interactivity
   The workshop should be interactive.  The workshop should be
   designed in such a way to promote meaningful interaction between
   the organizer or organizers and the attendees.  Because there is
   group interaction it is hoped that more points will be raised,
   more issues considered, and deeper analysis performed.  The
   methods of interaction should be described in the proposal.

4. Product or action oriented
   Ideally the workshop should result in some product or plan for
   action.  Although this aspect is not critical, the program
   committee feels that this is quite important and we hope that
   workshop organizers will think in these terms and strive to
   promote an appropriate outcome.  Possible "deliverables" are
   described below.


               Possible Output From a DIAC-92 Workshop

  + Statements or press releases
  + Bibliography on subject matter
  + Electronic distribution list on the subject
  + Ideas for a follow up meeting, workshop, or conference
  + List of possible projects on the subject
  + Writeup of meeting for electronic or print dissemination
  + A project proposal
  + A panel discussion proposal
  + A grant proposal
  + An experiment
  + A working agreement -- e.g. to connect two networks, to share
    data,  to  begin  a study, to write an article, to build software
    jointly, etc.
  + A videotape of some or all of a workshop
  + A brainstormed list of viewpoints, a "semantic network" of  the
    issues
  + A list of hypotheses
  + Any plan to continue discussion on the topic

Please send proposal (four copies) to Doug Schuler, 2202 N. 41st St,
Seattle, WA, 98103.   Proposals are due by March 1, 1992.  Proposals
will be reviewed by the program committee.  Acceptance or rejection
notices will be mailed by April 1, 1992.  We plan to incorporate
workshop proposals into the proceedings.  Please contact us if you
have any questions or comments.
