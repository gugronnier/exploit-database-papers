Computer and system literacy improves our ability to send and receive
information across systems and to identity and resolve problems on our own
systems when they occur. We encourage people to submit "tricks and traps"
that others might find useful in their jobs or in simply becoming more
functionally adept on their system.

The following description of SMTP was submitted by The Parrot.

A quick SMTP tutorial.

SMTP or simple mail transfer protocol is the method used by most internet
hosts to handle the transfer of mail across the internet. It is a wonderfully
simple system that handles everything in the easiest method possible. All
commands and text are transfered as text, so SMTP is easy to debug. The SMTP
port, which is listed in the services file in the etc directory, can be
connected to using known protocols such as tcp/ip. For debugging purposes, it
can be connected to using telnet. (eg. telnet host #of_smtp_port)

The commands are all text, and are listed, on request, by the SMTP server on the
remote machine. The main ones are: %comments are in curly braces%

Mail From: sender@host.net.domain.area	%regular internet address%
RCPT To: recipient@host.net.domain.area
Data                                    %to start typing text%

%body of message here... for format see RFC #822%
%from the RFC INDEX... %
%822   Crocker, D.  Standard for the format of ARPA Internet text messages.
%     1982 August 13; 47 p. (Format: TXT=109200 bytes)  (Obsoletes RFC 733;
% or look at an old mail message%

.   %finish message with a period%

quit %to quit from connection%

Send mail is not intended as a user interface and should not be used as one.
One of the many mailers available (Elm, bin mail, mm, etc.) all offer an easy
interface between the user and SMTP.
