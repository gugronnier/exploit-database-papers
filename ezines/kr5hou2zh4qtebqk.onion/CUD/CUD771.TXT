Hello CyberFolks,

Wednesday, August 16th BayFF (Bay Area Chapter of EFF) held a meeting in
San Francisco with speakers Mike Godwin and Cliff Stoll. Attached are a
few notes for those of you who missed the opportunity to attend.

Wednesday, August 16, 1995, I found myself cruising through Golden Gate
Park. Suddenly I swerved into the right lane and shouted "Eureka." For
those who don't know, Eureka is the California state motto which, in the
tradition of the Gold Rush, means "I found it!" In San Francisco IT means
a parking place. Feeling euphoric about my good fortune, I started the
short walk long on memories towards the Haight-Ashbury district. It was
delightful and fogless. The salty air was cool. The smell of grass (the
type that city gardener's mow) was fresh. Passing a guitarist, I thought
of the Grateful Dead's Jerry Garcia, recently deceased. My mind flashed
back twenty-five years ago when I first visited Haight-Ashbury. Twenty-
five years ago at the dawn of the Computer Age... So many silicon chips
under the bridge... I thought of all the people in the Haight mourning
Garcia and donating to the Haight-Ashbury Free Clinic in Garcia's memory.
I flashed back upon my first meeting with John Perry Barlow, lyricist for
the Grateful Dead and co-founder of EFF. That meeting helped inspire me
to write COMPUTER PRIVACY HANDBOOK. Such were a few of the images that
danced through my mind as I entered the Cole & Page Street Public
Library... It was appropriate to be attending an EFF meeting.

John Gilmore, EFF Board Member, was the first person I saw. Gilmore
reminds me of a lean Chesire cat. He has a mischievous smile as if to
say, "You won't believe what just happened." Maybe we'll never discover
what just happened with John, since he's so much into crypto. In any
case, Gilmore introduced Mike Godwin as "The first lawyer in Cyberspace
and EFF's first employee."

Mike Godwin ("a cool guy who survived law school with his personality
intact" according to an anonymous EFF publicist) spoke for 90 minutes
about how to deal with reporters and, more specifically, about his role
in trying to correct the damage done to cyberspace by TIME's infamous
"CyberPorn" cover story. Godwin detailed many flaws in Carnegie Mellon
University undergraduate Mr. Rimm's study of cyberporn that led to the
"CyberPorn" piece. Godwin said of Rimm's paper: "It's as if you surveyed
the bookstores in Times Square in Manhattan and generalized to all
bookstores in America."

Cliff Stoll ("a wild and crazy guy with interesting hair" according to
the same anonymous EFF publicist) is the author of the best-selling book
SILICON SNAKE OIL. Stoll personifies the eccentric heritage of the San
Francisco counter-culture. With lots of humor and drama, Stoll presented
a critical view of the Internet. "The Internet is a perfect diversion
from learning" and "The Internet opens many doors that lead to empty
rooms" were two of his many memorable lines. Stoll noted that wisdom and
experience play little role in the Computer Cult (i.e., all the Hype
surrounding the Information Superhighway).

The EFF events that I've attended at WIRED's office in the San Francisco
Mission District and last night are well worth the hassle of hunting down
a parking place.

Subject: File 3----WebSite Wins Dvorak Award

O'REILLY & ASSOCIATES WINS PRESTIGIOUS DVORAK AWARD FOR EXCELLENCE

Sebastopol, CA, August 21, 1995 -- O'Reilly & Associates' WebSite (TM)
has received the prestigious 1995 John C. Dvorak Award for Excellence
in PC Telecommunications, it was announced at ONE BBSCON's annual
conference in Tampa, Florida on Saturday, August 19.

WebSite won the award for Outstanding Web Server Software, a new
category this year. More than 40,000 nominations for this year's
fourteen award categories were received by internationally known
writer John Dvorak and his committee.  WebSite is a 32-bit World Wide
Web server software package for Windows 95 and Windows NT which offers
an easy-to-use, completely graphical interface, from setup through
administration and Web building.

WebSite was developed collaboratively by O'Reilly & Associates,
independent developer Bob Denny, and a team at Enterprise Integration
Technologies (EIT) headed up by Jay Weber.

Tim O'Reilly, President of O'Reilly & Associates, expressed his pride
in receiving the award. "In many ways, this is an award to the
Internet's open systems philosophy.  The driving idea behind WebSite
was that the Internet has always been a peer-to-peer network. For the
Web to continue that tradition, everyone who has a Web browser ought
to have access to a Web server.  That belief set the standards for
price, availability and ease of use. What's more, the net brought
together the people who developed the product, connected them during
the development process, and provided the network of thousands of beta
testers who validated the product."

O'Reilly & Associates joins respected organizations and individuals
such as NCSA Mosaic, San Jose Mercury News, Delphi, America Online,
and Dennis Hayes (Hayes Microcomputer Products) which have received
Dvorak awards during the past four years. Historically, these awards
are presented to the individual and corporate pioneers in the
telecommunications industry whose vision and commitment have most
significantly contributed to the advancement of PC telecommunications
over the preceding twelve months.

Accepting the award for WebSite were Gina Blaber, Director of O'Reilly
& Associates' Software Products Group, Robert Denny, WebSite
developer, and Atul Arora, member of EIT development team. O'Reilly &
Associates is recognized worldwide for its definitive books on the
Internet and UNIX, and more recently for its development of online
content and software. Bob Denny created Win httpd, the 16-bit server
for Windows 3.1 which has been available on the net and widely praised
since early 1994. EIT, long-time developer of software tools for Web
server administration, also founded TERISA Systems, the leader in Web
security technology, and the CommerceNet Consortium, driving
deployment of Internet electronic commerce.

Subject: File 4----NIST Statement re "New" Crypto Policy

EMBARGOED FOR RELEASE:                  NIST 95-24
3 p.m. EDT, Thursday, Aug. 17, 1995

Contact:  Anne Enright Shepherd         COMMERCE'S NIST ANNOUNCES
          (301) 975-4858                PROCESS FOR DIALOGUE ON
                                        KEY ESCROW ISSUES

     Furthering the Administration's commitment to defining a
workable key escrow encryption strategy that would satisfy
government and be acceptable to business and private users of
cryptography, the Commerce Department's National Institute of
Standards and Technology announced today renewed dialogue on key
escrow issues.

     A Sept. 6-7 workshop will convene industry and government
officials to discuss key escrow issues, including proposed
liberalization of export control procedures for key escrow
software products with key lengths up to 64 bits, which would
benefit software manufacturers interested in building secure
encryption products that can be used both domestically and
abroad.

     Key escrow encryption is part of the Administration's
initiative to promote the use of strong techniques to protect the
privacy of data and voice transmissions by companies, government
agencies and others without compromising the government's ability
to carry out lawful wiretaps.

     In a July 1994 letter to former Rep. Maria Cantwell, Vice
President Gore said that the government would work on developing
exportable key escrow encryption systems that would allow escrow
agents outside the government, not rely on classified algorithms,
be implementable in hardware or software, and meet the needs of
industry as well as law enforcement and national security.  Since
that time, discussions with industry have provided valuable
guidance to the Administration in the development of this policy.
For example, many companies are interested in using a corporate
key escrow system to ensure reliable back-up access to encrypted
information, and the renewed commitment should foster the
development of such services.

     Consideration of additional implementations of key escrow
comes in response to concerns expressed by software industry
representatives that the Administration's key escrow policies did
not provide for a software implementation of key escrow and in
light of the needs of federal agencies for commercial encryption
products in hardware and software to protect unclassified
information on computer and data networks.

     Officials also announced a second workshop at which industry
is invited to help develop additional Federal Information
Processing Standards for key escrow encryption, specifically to
include software implementations.  This standards activity would
provide federal government agencies with wider choices among
approved key escrow encryption products using either hardware or
software.  Federal Information Processing Standards provide
guidance to agencies of the federal government in their
procurement and use of computer systems and equipment.

     Industry representatives and others interested in joining
this standards-development effort are invited to a key escrow
standards exploratory workshop on Sept. 15 in Gaithersburg, Md.
This workshop is an outgrowth of last year's meetings in which
government and industry officials discussed possible technical
approaches to software key escrow encryption.

     The Escrowed Encryption Standard, a Federal Information
Processing Standard for use by federal agencies and available for
use by others, specifies use of a Key Escrow chip (once referred
to as "Clipper chip") to provide strong encryption protection for
sensitive but unclassified voice, fax and modem communications
over telephone lines.  Currently, this hardware-based standard is
the only FIPS-approved key escrow technique.  NIST officials
anticipate proposing a revision to the Escrowed Encryption
Standard to allow it to cover electronic data transmitted over
computer networks.  Under this revised federal standard, the
Capstone chip and other hardware-based key escrow techniques
developed for use in protecting such electronic data also will be
approved for use by federal agencies.

     As a non-regulatory agency of the Commerce Department's
Technology Administration, NIST promotes U.S. economic growth by
working with industry to develop and apply technology,
measurements and standards.

                  Howling (In The Wires) Wolf
                  aka K.K. Burnett

Last week, I penetrated the Eglinton Rd. event horizon and spent six
days on Georgian Bay. Among many astonishing adventures, I found our
dog -- a puppy we got from the River St. Humane Society in '87 -- is
actually a German shepherd-otter crossbreed.

What the FAQ has this to do with the net?

Well, not only were there no computers up there, there weren't even
phones. Even if I'd had a laptop, I couldn't have jacked into the net.
I purposely only took one slim book.

Cold Turkey from email and netnews...

And it was glorious.

Which brings us to Cliff Stoll's new book, _Silicon Snake Oil: Second
Thoughts On The Information Highway_ (Doubleday, $29.95 cloth). It's a
reaction to the Info Shock phenomenon typical among netters. A call to
unplug, if only for a while, for a fresher perspective. Cliff lights a
match to the Star-Spangled Info Highway rhetoric about democracy and
"giving the homeless laptops."

You might recall Stoll as author of the (now classic) non-fiction
computer-espionage thriller _The Cuckoo's Egg_ -- buy it, consume it.
In that '89 book, Stoll writes about snaring an unknown intruder who
slid into his UNIX network at California's Lawrence Livermore research
labs. A Hanover hacker netted from a University of Bremen computer to a
German Datex-P network, then via satellite link to a defence contractor
computer in McClean, Va., where he used a Tymnet switching system to
enter Stoll's Berkeley machine, which was on the Arpanet/Milnet (U.S.
military nets). He then hit maybe 400 military computers. The book
pisses all over _WarGames_, that homage to the Disney-esque hacker.

So after a literary hiatus -- and scads of convention appearances --
Cliff's back. And he's cranky, dammit.

Stoll's out to broadside anything that twitches in cyberspace. He's
collected all the hype and rebuts it relentlessly. But don't be fooled.
Stoll's not really trashing cyberspace. Behind the pages of
(well-deserved) jibes at (what passes for) overt net.culture, Cliff
remains right on-board. Wouldn't surprise me to see him flogging IBM
wares as a "net.spokesperson" in a year or three.

He's never been your "typical" anything. He's sort of a leftover
hippie, without the anti-tech hard-on -- an astronomer by education,
hacker by inclination. His ideal weekend: staring at stars, consuming
homemade cookies and shakes and sleeping beside his UNIX system. He's
kinda what you'd get if Scotty were fucked up on Saurian Brandy (that
blue swill) and beamed Albert Einstein, Pauly Shore and Phiber Optik
aboard as a single person.

In _Silicon Snake Oil_, Stoll remains unpretentiously charming. It's
far more meandering and anecdotal. Travel with teenage Cliff as he
spelunks. Follow an acquaintance who scoots around abandoned tracks in
a little hand-built railcar.

The result: a book as readable as the first, but far less important.
It's more like Uncle Cliffy rocking on the cottage porch, sharing some
homespun phee-los-oh-phee, whilst drawing on his pipe and scanning the
lake. Not surprisingly you end up with some simplistic social theory --
like suggesting a kid's use of the net is what alienates him from his
family: "Kids that interact with computers rather than their parents
miss out on the most important part of growing: being close to their
families."

He's rather confusing cause and effect.

But it's enjoyable. I finished it over a weekend.

              *.GENERAL HOSPITAL

During lunch the following Tuesday I speed-scanned the tube. The remote
came to a screeching stop. I asked myself: "Did I just see some
zany-haired guy who looked like Cliff Stoll playing with a yo-yo on
TV?" I threw the remote into reverse and crawled back maybe 10
channels.

I answered myself: "Yes. Yes, you did. You did see some zany-haired guy
who looks like Cliff Stoll playing with a yo-yo on TV."

It _was_ Cliff. On CITY-TV's _LunchTelevision_. Book promo tour. The
host held the book. Cliff held a yo-yo. And he was trying to make that
baby sing.

"Shit, Cliff," I muttered, fumbling for volume. "Are you suggesting to
these yahoos that yo-yos are one of the lost pleasures human beings
would rediscover if they disconnected?"

Yo-yos and antics like hiding behind TV monitors aside, Cliff did make
one solid point about keeping citizens docile in an Info Society:
overload them.

"The way to control people's thoughts is not to lock them out of
information, but feed them a steady diet of dross."

It's a tactic familiar to journalists: government and business bury
critical data in a sea of sludge. As info is becoming "cheaper" all the
time, the general public can now share the same wonderous experience by
reading Usenet newsgroups -- especially unmoderated, ill-defined
newsgroups.

"The quality of information drops yearly -- the quantity goes up,"

Stoll notes.

He's hardly the first to notice this. As one netter wrote me in email:

"Every so often I feel this compulsion to bail on all the local

newsgroups [like tor.* and ont.*] due to their somewhat soap-opera-ish

nature.... However, if I did, I'd be depriving myself of a nightly

chuckle. Do ya think all the local groups all over the world are as

resplendant with idiots as tor.general and ont.general are? You could

just subscribe to *.general, and probably have a bigger laugh than any

of the alt.* groups."

So listen to Uncle Cliff. Unsubscribe from wanker.general! Put down
that 2,700-page _Holy Precepts of UNIX Technobabble Revealed, 3rd
Initiate_!

Get out yer yo-yos!

Subject--Russian Hackers

From - Risks-Forum Digest  Monday 21 August 1995  Volume 17 : Issue 28

Court documents were unsealed on 18 Aug 1995 that implicated Russian
computer hackers in about 40 transfers totalling more than $10 million
from the Citibank electronic funds transfer system, between June and
October, 1994.  The hackers were caught as they were trying to move
$2.8M.  The bank indicated only $400,000 was actually transferred --
which at first reading would seem to contradict the $10 million
figure, except for the fact that Citibank noted that none of its
clients lost any money, and that all of the transfers were either
blocked or reversed.  Six people have been arrested.  24-year-old
Vladimir Levin (who worked for AOSaturn, a Russian software house, and
who is currently under arrest in London) apparently had figured out
how to get around or through the Citibank security system.  [Source:
