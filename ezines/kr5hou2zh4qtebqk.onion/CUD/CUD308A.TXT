Timing of CuD Issues
+++++++++++++++

In the last CuD, we indicated that there would be a longer time lag between
issues. Now, a few days later, comes the next issue.  We suddenly seem to
have a good bit of material ranging from special issues on
FOIA/Constitutional stuff to a few longer articles that will take the bulk
of an issue. Thanks to all the contributors, AND KEEP THE STUFF COMING. We
especially want blurbs from news papers (or summaries for longer stories
that assure no copyright protections are violated).

A number of recent mailings have bounced--nobody seems to know why. All
uucp addresses in the CuD 3.07 mailing, but this seems to have been fixed
for most addresses. Vacation seems to have resulted in other stuff being
returned. Best way to receive CuD is off the nets (alt.society.cu-digest)
or ftp (see header).

+++++++++++++++
CuD FTP Additions
+++++++++++++++

The CuD ftp sites currently include a variety of University computer
policies, additional papers, and a variety of state and federal (and a few
foreign) computer abuse statutes.

law/<state>	Current computer crime laws are online for:
		  AL, AK, AZ, CA, CO, CT, DE, FL, GA, HI, IA, ID, IL,
		  IN, MD, MN, NJ, NY, TX, VT, VA, and WV.

		(Everyone [law students especially] is encouraged to send
		 along other statutes...we want to build this area up to
		 [hopefully] a full set.)

		We still needed: AR, DC, KS, KY, ME, MI, MO, MS, MT, NC, ND,
			      NH, NM, NV, OK, RI, SC, SD, TN, UT, WI, WY

2600 and Full Disclosure Magazines
+++++++++++++++++

2600 and Full Disclosure are out. Characteristical, 2600 has its usual
collection of interesting articles, including a nice story on Republican
Party hacking into Democratic Party computers, "The Hacker Reading List,"
and one of the last articles to come out of the Legion of Doom, "Central
Office Operations" (by Agent Steal). As a number of people have observed
following increased exposure of the rip-off of COCOTS (Coin Operated,
Customer-Owned Telephones), 2600 was instrumental in documenting various
abuses in the past. It's a mag well worth the modest investment. Contact:
2600@well.sf.ca.us or write 2600 Magazine; PO Box 752; Middle Island, NY
11953 (USA).

We also received the latest issue of Full Disclosure (#22).  Articles
include a summary of the Ripco Seizure, the "Atlanta Three" Sentencing
Memorandum, and numerous articles on government surveillance.  It's a great
issue, and a steal for only $18 for 12 issues. Contact: Full DIsclosure,
Box 903-FD22, Libertyville, IL 60048. The Mag's Glen Roberts (publisher)
and Bill Vajk (professional gadfly), remember, are the ones who dug up the
Ripco seizure warrant when nobody else could.
