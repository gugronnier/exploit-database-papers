***  CuD #2.02, File 3 of 5: RIPCO BBS Back on-Line              ***
********************************************************************

Good news for computerists: **RIPCO BBS IS BACK UP**!!  Ripco went down on
May 8 in the Sun Devil raids, and Dr. Ripco's equipment, software, logs,
and even manuals for his software, were seized. He was apparently the only
victim of a "seizure warrant," *not just a search warrant*, which is
usually served *after* an arrest or indictment. Perhaps a lawyer could send
us the distinction and clarify the significance. Dr. Ripco has not been
indicted, and to our knowledge there is no evidence that he knowingly
participated in any illegal act on his board.  It is still unclear why his
board was targeted. Perhaps it was longevity (over six years), perhaps
because some of the users were nationally well known, or perhaps because of
the text file collection, which to our knowledge were all public
information.

The Doc met with representatives from EFF in late August and early
September. The meetings were informational and centered on the type of
files users posted, the nature of the messages, and other general
information to determine whether there are sufficient Constitutional issues
to warrant further steps.

Ripco's number is the same--(312)528-5020, and he is hoping that previous
users can upload the numerous g-philes lost in the confiscation.
