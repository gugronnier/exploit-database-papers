THE TIME IS NOW

      HELP SENATOR LEAHY STOP THE EXON COMMUNICATIONS DECENCY ACT

The Senate is expected to on vote the Communications Decency Act (CDA,
a.k.a. the Exon Bill) within the next three weeks.

The Communications Decency Act, in its current form, would severely
restrict your rights to freedom of speech and freedom of expression
online, and represents a grave threat to the very nature and existence
of the Internet as we know it today. Without your help now, the
Communications Decency Act will likely pass and the net may never be
the same again.

Although the CDA has been revised to limit the liability of online
service providers, it would still criminalize the transmission of any
content deemed "obscene, lewd, lacivious, filthy, or indecent,"
including the private communications between consenting adults. Even
worse, some conservative pro-censorship groups are working to amend the
CDA to make it even more restrictive.

Currently, Senator Exon is negotiating with pro-censorship groups and
commercial entities that would be affected by the CDA. The voices of
Internet users must be heard now. We need to demonstrate that we are a
political force to be reckoned with.

In an effort to preserve your rights in cyberspace, Senator Patrick
Leahy (D-VT) has introduced the only legislative alternative to the
Communications Decency Act.  Senator Leahy is willing to offer his bill
as a substitute for the CDA, but needs your support behind his
efforts.

Senator Leahy's legislation would commission a study to examine the
complex issues involved in protecting children from controversial
content while preserving the First Amendment, the privacy rights of
users, and the free flow of information in cyberspace.

 ------------------------------------------------------------------------

ANOTHER PETITION?

Yes.  With a strong showing of support from the net.community, Senator
Leahy can offer his bill as a substitute for the Communications Decency
Act when the Senate votes on the issue later this month.  Senator Leahy
needs and wants to demonstrate to his colleagues in the Senate that the
net.community is behind him in his efforts. We must rise to the task
and demonstrate that we will not sit idly by as our rights are
threatened.

Senator Leahy, a strong civil liberties advocate, has been the Senate's
most vocal critic of the Exon/Gorton Communications Decency Act, and
has taken a leading role in defending the rights and civil liberties of
Internet users.  Senator Leahy has taken a great political risk in
representing the interests of Internet users on Capitol Hill.  The time
has come for us to show our appreciation and our support for his
efforts.

The previous petition against the Communications Decency Act generated
over 108,000 signatures, and was instrumental in Senator Leahy's
decision to offer his alternative   As the Senate moves to vote on the
CDA, we must act quickly to ensure that our collective voice continues
to be heard.

 ------------------------------------------------------------------------

WHAT IS LEAHY PROPOSING?

Senator Leahy's bill, S. 714, would direct the Department of Justice
and the Department of Commerce to commence a 5 month study to examine:

* Current law enforcement authority to prosecute the distribution of
  pornography over computer networks;

* Whether any additional law or law enforcement resources are necessary;

* The availability of technological capabilities, consistent with the
  First Amendment and the free flow of information in Cyberspace, to
  protect children from accessing controversial commercial and non-
  commercial content;

* Ways to promote the development and deployment of such technologies.

After conducting the study, the Justice Department must report to Congress
on its findings, and, if necessary, recommend changes in current law.

Leahy's bill represents the only substantive legislative alternative to the
Communications Decency Act, and will buy important time to have a detailed
and rational discussion about the issues involved in protecting children
from controversial content, and avoid the rush to censorship which is
occurring now on the Senate Floor.

Without a strong show of support for Leahy's bill, the Communications
Decency Act is very likely to pass.

THE PETITION STATEMENT

We the undersigned users of the Internet are strongly opposed to the
"Communications Decency Act" (Title IV of S. 652), which is currently
pending before the Senate. This legislation will severely restrict our
rights to freedom of speech and privacy guaranteed under the
constitution.

Based on our Nation's longstanding history of protecting freedom of
speech, we believe that the Federal Government should have no role in
regulating the content of constitutionally protected speech on the
Internet.

We urge the Senate to halt consideration of the Communications Decency
Act and consider in its place S. 714, the "Child Protection, User
Empowerment, and Free Expression In Interactive Media Study Bill", an
alternative approach offered by Senator Patrick Leahy (D-VT).

 ------------------------------------------------------------------------

PETITION RATIONALE

We oppose the "Communications Decency Act", sponsored by Senators James
Exon (D-NE) and Slade Gorton (R-WA), for the following reasons:

* It criminalizes the transmission of constitutionally protected speech,
  including the private communications between consenting individuals;

* It would violate privacy rights by protecting system administrators
  who take steps to ensure that their networks are not being used to
  transmit prohibited content, even if those steps include reading all
  messages, in violation of the Electronic Communications Privacy Act
  (ECPA).

* It fails to account for the unique characteristics of interactive
  media, including the tremendous control users have over the content
  they or their children receive.

* It would give the Federal Communications Commission jurisdiction over
  online speech by giving the FCC authority to establish rules
  governing the distribution of content online;

The Internet and other interactive communications technologies offer a
unique opportunity for the free exchange of information and ideas, and
embody the very essence of our nation's democratic traditions of
openness, diversity and freedom of speech.

As users of these technologies, we know perhaps better than anyone that
there are other, less restrictive ways to protect children from
controversial materials while preserving the First Amendment and the
free flow of information.

Senator Leahy's bill provides an opportunity to address the issues
raised by the Communications Decency Act without restricting the free
speech and privacy rights of users.

Subject: File 2--ACLU's Analysis of Revised Exon

ACLU Cyber-Liberties Analysis:
Revised Exon Amendment
May 25, 1995
            ----------------------------------------------

The American Civil Liberties Union has previously expressed its strong
opposition to the "Communications Decency Act," introduced by Senator Exon as
S. 314 and adopted by the Senate Commerce Committee as an amendment to
the Telecommunications Competition and Deregulation Act of 1995.

Yesterday, we obtained a revised version of the Exon Amendment, which
was apparently written by members of Senator Exon's staff in
consultation with representatives of online service providers, the
Department of Justice, and pro-censorship lobbying groups.  The
following analysis presents the ACLU's objections to the revised draft
and clarifies the ACLU's continuing concern that the Exon amendment,
in its existing or revised form, violates both free speech and privacy
rights.

I. Interactive Cyberspace Must Not Be Constricted by Old Media Models

The most fundamental flaw of the revised Exon amendment is that it
still wrongly attempts to force the new interactive environment of
cyberspace and online services into the censorship straitjacket
foisted on old media.  In fact, the Exon amendment even uses as its
model the most restrictive of the old media.

This is wrong-headed policy. It is also a violation of the Free Speech
and Privacy guarantees of the Constitution and therefore
unconstitutional.

The Exon amendment would make the interactive environment one of the
most censored segments of communications media when logic dictates
that cyberspace, with its emphasis on user-choice and user-control,
should make it the least censored.  At a minimum, the extremely
limited rules of content-regulation for print media, and the
safeguards against censorship for print materials, should be applied
to online communications.  The ACLU, moreover, believes that the
characteristics of cyberspace, including the private and interactive
nature of the communication, dictates that cyberspace should be even
more free than print.

We stress that there is no revision of the Exon amendment -- no
tinkering of its censorship provisions -- that eliminates this
problem.  The Exon amendment cannot be "fixed."  It must be rejected.

II.  The Exon Amendment Would Still Restrict Online Communications to
Those Appropriate for Children

Section (d) of the revised Exon amendment would still
unconstitutionally restrict all online content to that which is
suitable for children.

Even under existing case law, non-obscene speech that is deemed
"indecent" is protected by the First Amendment.  _Sable Communications
v. FCC_, 492 U.S. 115 (1989).  The Government may only regulate
indecent speech if it establishes a compelling governmental interest
in the regulation AND narrowly tailors the restriction to achieve that
interest.  _Id._ at 125.  See also _Pacifica Foundation v. FCC_, 438
U.S. 726 (1978); _Carlin Communications v.  FCC_, 749 F.2d 113 (2d
Cir. 1984) (Carlin I); _Carlin Communications v. FCC_, 787 F.2d 846
(2d Cir. 1986) (Carlin II); _Dial Information Services v.  Thornburg_,
938 F.2d 1535 (2d Cir. 1991).

Indeed, much of what consenting adults prize about some of their
personal communications could well be deemed by outsiders as
"indecent" if addressed to a child.

The revised draft, like the original Exon amendment, is
unconstitutional because requiring users and content providers to
reduce their content to what is suitable for children is not the least
restrictive means for protecting minors from indecent material.  The
"justifications" for regulation of indecency in broadcasting and
telephone audiotext services do not apply to interactive
communications, in which users - including parents - have much more
control over the content of the messages they receive.  We are also
prepared to argue that the "justifications" asserted for censorship in
any of the old media, including print, do not apply to cyberspace.

III. Some Specific Problems in the Revised Exon Draft

Again, the ACLU strongly believes that the anti-cyberliberty Exon
amendment cannot be "fixed."  It needs to be defeated.  So, even if
all of these specific problems were solved, the Exon amendment would
still be a terrible idea.  Still, it may be useful to consider briefly
some of the specific problems in the revised Exon draft.

     *Revised section (d) outlaws the online transmission of obscene
materials without defining "obscenity."  Using the test for obscenity
articulated in Miller v. California, 413 U.S. 1 (1973), the federal
government has chosen to stage prosecutions of online obscenity cases
in conservative jurisdictions in order to take advantage of more
restrictive "community standards."  See Thomas v. United States, U.S.
Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit, No. 94-6648 and No. 94-6649.
This trend poses a severe threat that online users and providers will
be forced to reduce content to that which would be acceptable under
the "community standards" of the most conservative jurisdiction.  The
ACLU has filed an amicus brief in the Thomas case strongly opposing
the government's misuse of the censorship laws.

     *Revised sections (d) and (e) extend liability for transmission
of obscene or indecent communications to non-commercial in addition to
commercial providers.  This change would render the revised draft more
restrictive of free speech than the original Exon amendment.

     *While revised section (f) provides some defenses for online
service providers, these defenses place smaller system operators at
risk because they cannot afford to assert the defenses in court.
Moreover, the defenses are incomplete and many larger service
providers would likely find themselves in jeopardy at the hands of
prosecutors motivated by the political advantages of currying favor
with certain pro-censorship groups.

     *Revised section (f)(2) fails to protect providers who cede
editorial control to an entity "which the defendant knows or had
reason to know intends to engage in conduct that is likely to violate
this section."  This could pose serious problems for Internet
providers that may have "reason to know" that certain sites are likely
to contain communications deemed to be obscene or indecent.

     *Revised section (f)(3) gives the Federal Communications
Commission the power to issue regulations regarding methods in which
providers may restrict access in order to avoid liability. Giving
federal regulators the authority to determine the rules for
distributing online content will radically affect the freedom of
cyberspace and will have a severe direct effect and an equally severe
chilling effect on online speech.

     *Revised section (f)(4) could still make it impossible for users
or content providers to remedy a violation of rights by an online
service provider if the service claimed it was attempting to comply
with the Exon amendment.

Conclusion

The revised Exon draft continues to subject an industry that has
blossomed without government control to an unprecedented amount of
interference and intrusion over content.  It gravely threatens the
free flow of information and the diversity of content transmitted over
online networks.

To achieve the liberating potential of the information superhighway,
Congress must ensure that interactive technologies enhance rather than
stifle democratic values.

The American Civil Liberties Union therefore opposes the Exon
amendment, both in its original form and as revised.

Subject: File 4--Advertising on CuD?  Say it isn't so...

I just read the latest CuD (7.41) and had to wonder about the O'Reilly
press release.  O'Reilly is generally a good netizen, but I don't see
how their $500 web server has much to do with the topics that that CuD
deals with.  After all, I don't remember seeing Netscape's press release
for their servers in the CuD...

                             ===========

((MODERATORS' RESPONSE: Jerry Whelan raises a legitimate point that
deserves an answer. CuD policy is to try to run articles that we
believe are of interest to the dramatically diverse readership.
Sometimes, these are promotional posts. Most promos are inappropriate.
But, in some cases, and O'Reilly is one of them, there is interest in
what they're doing, whether a promo or not.  O'Reilly puts out the
best line of Unix texts around, and that, coupled with the generally
informative nature of much of their promo material, makes many of
their promos newsworthy.

We should point out that we have run promos for web browsers,
such as Slipknot. We haven't run Netscape because they have
not provided us with any information.

We agree with Jerry's concern that there is no place for blatant
hucksterism in CuD, and we thank him for helping us try to maintain
the delicate balance while walking that thin line between readership
interest and inappropriate commercialism.

For the cynics, no, CuD receives no compensation of any kind for
run promos or any other post.))
