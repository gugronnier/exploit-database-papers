Subject: File 3--How BellSouth Calculated $79,000

(Moderators' note: The following article appeared in EFF 10 and
explains how those infamous E911 documents wound up with a value of
over $79,000. Guess it shows how figures lie and......)

                                   --OR--
                WHY THE 911 DOCUMENT COST $79,449 TO PRODUCE
                                AT BELLSOUTH

Over the months since it first came to light, many have wondered how
BellSouth could spend the immense amount of money that it claimed it
spent on producing the brochure known as the E911 document.

Now it can be told!

The following is BellSouth's actual estimate of its production costs
as sent to Bill Cook in January of 1990.  We were amazed that the
company felt it necessary to add in the entire cost of a major
computer system, printer and software.
