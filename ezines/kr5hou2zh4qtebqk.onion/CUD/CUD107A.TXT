LoD Update (30 April, '90)
------------

Gov't has arranged for 13 witnesses..give or take two...to testify against
Craig Neidorf in the upcoming LoD/e911 trial.   Several of the witnesses
are Bell South personnel, presumably to testify on the system that was
allegedly compromised. However, since Neidorf is not charged with entering
that system it is unclear as to why so many Bell South employees would be
able to give relevant testimony.  Other witnesses for the government
include SS personnel and a representative (to be announced) of UMC where
Phrack was produced and distributed from.

Summer Schedule
--------------

CuD will come out less frequently in the summer, probably about once every
3-4 weeks, depending on how steady the contributions are. If you are on a
student account that is closed during the summer, be sure to notify us so
we don't unnecessarily jam up the mails. If you come across news articles
about the CU in the news, be sure to send them to us.

---------------------------------------------------------------

--------------
FTP SITE
-------------

We have one FTP site, and we could use a few more.
The current FTP cite is:
RJKRAUSE@SUNRISE.bitnet

We are gradually providing the site with the bulk of our back issues of
ATI, PIRATE, PHRACK, P/Hun, LoD, and papers, handbooks, and other material
that researchers should find useful.

We remind everybody that requests for files directly from CuD should come
gradually, because we can only send out a few at a time.  So, if you can't
get through to the FTP site, keep track of what you need and send a note
simply saying something like "Send issues 25-30 of ATI" (or whatever), and
keep sending until you have what you need.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

-----------
Whither the BBS World?
------------

From what we've been reading (and seeing), the world of the CU BBS has been
changing dramatically in the past year. The elite p/h boards are fewer, and
the "lamer" boards are increasing.  9600 baud modems have changed the
pirate world, and there haven't been many new "special interest" boards
(cyberpunk, eco-raiders, anarchy, etc) springing up.  We plan to do an
article on the status of boards, especially on the changes over the past
decade. Does anybody know which was the first phreak/hacker board? The
first pirate board? Which was the all-around "Best of the Rest" in the
1980s? We'd like to put this in a historical context, so if you have any
ideas, send them along.  Better yet, write an article!
