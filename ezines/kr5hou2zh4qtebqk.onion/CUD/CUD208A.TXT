1. RIGGS SENTENCING
2. NEW FTP SITE

+++++++++++++++
Riggs Sentencing
+++++++++++++++

Sentencing of Robert Riggs has again been postponed for administrative
reasons. Sentencing has been rescheduled for November 16 in Atlanta.  We
are told that both delays are fairly routine and administrative and not the
result of any snags or surprises in the case.

+++++++++++++
Additional CuD FTP Site
+++++++++++++

A second ftp site for CuD archives will be available within a week, which
should increase the ease of obtaining back issues and other documents.

We **URGE** readers who come across conference papers or other information
that others would find helpful to pass them along so we can add them to the
archives. We assume that, because the bulk of the readers are
professionals, that many attend and present papers at conferences. If you
are one of these, please send along your papers.
