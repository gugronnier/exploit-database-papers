FTP
----------
 
The FTP site seems to be working well. The directories are not obvious, but
if you send us a note, we can provide the directory chart and info on how
to access files if you're having problems.
 
-------------
PHRACK 31
-------------
 
We have received several questions about PHRACK 31 from people wondering
what the connection is between the resurrected issue and previous issues.
The lastest issue **IS IN NO WAY RELATED TO THE PREVIOUS!** The former
editors had no connection with the current editors and they are not in any
way associated with it.  Some feel that the new editors should have changed
the name or taken a stronger editorial position, and feel the content is
not what would have appeared in previous issues. However, others have
argued that they find the issues informative and feel it is important to
continue the tradition as a way of maintaining a sense of community among
the CU.  We invite responses on both side.
 
-------------
MAILING LIST
-------------
 
If you have sent us mail but have not received a reply, it means that we
cannot get through to your address and the "reply" command doesn't respond
to the "From:" line. Just send us another note with several addresses that
we can experiment with, and we'll try again.
 
-------------
STUFF TO READ
-------------
 
John Perry Barlow has written the best summary and analysis of recent
events that we have read. It's titled "Crime and Puzzlement," and we
encourage everybody to read it. We also recommend Dorothy Denning's work as
well. She has not yet given us permission to circulate it, but if you're
interested, we will send your requests directly to her.
 
-------------
ERRATTA
-------------
 
LEN ROSE: In CuD 1.14, a contributor identified Len Rose as being from New
Jersey. The case is in fact in Baltimore.
 
TAP: A reader reminded us that the current TAP, available for the price of
a stamp, is not a direct offspring of the original.
 
PHRACK: A typo listed Phrack as originating in 1986. It first appeared in
November 1985.
