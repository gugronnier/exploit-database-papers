Review of Flanagan's JavaScript (by Warner Winborne)
Northern Illinois University


    David Flanagan's JavaScript: The Definitive Edition (Beta
Version) is a noble attempt at making sense of this troublesome
language.  Flanagan concisely describes JavaScript from top to
bottom, from lexical structure to objects, arrays, functions and
methods, and in so doing, dispels the myth that JavaScript is
merely a watered-down version of JAVA.  There are some
syntactical similarities between JavaScript and JAVA, but the two
languages possess separate strengths and weaknesses.  Neither
should be considered a substitute for the other, but they may be
combined in a highly complimentary fashion.

    The book documents in painstaking detail the structure and
elements of JavaScript.  Much of this should be familiar to those
who have experience programming in C or C++, but will be
difficult reading for the neophyte.  Flanagan then turns to the
more exciting task of explaining how JavaScript interacts with
the client.  Since JavaScript is a "scripting language" which
interacts with the client, the client's browser, and the
browser's contents, client-side JavaScript elements are what can
make JavaScript a dynamic language.

    As Flanagan points out so well, JavaScript possesses great
potential.  As an HTML-embedded language, it is restricted to the
confines of web pages, but within those limitations, it is quite
flexible.    Adding to the excitement is the possibility of
running JAVA applets within JavaScript with "LiveConnect"
(available only in Netscape 3.0). This effectively merges the
strengths of the two languages. Flanagan closes his text with an
impressive and invaluable 260 page reference section, documenting
JavaScript functions, methods, arrays, constants and event
handlers.

    But despite the exhaustive reference section and the careful
documentation of the structure, JavaScript: The Definitive
Edition is not the "definitive" work, as even Flanagan must
admit.  After all, how can a beta edition be considered
"definitive"?

    JavaScript is a programming language that addresses some of
the limitations of CGI scripts, most notably that they run on the
server side.  Since JavaScript is an interpreted language (that
is, it needs no compiling), it is possible for the client to
perform many of the functions of CGI scripts, thus reducing the
load on the server.  But JavaScript can also be used on the
server side to supplement (and even replace) CGI scripts.
Flanagan's book focuses almost exclusively on the client side.
This is reasonable, since server-side JavaScript (a.k.a.
LiveWire) is in beta release, and since most HTML authors who
wish to program in JavaScript may not have access to the CGI
scripts and cgi-bin directory on their ISPs.  As a result, most
of the programming in JavaScript can be expected to occur on the
client side.  Therefore, Systems Administrators and those who
desire to program in JavaScript on the server side may wish to
wait for the server side edition of the book, which Flanagan
promises will be forthcoming.

    In addition, JavaScript is replete with bugs (as most
webmasters should know).  Flanagan admits that "the most notable
feature of JavaScript is its bugs.  And the most common
experience of JavaScript programmers is frustration." He makes an
admirable attempt at documenting the most frequently encountered
bugs, but since there are so many of these bugs, and since they
vary based upon the client's browser and operating system,
Flanagan can only scratch the surface.  He acknowledges that
"there is a desperate need for a definitive list of known bugs in
JavaScript. . .  Definitively documenting all bugs in all
versions of Navigator on all the platforms it supports would be a
task more difficult than definitively documenting JavaScript
itself."So, we'll have to wait for JavaScript Bugs: The
Definitive Edition.

    JavaScript: The Definitive Edition is a well crafted, well
organized, indispensable resource for the JavaScript programmer.
While readers with experience programming in C++ or JAVA while
find the book easier to read and understand than will the novice,
it is possible for the uninitiated yet dedicated to begin
programming in JavaScript with the assistance of Flanagan's book.
Yet I remain unconvinced that I should begin to program in
JavaScript.  The fault lies not with Flanagan and his work, but
with the language itself.

    In the first place, JavaScript is supported by Netscape
(versions 2.0 and up) and by Microsoft Internet Explorer 3.0.
While Netscape continues to command a large share of the browser
market, it is folly to assume that the client will be running a
JavaScript-capable browser.  Both Mosaic and Lynx will completely
ignore all of your hard work with JavaScript.  So will Netscape
1.22. Flanagan recommends that webmasters who program with
JavaScript instruct clients to upgrade to a JavaScript capable
browser.  But what of the client who browses with a networked
version of Netscape 1.22 (or Mosaic or Lynx)?  It is not uncommon
for businesses and universities to make networked copies of web
browsers available to employees or students.  As a result,
upgrading is not an option for these clients.

    Second, JavaScript is unbelievably buggy.  In an attempt to
corner the client-side scripting language market, Netscape
duplicated its strategy to corner the web browser market.
JavaScript was thrust upon us early, so that it would become the
"default" language.  But what we got was remarkably flawed.

    Flanagan offers two JavaScript "tutorials".  The first
employs the Date object, which should display the local day,
date, and time.  The code for this marvel is

    <HTML>
    <BODY>
    <SCRIPT LANGUAGE="JavaScript">
    var now = new Date();
    document.write(now);
    </SCRIPT>
    </BODY>
    </HTML>

    This may or may not display the true day, date and time.  I
get the correct day, date and time, but the wrong time zone.  A
trip to the reference section of JavaScript:  The Definitive
Edition tells us that "In Navigator 2.0, the Date object has
quite a few bugs and is almost unusable."  I find it instructive
that the first tutorial employs an object so buggy as to be
rendered worthless.

    A further bug worthy of note is the Object.eval() method.
This method (with Netscape 2.0 it is a function), is used to
evaluate, and return the value of, code that is placed between
the ().  But for clients using Netscape 2.0 on Windows 3.1
platforms, this function has a different effect.

It crashes the browser.

    Of course, JavaScript is infamous for its security bugs.  The
initial release of JavaScript (with Netscape 2.0) permitted the
creation of code that would read the browser's e-mail address,
and then send mail from that address.  To its credit, Netscape
released Netscape 2.0.1 to fix such security holes, and this
particular one was hobbled.  But after the release of Netscape
2.0.1, it was discovered that code could be written which would
read and write files to the client's hard drive!

    Finally, and I believe most alarmingly, is Netscape's
admission that future releases of JavaScript may not be backwards
compatible.  Citing Netscape's online documentation of
JavaScript, Flanagan writes,  "Development of the JavaScript
language and its documentation continues.  Additional features
are planned; some current features could be modified if
necessary." Since JavaScript made its debut prematurely, it may
be better to jettison the "beta" version of the language when a
more stable form is released.  Regardless, the news that the
JavaScript programming I do today may not work tomorrow does not
fill me with the desire to program in JavaScript.  Nor am I
emboldened by the prospect of creating multiple JavaScript
programs (old and new versions) to accomplish one task.

    With these reservations, I can not help but wonder why
Flanagan wrote JavaScript: The Definitive Edition.  Flanagan
himself shares these same reservations, but claims that he was
hounded by HTML authors to produce the book.  Well, I can not
find fault with him for responding to demand.  But I must wonder
if the demand was caused by the frustrations experienced by these
JavaScript programmers, and by the hope that Flanagan could point
out the errors in their programming.  Unfortunately, the errors
reside in the language itself.

    Flanagan also claims that, like it or not, JavaScript has
become the default programming language for the Web community.
But this too may change.  SunLabs has just released a plug-in for
Netscape 3.0 which permits the browser to run Tcl (Tool Command
Language) application code.  Like JavaScript, Tcl is an
interpreted (i.e. non-compiled) scripting language.  And like
JavaScript's "LiveConnect" which is a "wrapper" around JAVA code,
Tcl is often used with Tk, its wrapper around JAVA and C and C++
code.  JavaScript may not be the only kid on the block for long.
Furthermore, Tcl/Tk is being released slowly. SunLabs has the
benefit of witnessing JavaScript's difficulties with security,
and has released Safe-Tcl to limit the security risks on the
client side.

    For the HTML author who simply can not wait to program in
JavaScript, David Flanagan's JavaScript: The Definitive Edition
is indispensable.  Well crafted, organized and documented, this
book will be useful to all programmers, whether they are new to
the challenges of programming, or "old hands".

    But for those who, like me, balk at the idea of the
frustrations that the author promises will accompany programing
in JavaScript, Flanagan and O'Reilly Press will produce a final
version of this beta edition, documenting the most recent (and we
hope substantially more stable) version of JavaScript.  He has
also promised the addition of a section with examples of code for
common tasks, which should be of great use to the novice.
Finally, chapters on server-side JavaScript, or LiveWire, will be
added, which should be attractive to those who wish to program on
the server side.

The title seems to allude to, and the book jacket definitely
trumpets, steganography, the act or art of "hiding in plain
sight".  An example of a steganographic message would be one
which appears to be an innocuous and ordinary family letter, but
which carries detailed information in the background.  One
chapter of the book does deal with this type of encryption,
although only in terms of hiding text data in pictures.  The book
as a whole seems more like a collection of essays on topics
related to encryption.

The topics represented cover a broad range of information
science.  The level of detail provided varies, but in general the
explanations are fairly simple.

                 THE INTERNET SOCIETY 1997 SYMPOSIUM ON
                 NETWORK AND DISTRIBUTED SYSTEM SECURITY
                              (NDSS '97)

                          10-11 FEBRUARY 1997

            SAN DIEGO PRINCESS RESORT, SAN DIEGO, CALIFORNIA


  This fourth annual symposium will bring together researchers,
  implementors, and users of network and distributed system security
  technologies to discuss today's important security issues and
  challenges.  It will provide a mix of technical papers and panel
  presentations that describe promising new approaches to security
  problems that are practical, and to the extent possible, have
  been implemented.  We hope to foster the exchange of technical
  information and encourage the Internet community to deploy
  available security technologies and develop new solutions to
  unsolved problems.

WHY YOU SHOULD ATTEND

  The use of the Internet is rapidly growing and expanding into
  all aspects of our society.  Commercial organizations are coming
  under increasing pressure to make their services available on-line.
  This in turn is increasing the need for rapid and widespread
  deployment of usable and effective network and distributed system
  security technologies.  High visibility attacks on the Internet
  underscore the vulnerabilities of the Internet and the need to
  solve its security problems.  There is growing concern for securing
  the network infrastructure itself.  Recent trends in software
  distribution (such as Java and ActiveX technologies) have made
  certain attacks easier to carry out.  Privacy has become an
  important issue for the Internet.

  NDSS '97 will bring together researchers, implementors, and users
  of network and distributed system technologies to discuss today's
  important security issues and challenges.  We have selected the
  technical papers and panel presentations that describe promising
  new approaches to security problems that are practical, and to
  the extent possible, have been implemented.  Topics to be addressed
  include Internet infrastructure and routing security, security
  for the World Wide Web, Java and ActiveX security, cryptographic
  protocols, public key management, and protection of privacy.

  The symposium will have a positive impact on the state of Internet
  security.  You will have the opportunity to actively participate
  in the dialog.  Ask questions of the speakers, raise your important
  issues during the panel sessions, and let other participants know
  of your requirements, observations, and experience in this
  important area.  We hope to encourage the wide-scale deployment
  of security technologies and to promote new research that can
  address the currently unmet security needs of the Internet
  community.

LOCATION

  The Symposium venue is the San Diego Princess Resort, a tropical
  paradise on a forty-four acre island in Mission Bay, ten minutes
  from the international airport.  Lush gardens landscaped with
  hundreds of species of tropical and subtropical plants are
  always ablaze with color and perfect for themed group events.
  Charming pathways wander among sparkling waterfalls, across
  quaint footbridges and sleepy lagoons filled with water lilies
  and waterfowl.  A white sand beach curves around the island
  for over a mile, and the award-winning grounds encompass five
  swimming pools and six lighted tennis courts.

  Spouses and family members can catch a convenient Harbor Hopper
  for a quick trip to Sea World.  Plan to visit La Jolla, the world
  famous San Diego Zoo or Mexico, only 30 minutes by car or Trolley.
