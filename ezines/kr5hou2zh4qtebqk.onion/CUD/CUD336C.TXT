Subject: Dissertations and Theses

The following come from International Dissertation Abstracts and from
persons who responded to our request for information on theses. The
dissertation list should be fairly complete. It excludes works limited
to computer crime or computer-mediated communication (contact Bitnet's
CMC newsgroup for information on CMC). The thesis list is incomplete
because of the relatively low number of institutions responding. But,
judging from bibliographies and discussions, there seem to be
relatively few CU-related theses. ("Dissertations" are normally done
for a PhD, and "theses" are written for a Master's degree).
