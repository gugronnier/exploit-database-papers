CuD Survey
++++++++++++++++++

Bob Krause has sent out the CuD survey, and the responses have been
excellent. We thank all those who are cooperating, and urge you to return
the survey if you have not yet done so. If you have misplaced it, drop Bob
a note at:
KRAUSER@SNYSYRV1
We will publish the results as soon as they are coded and analyzed.

++++++++++++
CuD Format
++++++++++++

Most people seem relatively unconcerned with our format, but those who are are
quite adamant. The overwhelming majority of responses indicate that the
current style should remain, so we will stick with it until opinion shifts the
other way.

+++++++++++
Euro-American Connection
+++++++++++

For those wondering what has happened to Euro-American Connection, and why
there is a voice message instead of Hot Mix's familiar logon logo: We are told
that the disconnection is temporary, and he is simply moving. Word is that he
will be back up and running when he's settled in a few weeks, and will try to
get the same familiar number.

++++++++++++
Riggs Sentencing
++++++++++++

For those wondering what happened in the sentencing of the "Atlanta Three"
who pled guilty a few months ago, we are told that the sentencing has been
delayed for at least a few weeks. No reason was given for the delay.
