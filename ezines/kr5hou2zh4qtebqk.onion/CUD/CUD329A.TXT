LEN ROSE ADDRESS
+++++++++++++

For those who missed the last blurb, Len Rose has begun his sojourn in
a Level-1 federal institution in North Carolina.  He reports that the
hardest part of incarceration is the separation from wife and children
(it's a long way from Naperville, Ill., to Goldsboro, N.C.), and the
intense loneliness of the first few weeks. He is assigned to menial
labor, and spends his "leisure" time playing cards, writing letters,
and trying to cope with his new environment. He *does not* have a
computer or a typewriter.

Prisons should be the stop of last resort for violent predators or for
those who demonstrate pattern of career criminality.  Nothing is
served by imprisoning Len or others like him.  Why not drop him a
humorous postcard just to say "hi?"

 Sheldon Zenner will continue to serve as as a conduit for funds send
 to help Len's family. Checks made out to Len Rose or money orders
 (*no cash*) may be sent to:

    Sheldon T. Zenner
    RE: Len Rose
    Katten, Muchin, and Zavis
    525 West Monroe Street (Suite 1600)
    Chicago, IL 60606-3693

Len's address for those who've missed it:

Len Rose  (27154-037)
FPC
Seymour Johnson AFB
Caller Box 8004
PMB 187
Goldsboro, NC 27531-5000

'Zines
+++++++++++++

The latest MONDO has been out, and from all accounts is first-rate.
Info on ordering can be obtained from   RUSIRIOUS@WELL.SF.CA.US

INTERTEK (Summer, '91) also is lookin' good. Of special interest are
the pieces by EFF's John Gilmore on "Preserving Privacy in America"
and the interview with sci-fi author Bruce Sterling.  The snippets of
news and reviews cover the new-hitek gamut, and where else could you
find a financial report that includes street prices of computers *and*
drugs? (The price of cocaine is down 25 pct--so much for the war on
drugs).

FTP SITE INFO
+++++++++

The U of Chicago ftp site address as changed:

The machine is now offically known as chsun1.spc.uchicago.edu although
chsun1.uchicago.edu is a valid alias. The ip address is 128.135.252.7
The archivist, Bob Kusumoto, will be unavailable for a few weeks while
recovering from a sports injury, so don't send email to him for
awhile. He should be able to throw the bull...uh, ball....with his
previous velocity.

A number of new files have been added, mostly 'zines, academic, and
legal papers. Bill Cook's opening statement in the Craig Neidorf trial
is also up.
