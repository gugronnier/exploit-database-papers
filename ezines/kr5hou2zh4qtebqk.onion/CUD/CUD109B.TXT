Subject: passwordless account argument in alt.security
Date: Sun, 13 May 90 02:54:18 -0500
From: Richard Duffy <zeno@zaphod.UChicago.EDU>


There is currently a thought-provoking, ongoing argument raging in the
Usenet group alt.security, concerning a user at St. Olaf College who
deliberately maintains a null password on one of his accounts there.  That
newsgroup has been engaged in a detailed, continuing discussion of Unix
security issues, especially concerning policies about user passwords
(forcing users to change them regularly, forcing them to choose from a
software-generated list of choices, etc. etc.) and the associated ideas
about the general need for security measures.  The user in question, Peter
Seebach, takes the provocative but firmly held position that Unix is so
insecure anyway that there's not even a point in having passwords for user
accounts.  He advertised in this highly public forum (Usenet) the fact that
his own account lacks one, and a major flame-war has ensued, partly
precipitated by the fact that someone, possibly a reader of his public
admission, promptly logged in to Peter's account and gave it a password,
thus temporarily locking him out of his own account.

The resulting verbiage has a lot of the usual puerile, vindictive,
posturing qualities associated with Usenet flame-wars, but in spite of all
that, some interesting points about "hackers," privacy, ethics and trust
are beginning to make themselves discernible through all the noise.  I
highly recommend it to those of you with Usenet access, for a little
mind-bending on some issues you might have thought you were already
completely decided on.  It's also rather entertaining!
