It is kinda strange,the first thing I read about hacking was Stoll's
"Cuckoo's Egg" and while reading I felt uncomfortably torn between these
"monster's and ogres" as he called them and my sense of right and wrong. I
definately felt drawn toward the hackers, but felt as if I was wrong for
feeling that way. Everything I have ever heard about hacking was put in a
negative light. Criminals, vandals etc.

My recent exposure to the world of computers has been, in retrospect, very
enlightening. I immediately upon working with computers at work dove into
books about DOS and such.  I constantly sought ways around our menu system,
although the techniques I used were very very elementary, I felt a sense of
accomplishment when being able to circumnavigate this login program. I also
messed a lot with setting things up to happen when certain people logged on
- practical jokes self deleting batch files and shit like that. I guess
what I am trying say is that I never equated myself with hackers.  The
media has done a good job of controlling my thoughts about hackers, I have
thought of them as criminals, and deviants who break in to systems and at
times mess with other people lives, as in the case of Stoll's book as he
described the medical research systems break in. Don't get me wrong - I am
not saying that I am a Hacker but was not aware of it, I am saying that I
seem to have the same drives and motivations.  I think to be a hacker that
it requires a lot of time and dedication, something to work towards. That is
something I plan to work on <grin>.

All in all, I just wanted to say I am glad I found a CUD issue on a local
(so called respectable) bbs. It has opened a whole new world to me, where I
already feel at home. I have a long way to go and a lot to learn, but that's
all right. The only thing that concerns me is that it is very difficult to
not feel the paranoia with all the busts. However, if I use my head and not
be foolish, I think I will be all right. There are a lot of good guys out
there who are helping me out. It is hard to establish trust. Some doubt has
been thrown my way, in my defense I was going to reply that the SS won't
ask the naive questions that I ask at times, but from all I here about the
SS, they don't seem to bright :-)

If your Digest has done anything to change peoples perception about the
current state of affairs concerning the world of hacking, it has changed
mine. Thank you.

State of the Law in Canada
----------------------------


Here are several excerpts from an article, titled: The Changing Face of
Computer Crime, appearing in the May, 1990 issue of Toronto Computes!.

     "Time is also in favour of the culprit," says Sgt. Greg Quesnelle of
     the anti-rackets branch of the Ontario Provincial Police.  "A computer
     crime committed years ago may go unnoticed or unreported.  As a result
     physical evidence could have been removed or destroyed.  If witnesses
     are available and can be located it is very difficult to obtain
     information from people who can no longer recall events as they
     occurred.

     "The police investigator is bound by the rules of evidence according
     to law when investigating computer crimes whereas the criminal has no
     such restrictions.  In order to obtain information pertaining to a
     suspect located on a computer data base a Criminal Code search warrant
     must be authorized, whereas a culprit may quickly and illegally hack
     access to information located on a computer mainframe," says Sgt.
     Quesnelle.

--------------

A little further on in the article we have comments attributed to a
spokesperson from the Royal Canadian Mounted Police. . . . .

--------------

     If a suspect can be traced, things don't become much easier for law
     enforcement officers.  Unlike laws regarding drugs or a stolen car,
     there is no legislation to prosecute someone simply because they
     possess stolen data, says Sgt.  King.

--------------

That's the state of things in Canada.  This should be taken, however, to
mean that there are no means to fight _computer_ crime.  Getting caught in
the act of taking data without authorization would most probably leading to
criminal proceedings and/or civil suit.
