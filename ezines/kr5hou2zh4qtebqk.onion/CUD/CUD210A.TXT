1. CuD TAKING A FEW WEEKS OFF
2. RE-SENDING ATI #51
3. MULTIPLE MAILINGS OF CuD
4. FOREIGN BBSs

+++++++++++++++
An Hiatus of CuD
+++++++++++++++

CuD will be taking a bit of time off. Gordon is off to Texas for a few weeks
to his company's training grounds. Jim will be at the national criminology
conference for a week, and then spending a week catching up on matters past
deadline. The next issue should be about November 17. If you have articles,
keep them coming, and be sure to send along papers you come across at
conferences or elsewhere for the archives.

++++++++++++++
ATI #51 will be Resent
++++++++++++++

Those who received ATI #51 from the nets noticed that it was about a third as
long as it should be. The reason was a formatting problem (periods in the
first column between files truncated the remaining files). We have corrected
this in the archives, but if you want to receive the corrected version,
contact the ATI folks.

+++++++++++
Receiving Multiple Copies of CuD
+++++++++++

Some readers have received as many as ten identical copies of a single CuD
issue. No, we do not send out 10 copies. The problem is that some mailers
receive a copy for an address, but then kick it back to each of the other
addresses listed in the blind carbon copy line. Sometimes we receive a
returned issue as "non deliverable mail," even though the posting actually
made it through. We have no way of knowing which bounces are accidents and
which are real, so we re-send, and this sometimes leads to duplicate copies.
Sorry 'bout that.

+++++++++++++++++
Foreign BBSs
+++++++++++++++++

We've received a few letters in the past week from Europe, Australia, New
Zealand, and England (yeh, ok, it's part of Europe) indicating that the
BBS/net world there should be addressed. We agree. SEND ALONG ARTICLES ON THE
non-U.S. scene describing the net culture, what the BBSs are like, or any
other news.
