          "Innocent Plea in Computer Case: Naperville Man Denies
                       Taking Key Program from Firm"
         From: Chicago Tribune,  December 4, 1990: Sect. 2, p. 7)
                            By Joseph Sjostrom

One of the first persons ever charged with computer tampering in Du Page
County pleaded not guilty Monday.

Leonard Rose, 31, of Naperville, entered the plea before Associate Du Page
County Judge Thomas Callum, who set the next hearing for January 14.  Rose
is charged with gaining access to a computer at Interactive Systems, Inc.,
a Naperville software company where he worked for only a week last month,
and with "removing" a program called AT&T Unix Source Code, which is the
basic operating instructions that tell a computer how to receive and use
all the other programs.

If the case goes to trial, the prosecutor, Assistant State's Atty. David
Bayer, will have to convince a jury that Rose removed the source code and
that such action was illegal, even though the code remained in the computer
from which he allegedly took it.

Rose's attorney, Sheldon Zenner of Chicago, expects the case will never get
beyond the first of those questions.

"Quite simply, he didn't do it," Zenner said.

Rose is under federal indictment in Baltimore for copying a similar program
from a computer there and putting it on a computer bulletin board, where
computer users could copy and use it without paying fees to AT&T.

Rose was indicted on November 21 in Du Page County. Naperville police and
state's attorney's investigators searched his apartment and confiscated two
computers and a number of computer discs.

"There were certain commands made on {the Interactive Systems} computer
which suggest the source code was copied, or down-loaded {onto another
computer}," Zenner said.

"So they looked for the source code on Rose's computer, but it wasn't
there. So they'll have to try to analyze the commands made on his computer
and I expect they'll have an expert testify that, based on his analysis,
the code was downloaded {onto Rose's computer}.

"But the source code isn't there because Rose didn't do it," Zenner said.
"I expect to show the court that a serious mistake has been made."

Despite the large number of sophisticated research and business computers
in Du Page County, the only other recent prosecution for computer tampering
was the case of a woman who used a computer about two years ago to take
revenge on an employer for firing her.

She was put on probation after admiting that, in a fit of anger, she purged
several programs from the company computer before departing the office for
the last time.

Otherwise, the extent of computer tampering and fraud is impossible to
know, though experts say the opportunities for such activities are
extensive.

*******************************

{Moderator's note: The story is a fair overview, but there is one major
inaccuracy. Len Rose's Baltimore five count indictment *DOES NOT* charge
him with "copying a similar program from a computer there and putting it on
a computer bulletin board, where computer users could copy and use it
without paying fees to AT&T." The federal indictment in Baltimore charges
him with two counts of sending a trojan horse login file (which is not, in
itself, illegal), and with three counts of transporting a very small
portion of a Unix file across state lines. He is *NOT* charged with theft
of that program in the indictment.  Nor is he charged with downloading it
or with placing it on a BBS where it could be downloaded.  This portion of
the story sounds like information provided by a prosecutor, because the
reporter indicated he had not read the Baltimore indictment.

The following is a voice-transcribed version of Len Rose's indictment of
December 3, 1990 (Illinois, Du Page County; Case # 90-CF-2635). The form
may not correspond exactly with the original, but it approximates the
wording as closely as possible.
The status hearing is set for January 14, 1991.
