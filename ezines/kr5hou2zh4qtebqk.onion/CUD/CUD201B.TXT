********************************************************************
 
+++++++++++++++++++++++++
Proposed amendments in the computer abuse act, reported previously in CuD,
do not seem to go far enough in removing the ambiguity from the language of
the Act that currently gives broad powers to federal agents to target those
they perceive as "dangerous" who in fact may not be. Following is the text
of the revision. We invite responses (moderators).

                      IN THE SENATE OF THE UNITED STATES
 
                            April 19 (legislative day, April 18), 1990
Mr. Leahy (for himself, Mr. Humphrey, and Mr. Kohl) introduced the

                     ------------------------------------
 
 
                                    A BILL
          To amend title 18 of the United States Code to clarify and
               expand legal prohibitions against computer abuse.
 
 1         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
 2    tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled,
 3    SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.
 4    This Act may be cited as the "Computer Abuse Amend-
 5    mends Act of 1990".
 6    SEC.2. FINDINGS.
 7         The Congress finds that--
 8             (1) the maintenance of the security and integrity
 9         computer systems has become increasingly critical to
10         national security, interstate and foreign commerce,
                                    - 2 -
1         communications, education, science, and technology in
2         the United States;
3             (2) the deliberate abuse of computers and comput-
4         er systems to cause damage, disruption, and interfer-
5         ence with the efficient functioning of computer systems
6         has created significant problems for both government
7         and nongovernment computer systems, and such abuse
8         creates real and potential problems for national securi-
9         ty, commerce, business, science, and education, and
10        imposes significant burdens on interstate and foreign
11        commerce;
12           (3) in light of rapid developments in computer
13        technology, it is necessary to revise and clarify existing
14        Federal laws governing computer security and abuse to
15        assure that novel forms of serious computer abuse are
16        clearly prohibited; and
17             (4) it is the intent of this Act to exercise the full
18        scope of the powers of Congress under the Commerce
19        Clause of the United States Constitution to regulate
20        forms of computer abuse which arise in connection
21        with, and have a significant effect upon, interstate or
22        foreign commerce.
