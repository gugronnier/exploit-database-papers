NEW CuD FORMAT:  The responses to the new format have been
overwhelmingly favorable, so it will replace the old format.  Thanks
to Gene Spafford who provided us with a digest maker that we hope to
have working soon.

READING THE NEW FORMAT: Usenet readers should soon be able to read CuD
as individual messages, making replies easier (thanks to Chip
Rosenthal). Those who get it as "mail" on Unix system can break the
single file up into individual files (depending on the system and
what's set up on it) with "burst" or, the easiest, with "inc". Those
receiving CuD on an IBM-type machine appear limited to a large file,
but if anybody has suggests on how to burst on VMS, pass them along.

MA/PHD THESES AND DISSERTATIONS: We're compiling a list of anybody
currently working on a thesis or dissertation on computer culture,
computer crime, or other related topics. If you, or somebody you know,
is doing this, please pass along the names and snail-mail and email
address. This includes international researchers as well as those in
North America.

LEN ROSE: Len Rose began his prison term in North Carolina this month.
Barring surprises, he should be out next May.  He could use some
"cheery" mail. His address is:

  LEN ROSE
  FEDERAL PRISON CAMP
  SEYMOUR JOHNSON AFB
  CALLER BOX 8004
  GOLDSBORO, NC 27531-5000
