Subject: File 1--SPECIAL ISSUE: THE TOM FORESTER ARTICLE

A recently publicly posted reprint of a letter in an Australian
newspaper, apparently originally done for the letter's author for the
purpose of generating discussion on the nets, has provoked
considerable discussion on usenet.  The author of the letter, Tom
Forester, has written several books on computers, including _Computer
Ethics: Cautionary Tales and Ethical Dilemmas in Computing_; _High
Tech Society: The Story of the Information Technology Revolution_; and
(as editor) _Computers in the Human Context:  Information Technology,
Productivity, and People_.

Because of the stature of the author in some circles, and because of
his gross inaccuracies, simplistic generalizations, flawed logic, and
inflammatory call for "get-tough" measures against "hackers," we
devote this issue to the letter and invite responses that we will
print in a second special issue.

Because Forester's comments deviate so wildly from his book _Computer
Ethics_, we thought the post might be a hoax, but upon checking were
assured that it was indeed the same Tom Forester and that the post was
legitimate. Despite the criticisms of the post on Usenet's
comp.org.eff.talk, and despite the fact that the article was
originally reported to be posted at his request as a way of generated
discussion, he has not participated in the discussion.

Below, we first reprint the CuD review of _Computer Ethics_, which we
liked, then a response to selected aspects of the public post by Mike
Godwin, and finally a detailed reply by Jim Thomas, writing wearing
his "professor of criminology" hat rather than CuD editor.
