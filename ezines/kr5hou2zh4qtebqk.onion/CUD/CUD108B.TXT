Dear Jim,

Nancy and I, uh... I mean Barbara are really proud of the great job you are
doing with all these hackers.  These are dangerous kids that need to be
kept off the street, I mean phone.

These kids don't have much of a chance in life without people like
yourself.  Without the care that you show them, they would probably live to
grow up as computer literates.  What a terrible way to live in this day and
age.

You know Jim, I have several United States Secret Service agents to protect
me from the holligans in the world, but whenever I can lend a few away to
bust up these hacker-types, I feel proud to be an American.  Keep up the
good work, and tell Gordon hello too.

Sincerely,
George Bush, k-rad d00dz
