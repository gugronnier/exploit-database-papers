Subject: File 1--SPECIAL ISSUES ON BIBLIOS AND RESOURCES

CuD has been a bit remiss this year in running bibliographic items and
research-related resources for scholars and others studying
Techno/computer-culture. Over the next two weeks, we will run several
special issues, beginning with this one, listing bibliographic items
and summarizing resources that might be of interest to researchers. We
will try to keep the bulk of the items confined to the special issues
so that those who are not interested in such things can delete the
entire issue.

As some know, CuD also tries to keep track of student theses and
dissertations related to computer culture. If you know of grad student
works broadly related to computer culture, please let us know so that
we can add them to our files and, on occasion, put folks in contact
with each other. We're also interested in receiving copies of
completes works (articles, conference papers, conference transcripts)
that we can place in the ftp archives.

                   Computerization and Controversy:
                  Value Conflicts and Social Choices

         Charles Dunlop         and    Rob Kling (Editors)
     Univ. of Michigan - Flint        Univ. of California - Irvine

Many students, professionals, managers, and laymen are hungry for
honest, probing discussions of the opportunities and problems of
computerization.  This anthology introduces some of the major social
controversies about the computerization of society. It highlights some
of the key value conflicts and social choices about computerization.
It helps readers recognize the social pro-cesses that drive and shape
computerization, and to understand the paradoxes and ironies of
computerization

Some of the controversies about computerization covered in this
collection include:
*    the appropriateness of utopian and anti-utopian scenarios
     for understanding the future
*    whether computerization demonstrably improves the
     productivity of organizations
*    how computerization transforms work
*    how computerized systems can be designed with social
     principles in view
*    whether electronic mail facilitates the formation of new
     communities or undermines intimate interaction
*    whether computerization is likely to reduce privacy and
     personal freedom
*    the risks raised by computerized systems in health care
*    the ethical issues when computer science researchers accept
     military funding
*    the extent to which organizations, rather than "hackers,"
     are significant perpetrators of computer abuse

The authors include Paul Attewell, Carl Barus, Wendell Berry, James Beninger, Jo
hn Bennett*, Alan Borning, Niels Bjorn-Anderson*, Chris
Bullen*, Roger Clarke, Peter Denning, Pelle Ehn, Edward Feigenbaum, Linda Garcia
, Suzanne Iacono, Jon Jacky*, Rob Kling, Kenneth

as, Judith Perrolle*, James Rule, John Sculley, John
Shattuck, Brian Smith, Clifford Stoll, Lindsy Van Gelder, Fred Weingarten, Josep
h Weizenbaum, and Terry Winograd.
           (*'d authors have contributed new essays for the book.)

Each of the seven sections opens with a 20 page analytical essay
which identifies major controversies and places the articles in
the context of key questions and debates. These essays also point
the reader to recent additional research and debate about the
controversies.

Subject: File 3--40Hex is now a print magazine
From: fortyhex (geoff heap)
Date: Mon, 16 Aug 93 17:19:02 EDT

     40Hex, the world's most popular underground virus magazine is now
available in two versions -- the familiar online magazine and a new
printed magazine.

     In the past two and a half years, 40Hex has become the most popular
virus magazine in the underground.  The new printed magazine (dubbed
40Hex Hardcopy) is intended for anyone who wishes to learn as much as
they can about computer viruses -- from the source, the virus writers.

     Each issue will contain --

        o A complete virus disassembly, fully commented in the 40Hex
          tradition,

        o Detailed programming articles, intended for those fluent in
          assembly,

        o Introductory articles intended to help those on all levels of
          ability, and

        o Interviews with virus writers and virus researchers.

     Also included is an editorial column, which will provide a forum
for discussions about any virus related issue.  Submissions from both
sides of the argument are welcome, and will be given an equal voice.


     Subscriptions --

The price for 40Hex Hardcopy is $35 per year for individuals, $50 per
year for corporations.  The magazine is bimonthly (six issues per year).

The online magazine is available free of charge from many privately
operated BBSs.  You may receive a disk with the latest issue from us for
$5.  Please send a note specifying whether you would like a 5 1/4 or a 3
1/2 inch disk.

  Review of IN A DIFFERENT FORMAT: CONNECTING WOMEN, COMPUTERS, AND
                 EDUCATION USING GILLIGAN'S FRAMEWORK
       (Author: Joan Carmeichael; A Thesis in the Department of
     Educatinal Studies, Concordia University, Montreal, Quebec,
                        Canada, January, 1991.
           Reviewed by Sabina Wolfson, New York University

        In reference to women's different voice, Ada
        Lovelace draws on woman's experience and woman's
        `voice' to describe an abstract mathematical process
        by using a weaving analogy: "We may say most aptly
        that the Analytical Engine weaves algebraic patterns
        just as the Jacquard-loom waves flowers and
        leaves."  This quote does not mean that only women
        were weavers, but that perhaps only a woman would
        compare algebra to flowers (Carmeichael, 1991).

Joan Carmeichael's _In a Different Format: Connecting women, computers
and education using Gilligan's framework_ presents a new way of
viewing women, computers, and education based on Carol Gilligan's
conceptual framework.  Gilligan's framework is an ethic of caring --
a interconnected web of concepts based on cooperation, relationships,
responsibility, and networking rather than, as is customary in a
framework of morality, separation and competition.

The first and last section of Carmeichael's thesis focus specifically
on Gilligan's framework and Carmeichael's application of it, while the
rest of the thesis provides a broad(?) and and thoughtful historical
reviews of women & technology, women & science, and women & education.
These historical reviews substantiate Carmeichael's suggestion that
"women are not equal participants and do not heave equal power in the
hierarchally organised industrial workplace, nor will they
automatically become equal partners in the new information workplace
based on computers."  This lack of equal power is examined through
historial reviews of women & science, women & technology, and women &
education.

* Women & science presents four women scientists, their work, and the
problems they faced, followed by a review of modern science, the male
bias of science, and how women have been and continue to be excluded.

* Women & technology discusses the rise of computers and the
Information Age, the myth that computers are `boy's toys', and how
Gilligan's framework can be applied to technological developments and
how new technology will be used.

* Women and education discusses the problems girls and women face
within the education system, the introduction of computers into
schools, how mathematics is used as a `critical filter' limiting
women's access to computers and science in general.  Carmeichael also
examines the attitudes held about women and by women: that "male
experience is...the norm, the yardstick against which any female
experience that is different is found to be deviant",the `we can, but
I can't' paradox, and others.

Bringing together history, computers, and women, Carmeichael writes:

        Women have been working with technology in the workplace
        for over a hundred years.  The first technological
        revolution in the office took place from 1880 to 1920 and
        saw the development and consolidation of the mechanical
        office and the entry of large numbers of women into the
        paid-labour force.  In the then newly organized office,
        women could hold clerical jobs - new, deskilled positions
        - as long as it was clear they could not advance to
        managerial positions.  There are two lessons to be
        learned from the first technological revolution.  One is
        that the feminization of office work did not change
        women's position in society, and, secondly, there is no
        automatic liberating quality to new technology. (Bernard,
        1984)

Carmeichael concluded her thesis by discussing how Gilligan's
framework can be applied to education and the work place.  Carmeichael
suggests that the traditional teaching style generally reflects a
`boy's style' of learning rather than a typically `girl's style' of
learning (based on cooperation and inclusion). " When we continue to
use strategies and classroom techniques predicated on competition
rather than cooperation, we preserve a macho perspective and fail to
view females on their own terms." (Lewis, 175 cited in Carmeichael,
1991)  In the workplace, Gilligan's framework can be applied by move
away from a hierarchical workplace towards a workplace of cooperation
(teams, networks, etc.) which is a viable alternative particularly in
an information-intensive environment.

Overall Carmeichael's thesis provides a strong(?) historical look at
women and science/technology/computers/education.  Carmeichael's use
of Gilligan's framework "fits" into the history she presents, but no
empirical research was conducted.

An aspect of woman and computing that Carmeichael did not discuss, but
which would fit in well with her thesis, is women and computer
mediated communication (CMC).  An emphasis on cooperation and
inclusion has been identified by Dehorah Tannen as a more typically
female method of verbal communication, and Susan Herring's research
suggests that this method of communication might persist into CMC.
Herring research suggests, as Carmeichael noted, that new technology
doesn't alter established inequalities:

        Rather than being democratic, academic CMC is power-based
        and hierarchical.  This state of affairs cannot however
        be attributed to the influence of computers communication
        technology; rather, it continues pre-existing patterns of
        hierarchy and lame dominance in academic more generally,
        and in society as a whole."

On the other hand, some research does suggest a egalitarianism in CMC.
Egalitarianism is only part of democratization.  Democratization also
implies equal access to computers and no prevention (internal or
external coercion) of participation in discussions.  There is much
research to suggest that neither of these requirements are met.
However, egalitarianism simply implies that, once individual are
participating in discussion, they do so equally.  In my ongoing
research, examining gender differences and similarities in Usenet
postings, it appears that CMC is egalitarian.  Specifically, my
research suggests that:

        (1) The average woman and man post a similar number of
            articles.
        (2) The average woman and man post articles of similar
            length.
        (3) The ratio of overall participation by gender (7% for
            women and ??% for men) appears to be similar to the
            ratio of new topic initiators by gender.  In addition,
            the amount of "follow up" discussion does not appear to
            correlate with the gender of the topic initiator.

Thus, in the public aspects of Usenet, discussions appear to be
egalitarian, though, since women only post 7% of the articles, Usenet
is clearly not democratizing.

   "SMOKING DOPE" ON INTERNET RELAY CHAT: A CASE STUDY OF PLAY AND
                 PERFORMANCE IN A TEXTUAL CYBERSPACE

             Brenda Danet, Hebrew University of Jerusalem

                Lucia Ruedenberg, New York University
                    <ruednbrg@ACFcluster.NYU.EDU>

     Like Richard Schechner (1988) we believe that play, not "work" or
"serious real life," is the ground of all of the multiple realities
(Schutz, 1977) in which we live. We are rediscovering this basic fact
of human existence in postmodern times: computers and
computer-mediated communication offer new possibilities for play, and
are altering common-sense perceptions of what constitutes "play" and
"work." We may be reverting from a stage in the history of play in
which leisure has been demarcated as a separate sphere of life
(Turner, 1974, 1986), to one in which the "playful" and the "serious"
are intertwined in ways which at least partially resemble those of
traditional cultures.

Playfulness is a prominent feature of hacker culture (Raymond, 1991;
Barlow, 1990; Meyer and Thomas, 1990), and of computerized writing of
all kinds. Its prominence grows as we move from basic word-processing
of author-absent texts (Heim, 1987; Bolter, 1991), to interactive
fiction, or hypertext (Delany and Landow, 1991; Bolter, 1991, chap.
8), and electronic mail and discussion groups (Danet and Ruedenberg,
1992), to interactive modes (Blackman and Clevenger, 1990; Reid, 1991;
Rosenbaum-Tamari, 1993; Curtis, 1992), in which writing is most
intensively experienced as "talking," and the distinction between
process and product of communication breaks down
(Kirshenblatt-Gimblett, 1976, Introduction).

 We are engaged in a case study of "deep play" (Geertz, 1972, 1991) on
Internet Relay Chat (IRC), in which the participants simulate *smoking
marihuana.* To borrow the title of a book by Victor Turner (Turner,
1967), the text we analyze is a "forest of typographic symbols."  Our
approach textual and micro-sociolinguistic, and draws heavily on the
anthropology of play and performance.

 This interaction is a form of play because (1) it offers a "flow
experience" fusing action and awareness (Csikszentmihalyi, 1977); (2)
it is dominated by the frame of "make-believe" (Bateson, 1972;
Goffman, 1974; Handelman, 1976); and thus (3) takes place in the
subjunctive mode of possibility and experimentation (Turner, 1974,
1986), thereby reducing accountability for action (Handelman, 1976;
Honigmann, 1977; Ben-Ari, 1989). Like sports and other forms of
competitive play such as verbal dueling (Huizinga, 1955; Abrahams,
1973; Dundes, 1970; Labov, 1972; Gossen, 1976), this sequence also
contains prominent elements of contest, or competition in the
demonstration of skill (Huizinga, 1955; Caillois, 1961). Among the
features fostering playfulness are the medium's ephemerality, speed,
and near-instant interactivity (Rafaeli, 1988), the masking of
identity (Kiesler, et al,, 1984; Blackman and Clevenger, 1990;
Honigmann, 1977), the influence of hacker culture (Raymond, 1991), and
the frontier-like quality of cyberspace (Barlow, 1990; Meyer and
Thomas, 1990; Melbin, 1987)--not only fully three-dimensional
cyberspace (Benedikt, 1991; Rheingold, 1992; Lanier and Biocca, 1992)
but even "primitive," two-dimensional textual cyberspace.

 Features previously thought to characterize oral, as opposed to
written, performance, are strikingly in evidence, even in some
non-synchronous modes of computer-based writing, but *especially* in
synchronous ones (Bolter, 1991: 59).  Verbal and typographic art are
important; communication is highly stylized (Reid, 1991). Participants
are conscious of their audience and pay special attention to the
display of communicative competence, to how their messages are
packaged (Bauman, 1975). Thus, the poetic function of communication is
dominant (Jakobson, 1960). The need to say in writing what we have
been used to saying in speech calls attention to the communicative
means employed in formulating the message.  The reduced transparency
of language heightens meta-linguistic awareness, and leads us to treat
graphic symbols as objects and to play with them (Cazden, 1976).

 In our analysis, we identify and describe an extraordinarily rich
variety of forms of play with identity, language, and typography, as
well as with the frames of interaction themselves. Play is at its
deepest and most complex when the participants not only simulate
smoking marihuana but communicate messages about the virtuosity of
their performance. They struggle to create a sense of "place," despite
the abstractness of cyberspace, simulate experiences of all the five
senses, and luxuriate in playing with the forbidden.

 In the last chapter of the monograph we discuss play on IRC as a
newly emerging form of popular culture. We compare it to jazz,
graffiti, comics, and improvisational theater. We elaborate on Mark
Poster's claim that "computer writing is the quintessential postmodern
linguistic activity" (Poster (1990: 128). Analysts of hacker culture
see hackers as pioneering explorers at the normative edge of society,
rather than dangerous anarchists (Barlow, 1990; Meyer and Thomas,
1990). Similarly, we see participants on IRC as pioneers exploring a
new communicative frontier, rather than immature computer science
students wasting institutional resources by "fooling around" when they
should be "working."

Subject: File 6--Classifying Grad Theses & Dissertations as "private?"

Date--Mon, 23 Aug 1993 14:18:00 EDT
From--LISA BODENHEIMER <BODENHL%CLEMSON.BITNET@UBVM.cc.buffalo.edu>
Subject--Interesting news story
Originally from--AUTOCAT <AUTOCAT@UBVM.cc.buffalo.edu>

In yesterday's Greenville (S.C.) News, there was an article with the
headline "New interpretation says theses are records, not research
tools."  To quote from the article:

"The Federal Department of Education has ruled that master's and
doctoral theses--research papers normally bound and put on the shelves
at schools nationwide--are student 'educational records,' much like
grade reports.  That means that they can not be checked out of
libraries, sent to faraway researchers, or called up through computer
databases without the author's permission, the News & Observer of
Raleigh (N.C.) reported."

The article goes on to say that making theses and dissertations
available for public use without the author's permission is a violation
of the Federal Education Rights and Privacy Act.  Ways to comply with
the law include having current students sign a waiver, tracking down
former students to get permission, or taking authors' names off theses
(this last has interesting implications for cataloging!).

There are obviously many implications for libraries here.  I'd like to
know if this has been publicized elsewhere, and what thoughts people
have (aside from utter incredulity) on this.  (FYI--this was an
Associated Press story from out of Raleigh, N.C.)  Thanks.

+++++++++++++++

((MODERATORS' NOTE: The new FERPA interpretation extends "privacy
rights" beyond reasonable bounds. The implications affect CuD and
other information-oriented journals and newsletters as well as
scholars. By sealing scholarship that has correctly been considered
public documents, a significant portion of research now threatens to
become "secret."

Classifying students dissertations and theses as "student personnel
records," thereby making them subject to FERPA seems a
misinterpretation of the Act.  At virtually every school of which I'm
aware, these are considered public documents because they are 1)
defended publicly, 2) "published" as a research contribution to a
specific field (regardless of the quality of the content), 3) placed,
usually by requirement, in a public archive of some sort (eg, U.
library, departmental office, U of Mich Microfiche).  Further, those
products that are subsidized by gov't or other grants are--if I recall
my own obligations as recipient--contractually defined as public.

While it might be possible, through intellectual aerobics and and most
obscurely narrow interpretation of FERPA to redefine theses and
dissertations as "personnel records" (and I'm not convinced that it
is), such an interpretation certainly violates the fundamental
principle of advanced-degree research by imposing restrictions that
subvert academic integrity and violate long-established principles
of free-flowing scholarly information.

Subject: File 7-- O'Reilly Internet Information Service

                THE GLOBAL NETWORK NAVIGATOR
            An Internet-based Information Center
                 O'Reilly & Associates, Inc.
        Free Subscription (send mail to info@gnn.com)

          Next month, we will launch a new experiment in online
publishing, _The Global Network Navigator_ (GNN), a free Internet-
based information center that will initially be available as a
quarterly.  GNN will consist of a regular news service, an online
magazine, The Whole Internet Interactive Catalog, and a global
marketplace containing information about products and services.

Keep Up with News of the Global Network
          The Global Network News provides a continuously updated
listing of interesting news items by and about the users of the
Internet, including announcements of new information services.

Discover New Interests in GNN Magazine
          Each issue will present articles developed around a common
theme, such as government or education.  Regular columns will cover
such topics as how to provide information services on the Internet or
help for new Internet users.  It will have several innovative
departments, such as Off The Wall Gallery, that exhibits in digital
form the works of new artists, and Go Find Out, a section containing
reviews of the Internet's most interesting resources.

How to find resources on a particular subject
          One of the most popular features of O'Reilly's _The Whole
Internet User's Guide and Catalog, by Ed Krol, is the catalog of
information resources on the Internet.   GNN features an expanded,
interactive version of this resource catalog that can be used online
to navigate to the Internet servers containing those resources.
The Online Whole Internet Catalog organizes Internet resources in the
following categories:

     - The Internet             - Arts
     - Current Affairs          - Libraries, Reference & Education
     - Science                  - Government and Politics
     - Technology               - Business
     - Humanities               - Work and Play

          In the Online Whole Internet Catalog, subscribers can not
only read about these resources, they can actually connect to them with
a click of the button.

Participate in the GNN Marketplace
          Getting good information from a company about their products
or services is almost as valuable as the product or service itself.
The Global Marketplace provides referrals to companies providing this
kind of information online through the Internet.  The Global Marketplace
also contains commercial resource centers in which subscribers may
find white papers, product brochures or catalogs, demo software or
press releases for the companies advertising in GNN Marketplace.

GNN and The World Wide Web
          Global Network Navigator is an application of the World Wide
Web (WWW), developed at CERN in Switzerland.  Users can choose any
WWW browser, such as Mosaic (available for UNIX, Windows, and the Mac)
from the National Center for Supercomputing Applications.  In addition,
O'Reilly & Associates will make available Viola, an X-based hypermedia
software environment in which we've developed a sophisticated WWW
graphical browser.  Viola makes it possible to distribute object-oriented
documents that use formatted text, graphics, icons, and scripts.  All
World Wide Web browsers can be used to access network services such as
gopher and WAIS, independent of the Global Network Navigator.

How To Subscribe
          The Global Network Navigator is available over the Internet
as a free subscription service during its launch.  GNN will be funded by
sponsors who provide commercial information of interest to our readers
in GNN Marketplace and through advertising in GNN News, GNN Magazine and
the Online Whole Internet Catalog.

     You can receive The Internet Letter electronically or on paper.

Although the first issue of TIL suggests that the newsletter will of
of considerable utility to Internet travellers, the issue of
commercialization of is troublesome. CuD is opposed on principal to
such commercial endeavors. In response to CuD's query, the author
presented the other side of the argument, one that we have recently
raised as well.  Namely, the time required to publish a newsletter of
reasonable quality (and, judging from the first issue, TIL is of
exceptional quality) can be prohibitive. The time required approaches
that of a full-time journalist who is paid a living wage. Should the
Internet be a mechanism for delivering a commercial product? The
question raises too many issues to be addressed here. We are of two
minds, and find the issues too complex for an easy answer. Perhaps
readers have thoughts on the issue they could share. Meanwhile, the
first issue of TIL is free, and it's well-worth a look.
