Subject: File 1--FBI Press Release in re Kevin Mitnick

                   FBI PRESS RELEASE (Feb 15, 1995)

       At 1:30 a.m., today, February 15, 1995, agents of the FBI
arrested KEVIN MITNICK, a well-known computer hacker and federal
fugitive.  The arrest occurred after an intensive two-weak electronic
manhunt led law enforcement agents to MITNICK's apartment in Raleigh,
North Carolina.

       MITNICK, 31, was convicted by Federal authorities in 1988 in
Los Angeles for stealing computer programs and breaking into
corporate networks.

 He received a one-year sentence in that case, and a Federal warrant
was issued following MITNICK's violation of probation.

       In this latest incident, MITNICK is alleged to have
electronically attacked numerous corporate and communications carriers
located in California, Colorado, and North Carolina where he caused
significant damage and stole proprietary information.   One of the
attacked sites was the San Diego Supercomputer Center (SDSC), and
Tsutomu Shimomura, a system administrator at SDSC, provided
significant assistance to law enforcement personnel during the
investigation.  MITNICK is also under investigation by state law
enforcement authorities in Seattle for separate activities there.

       As is typical in such interstate computer cases, may FBI
offices and United States Attorneys' Offices have carefully
coordinated their efforts.  These offices include the FBI's Nation al
Computer Crime Squad at the Washington Metropolitan Field Office, as
well as FBI and United States Attorneys' Offices in the Eastern
District of North Carolina (Raleigh), the Central District of North
Carolina (Greensboro), the Southern District of California (San
Diego), the Central District of California (Los Angeles), the Northern
District of California (San Francisco), and the District of Colorado.
Legal and technical assistance is also being provided by the
Criminal Division's Computer Crime Unit in Washington, D. C.

       On February 15, 1995, a complaint was filed in U. S. District
Court, Raleigh, N. C., charging KEVIN MITNICK with violation of 18 U.
S. Code, Section 1029 (Fraud and Related Activity in Connection With
Access Devices) in violation Title 18, Section 1038 (Fraud and Related
Activities in Connection with Computers).

            HOW A COMPUTER SLEUTH TRACED A DIGITAL TRAIL

 (c) Copyright the News & Observer Publishing Co.

New York Times, Feb 16

RALEIGH, N.C. (8.59 p.m.) -- It takes a computer hacker to catch one.

And if, as federal authorities contend, 31-year-old computer outlaw
Kevin D. Mitnick is the person behind a recent spree of break-ins to
dozens of corporate, university and personal computers on the global
Internet, his biggest mistake was raising the interest and ire of
Tsutomu Shimomura.

Shimomura, who is 30, is a computational physicist with a reputation
as a brilliant cyber-sleuth in the tightly knit community of
programmers and engineers who defend the country's computer
networks.

 And it was Shimomura who raised the alarm in the Internet world
 after someone used sophisticated hacking techniques on Christmas
 Day to remotely break into the computers he keeps in his beach
 cottage near San Diego and steal thousands of his data files.

 Almost from the moment Shimomura discovered the intrusion, he made it
 his business to use his own considerable hacking skills to aid the
 FBI's inquiry into the crime spree.

 He set up stealth monitoring posts, and each night over the last few
 weeks, Shimomura used software of his own devising to track the
 intruder, who was prowling around the Internet. The activity usually
 began around mid-afternoon, Eastern time, broke off in the early
 evening, then resumed shortly after midnight and continued through
 dawn.

 Shimomura's monitoring efforts enabled investigators to watch as the
 intruder commandeered telephone company switching centers, stole
 computer files from Motorola, Apple Computer and other companies, and
 copied 20,000 credit-card account numbers from a commercial computer
 network used by some of the computer world's wealthiest and
 technically savviest people.

 And it was Shimomura who concluded last Saturday that the intruder
 was probably Mitnick, whose whereabouts had been unknown since
 November 1992, and that he was operating from a cellular telephone
 network in Raleigh, N.C.

((Story describes 48 hour stake-out))

 A COMPUTER SLEUTH BECOMES A VICTIM

 On Christmas Day, Tsutomu Shimomura was in San Francisco, preparing to
 make the four-hour drive to the Sierra Nevadas, where he spends most
 of each winter as a volunteer on the cross-country ski patrol near
 Lake Tahoe.

((Story describes Christmas computer intrusion and taunting))

 By masquerading as a familiar computer, an attacker can gain access to
 protected computer resources and seize control of an otherwise
 well-defended system. In this case, the attack had been started from a
 commandeered computer at Loyola University of Chicago.

 Though the vandal was deft enough to gain control of Shimomura's
 computers, he, she or they had made a clumsy error. One of Shimomura's
 machines routinely mailed a copy of several record-keeping files to a
 safe computer elsewhere on the network -- a fact that the intruder did
 not notice.

 That led to an automatic warning to employees of the San Diego
 Supercomputer Center that an attack was under way. This allowed the
 center's staff to throw the burglar off the system, and it later
 allowed Shimomura to reconstruct the attack.

((The story describes Shmoura's respected credentials in
computer-security circles)

 WATCHING AN ATTACK FROM A BACK ROOM

 The first significant break in the case came on Jan. 28, after Bruce
 Koball, a computer programmer in Berkeley, Calif., read a newspaper
 account detailing the attack on Shimomura's computer.

 The day before, Koball had received a puzzling message from the
 managers of a commercial on-line service called the Well, in
 Sausalito. Koball is an organizer for a public-policy group called
 Computers, Freedom and Privacy, and the Well officials told him that
 the group's directory of network files was taking up millions of bytes
 of storage space, far more than the group was authorized to use.

((The story indicates that Koball found that odd, notified Well
officials, and the Well officials eventually called Shimoura, who
recruited to colleagues, Andrew Gross and Julia Menapace, to help
him))

((The story adds that the Well personnel set up a monitoring
system))

 Though the identity of the attacker or attackers was unknown, within
 days a profile emerged that seemed increasingly to fit a well-known
 computer outlaw: Kevin D. Mitnick, who had been convicted in 1989 of
 stealing software from Digital Equipment Corp.

 Among the programs found at the Well and at stashes elsewhere on the
 Internet was the software that controls the operations of cellular
 telephones made by Motorola, NEC, Nokia, Novatel, Oki, Qualcomm and
 other manufacturers. That would be consistent with the kind of
 information of interest to Mitnick, who had first made his reputation
 by hacking into telephone networks.

((The story notes that the intruder obtained Motorola security
software)

 But one brazen act helped investigators. Shimomura's team, aided by
 Mark Seiden, an expert in computer fire walls, discovered that someone
 had obtained a copy of the credit-card numbers for 20,000 members of
 Netcom Communications Inc., a service based in San Jose that provides
 Internet access.

((According to the story, the monitoring team shifted operations
to San Jose and Netcom to obtain a better vantage point))

 Late last week, FBI surveillance agents in Los Angeles were almost
 certain that the intruder was operating somewhere in Colorado. Yet
 calls were also coming into the system from Minneapolis and Raleigh.

 The big break came late last Saturday night in San Jose, as Shimomura
 and Gross, red-eyed from a 36-hour monitoring session, were eating
 pizza. Subpoenas issued by Kent Walker, the U.S. assistant attorney
 general in San Francisco, had begun to yield results from telephone
 company calling records.

 And now came data from Walker showing that telephone calls had been
 placed to Netcom's dial-in phone bank in Raleigh through a cellular
 telephone modem.

 The calls were moving through a local switching office operated by GTE
 Corp. But GTE's records showed that the calls had looped through a
 nearby cellular phone switch operated by Sprint.

 Because of someone's clever manipulation of the network software, the
 GTE switch thought that the call had come from the Sprint switch, and
 the Sprint switch thought that the call had come from GTE. Neither
 company had a record identifying the cellular phone.

 When Shimomura called the number in Raleigh, he could hear it looping
 around endlessly with a "clunk, clunk" sound. He called a Sprint
 technician in Raleigh and spent five hours comparing Sprint's calling
 records with the Netcom log-ins. It was nearly dawn in San Jose when
 they determined that the cellular phone calls were being placed from
 near the Raleigh-Durham International Airport.

((Shimora, according to the story, rode around Raleigh with a Sprint
technician, honed in on the caller by measuring signal-strength))

 At that point, it was time for law-enforcement officials to take over.
 At 10 p.m. Monday, an FBI surveillance team arrived from Quantico, Va.

 In order to obtain a search warrant it was necessary to determine a
 precise apartment address. And although Shimomura had found the
 apartment complex, pinning down the apartment was difficult because
 the cellular signals were creating a radio echo from an adjacent
 building. The FBI team set off with its own gear, driven by the Sprint
 technician, who this time was using his family van.

 On Tuesday evening, the agents had an address -- Apartment 202 -- and
 at 8:30 p.m. a federal judge in Raleigh issued the warrant from his
 home. At 2 a.m. Wednesday, while a cold rain fell in Raleigh, FBI
 agents knocked on the door of Apartment 202.

 said he was on the phone with his lawyer. But when an agent took the
 receiver, the line went dead.
((The story concludes by describing that it took Mitnick more
than five minutes to open the door, and when he did, Mitnick claimed
that he was on the phone with his lawyer)).

As widely reported, the "Exon amendment" has been reintroduced in
this year's Congress.  It would expressly extend existing FCC phone
sex regulation to online services of all sorts, and add a new
provision that apparently would make it illegal for an online system
or BBS to connect to the Internet, or at least any part of the
Internet that contains stuff that might be coonsidered obscene.

The Exon Amendment has been widely denounced by online veterans,
while at the same time gaining a lot of support from parents of kids
who go online.  I agree that at least part of it -- making illegal any
giving of access to obscene materials -- has got to go.  However, we
need to recognize the political reality that when the moralists and
family value types, represented in this case by Senator Exon, slam
their fists down against online pornography, then online pornography
has to give some ground.

But let's leave this mainstream discussion aside for a moment.  How
many of us are pausing, for even a second, to appreciate the
stabilizing effects of a law like the Exon Amendment?  With certain
adjustments, it can set up a nice safe harbor, giving onliners
nationwide far clearer guidance on how to stay within legal bounds.

With a few changes, the Exon Amendment can be a big winner, instead
of the latest chapter in the oppression of the online world.  With the
general subject of regulating sexual content of online systems on the
table, let's use the opportunity to get online systems the help and
protections they've needed for years.

Here are the changes that would make the Exon amendment come up a
winner:

1.  Get rid of the proposed change to the existing voice phone
harassment provision, Section 223(a), which would make it illegal to
"make available" obscene, etc. messages to others.  This would make
all Internet-connected systems liable.  Voice phone harassment should
remain voice phone harassment, and there's no good reason for skewing
the law this way.

2.  Have this national law preempt *all* state laws on obscenity and
indecency over phone lines, period.  This would be a BIG bonus.
Geographic localities couldn't set up "obscenity speed traps" for
unwary out-of-state BBS'.

3.  Similarly, have the law prescribe that all prosecutions MUST be
held in the county where the defendant is located.  No more
prosecutions where half the battle is won simply forcing defendants to
defend in out of state courts.  It would also help restore some sense
that the local community's values will control, though not formally or
strictly in this case.

4.  The law should also specify the "community" whose standards will
be used for obscenity prosecutions under the law, in a step by step
procedure.  First, the court should determine if there is a relevant
online community whose standards can be used.  Feeding into such a
determination might be, for instance, whether an identifiable
community defines its borders adequately with age verification
procedures.  If there is no such viable community, then the court must
look to the local geographic community where the defendant based his
or her operations.  If there is no such base of operations, only then
will the "offended" community's values be used for obscenity purposes.

5.  If the defendant is prosecuted in his or her role as operator of
an online system or service claimed to be illegal, then the prosecutor
must show that the service is  "generally and obviously illegal" to
impose liability on the sysop based simply on system contents.
Otherwise, the sysop can only be prosecuted for messages or materials
to the extent to which he or she was actually familiar with them, and
which he or she knew or should have known were illegal or likely to be
illegal.

With these changes, the Exon Amendment could be converted into a nice
statute setting out clear standards for a reasonable, national law of
cyberspace indecency and obscenity.

Anybody up for pushing for this approach?  It's a heck of a lot more
realistic than thinking we can win a war about online sex against the
moralists.  Confusin' 'em with reasonableness might work.
