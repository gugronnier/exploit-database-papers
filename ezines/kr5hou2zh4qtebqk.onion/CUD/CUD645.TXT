The Net Strikes Back
by Howard Rheingold

Originally published as a "Tomorrow" column in the San Francisco Examiner.

        How should Internet citizens respond when ambitious
entrepreneurs violate the Net's unwritten rules of conduct? The
question arose recently when two Arizona lawyers indiscriminately
posted advertisements to thousands of inappropriate online forums -- a
gross breach of Netiquette known as "spamming." Can the Net defend
itself against practices such as spamming without endangering the
freedom of expression that has made this global electronic forum
valuable?

        Some Netheads responded to the lawyers' ad barrage with
guerilla tactics, "flaming" the spammers -- jamming their electronic
mailboxes with impolite notes. A minority of zealots suggested
"fax-bombing" the perpetrators' office -- sending endless loops of
black paper faxes to the attorneys' advertised fax number. But the
proposed punishment that won the widest favor was one that seemed to
best fit the "crime:" Netizens were urged to e-mail the two lawyers
and ask for information about their business by paper mail. If enough
polite but bogus requests were blasted back at the spammers, these Net
users reasoned, then perhaps the price of finding one paying client
would be raised too high.

        But in the end, the most effective way of safeguarding the
Net's democratic code is neither guerilla war not the tyranny of
rules. Under the banner of "tools, not rules," some Usenet enthusiasts
have created computer programs to deal with online boors. A
"kill-file" can cause anything written by specified person to be
discarded without viewing; the messages will arrive at your computer
community, and others can choose to read them, but they won't be shown
to you as an option when you check different conversations (known as
newsgroups) for new postings.

        If a pushy salesman wants to crash a communal conversation
about health care reform or Haiti, the 16,000 people involved in that
mass conversation can put the offender's electronic address in their
kill files, and postings from the offending electronic address will no
longer be displayed on their computers.

        On Usenet, nobody can stop you from spouting any kind of
nonsense, but anybody can make you disappear from his or her own
screen. Using the available tools to bar unwelcome solicitors is far
easier than limiting freedom of expression on the Net -- it's also
morally preferable.

        Some people are now talking about filtering out all Usenet
messages sent by known spammers to entire computer communities on the
network. This mass screening would spare hundreds of Usenet
participants in each of those communities the trouble of listing the
spammer in their personal kill files. It would be easy for computers
on the Net to identify accounts that broadcast large amounts of
messages to abnormally large numbers of newsgroups, and alert other
communities instantly.

        Attention is the currency of cyberspace. If spammers learn
that the Net will demonstrate its disapproval and turn off its
attention in an organized manner, maybe they'll go away before they
damage the cybernetic commons.

        The attack of the spammers is probably just the first of many
coming collisions between human greed and common courtesy on the Net.
We need to get better at building computer tools and social contracts
that deal with such problems without entangling ourselves in rules and
regulations.

Subject: File 2--Netcom cancels Canter's Account (fwd)

Date--Fri, 20 May 1994 17:53:37 -0700 (PDT)
>From--Glee Harrah Cady <glee@netcom.com

Dear Fellow Network Providers and other interested parties.

NETCOM On-Line Communications has taken the step of cancelling the
service of Laurence Canter of Canter and Siegel, the lawyer commonly
referred to as the "Green Card Lawyer".  Mr. Canter had been a
customer of NETCOM in the past.  He had been cautioned for what we
consider abuse of NETCOM's system resources and his systematic and
willful actions that do not comply with the codes of behavior of
USENET.

Mr. Canter has been widely quoted in the print and on-line media about
his intention to continue his practice of advertising the services of
his law firm using USENET newsgroups.  He has also widely posted his
intention to sell his services to advertise for others using the
newsgroups.  We do not choose to be the provider that will carry his
messages.

NETCOM believes that we can and will refuse service to people who have
demonstrated that they do not respect the guidelines preventing
posting advertisements to inappropriate USENET newsgroups.  As a
commercial Internet service provider, NETCOM encourages commercial
activity on the Internet and believes it to be an important part of a
complete service.  However, NETCOM also believes that commercial
activities need to be undertaken in an orderly and thoughtful manner,
with attention to appropriate usage and sensitivity to the cooperative
culture of the Internet community.

Our position is that NETCOM can be compared to a public restaurant
where a customer may be refused service if the customer is not wearing
shoes.  For the health of the other customers and the good of the
restaurant, that customer may be turned away.  NETCOM believes that
being a responsible provider entails refusing service to customers who
would endanger the health of the community.  Customers, commercial or
not, who will contribute to the health of the community, respect the
laws of the land, and the rights of others, will be welcome.

With best regards for a expanded Internet community, I am

                        John Whalen,
                        President, NETCOM On-Line Communication Services

Subject: File 3--What is Spamming? (fwd)

In reply to the question "What is Spamming:

Spamming is sending out junk mail to a large number of newsgroups or lists.
Recent examples of spam include the infamous Cantor & Siegel Green Card
posting (5000+ newsgroups), Taford's Investment Opportunities (a piker at a
mere 200 or so lists), and the above-mentioned Skinny Dip (all the alt.*
and comp.* groups, at last count).

The use of the word "spam" in this context has its origin in a Monty Python
skit. (Spam (tm) occupies a significant place in Python symbology.)

Subject: File 4--Fidonet Crackdown in Italy - Follow-up  (24 May '94)


 "The crackdown needed to be done, software piracy has become a National
 sport in Italy. Unfortunately, the operation rapidly became too wide for our
 forces: right now, here in Pesaro we are only three Prosecutors, quite busy
 with penal trials, in court all day long. We will try to do our best with
 the less possible damage for the entire community."

 Here are the explanatory words of Gaetano Savoldelli Pedrocchi, the Pesaro
 Prosecutor who is managing the investigations that last week led to a
 nationwide crackdown on Fidonet Italia BBSes

 During the operation - confidentially known as "Hardware 1" - more than 60
 (some sources go up to 130) Bulletin Board Systems have been visited and
 searched by police officials.

 In the central and northern part of the country, several Fidonet nodes were
 closed and dozens of operators were charged of "conspiracy with unknown for
 distribution of illegally copied software and appropriation of secret
 passwords."

 Some figures say the seizures included more than 120 computers, 300
 streamer-cassettes and CD-ROMs, 60,000 floppy disks, an imprecise number of
 modems and other electronic devices.

 In some cases, police officials sealed off rooms and garages where the BBSes
 were operated or closed all the hardware they found in a closet.
 Several Fidonet operators (generally students, professionals, small-company
 owners) lost their personal data because every magnetic support was
 "suspected to carry pirated software".

 Aimed to crack a distribution ring of illegal software run by two people
 using the publicly available Fidonet nodelist, investigators searched and
 seized every single site of the list - even those that had  never had any
 contact with the two suspected.

 Also, many operators not inquired by police were forced to immediately shut
 down their systems, searching for possible illegal software covertly
 uploaded on their BBSes.

 As a consequence of such indiscriminate operations, the real, very few
 pirate boards had the chance to quickly hide their businesses - sources say.

 "I do not believe to this scenario," said the Pesaro Prosecutor in an
 interview by SottoVoce Magazine. "We acted after precise information about
 the activities of a specific data-bank: if some operators have nothing to do
 with the charges, we'll verify it as soon as possible."

 Questioned about further investigations against BBSes users, the Prosecutor
 said: "We'll see later....at the present, users can sleep peacefully:
 otherwise, I cannot imagine how many people should be investigated. I do not
 want to criminalize the entire population. Even if the inquiry has become so
 vast, this is not a subject of vital importance for our country. It is
 mostly a fiscal and bureaucratic issue, a matter of small-scale but spread
 illegality."

 However, rumors say other inquires are currently underway in other cities,
 and even the Criminalpol is working on similar issues.

 Assisting the investigated people, some lawyers already asked for the
 immediate return of the confiscated materials, while others suggested to
 wait for better times. In any case, it will probably take months (years?)
 before receiving official answers regarding the seizures.

 Struggling to re-open in some way their systems, Fidonet operators are also
 working to get the attention of mainstream media on the issue - with little
 success, so far. After an article published by La Repubblica, two local
 newspapers, Il Mattino and Il Giornale di Brescia, run brief reports on May
 15, both centered on "a wide software piracy ring cracked by police
 officials".

 But the real activity is happening inside and around electronic communities.

 MC-Link and especially Agora' Telematica (the biggest Italian systems) are
 doing a great job, offering space for news, opinions and comments - also
 acting as connection links between the decimated net of BBSes and worried
 individuals scattered in the country.

 Here is just one example: "....police officials seized everything, including
 three PCs (one broken), a couple of modem (just fixed for some friends),
 floppies, phone cables, phone-books. Now Dark Moon is off, hoping to have at
 least one line available in a few days, maybe at 2400. I fear that more
 raids will soon follow elsewhere. So, please, stay alert..."

 A catching dynamism flourishes from the BBSes linked to Cybernet. Although
 some of them are currently not operating, a special issue of the Corriere
 Telematico was just released over the net and their printed voice, Decoder
 Magazine, will soon distribute news, testimonies, comments on "Operation
 Hardware 1".

 PeaceLink has set up a defense committee-news center in Taranto and its
 spokesperson, Alessandro Marescotti, will sign an article for the next issue
 of the weekly magazine Avvenimenti.

 Promptly alerted, the International online community gave good response -
 quickly redistributing the news over the Net and sending supportive
 messages.

 Michael Baker, Chairman of Electronic Frontiers Australia, sent this email:
 "To that end I am writing to offer assistance to anyone in Italy who wants
 to set up such an organisation. Recently I (along with others) have set up
 Electronic Frontiers Australia, and I am now its Chairman. Other national EF
 groups have been, or are being, set up in several other countries (Canada,
 Ireland, Norway, UK and Japan)....if there is anything we can do to help,
 please ask."

 Shifting toward politics, on May 19, the first working day of the new
 Italian Cabinet, six Members of the Reformers group presented a written
 question to the Ministers of Justice and Interior.

 After a short introduction about telecom systems, the document gives an
 account of the facts and asks three final questions to the Government:
 "- if it will intend to open an investigation to verify if the raids ordered
 by the Pesaro Prosecutor's office were prejudicial to the constitutionally
 guaranteed freedom of expression;
 - if it is not the case to set up a better and greater team of computer
 experts in order to avoid further random seizures of electronic devices that
 lead to shut down the BBSes;
 - if it is not the occasion to confirm that current legislation does not
 charge system operators with objective responsibility for users' activities
 on telecom systems."

 Although the Fidonet sysops community (about 300 people) is still quite
 uncertain regarding its future, many of them feel the urgent need to
 overcome a sort of cultural and social isolation that clearly surrounds the
 telecom scene in Italy.

 At the moment the main issue is how to raise public interest and political
 pressure to obtain clear laws in support of civil rights in the electronic
 medium.

 Ideas and proposals are developing from several electronic laboratories,
 such as the Community Networking conference on Agora' Telematica.

 "We underestimate our strength: if we could just be able to set up an
 Italian Association of Telecom Users we could put pressure on political and
 legislative bodies."
 "We must attract common people, through hundreds of tables and events in the
 streets more than online, even if we do not have a Kapor to support us."
 "What about a 24-hours silence from any system in the country with
 simultaneous events in each city and village where a BBS operates?"

 The situation is rather fluid and in motion. Stay connect!

Subject: File 5--PGP 2.6 IS NOW AVAILABLE!

  +---------- Forwarded message ----------
   _MIT PGP Release_

                           PGP 2.6 IS NOW AVAILABLE!


-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----

MIT is pleased  to announce the release of   PGP 2.6, a free
public-key encryption program for non-commercial use.  PGP 2.6
provides for digital signatures and confidentiality of files and
messages.

PGP  2.6  is  distributed  in  source  form    for  all platforms.
For convenience, an MSDOS executable is also part of  this release.
Because source is  available, anyone may   examine  it to verify the
program's integrity.

PGP 2.6 uses the RSAREF(TM)  Cryptographic Toolkit, supplied by RSA
Data Security, Inc.  PGP 2.6 is being released by MIT with the
cooperation of RSADSI.

In order  to fully protect  RSADSI's   intellectual property  rights
in public-key technology, PGP   2.6 is  designed so  that  the
messages it creates after September  1, 1994 will  be unreadable by
earlier versions of PGP that infringe patents licensed exclusively to
Public Key Partners by MIT and Stanford University. PGP 2.6 will
continue to be able to read messages generated by those earlier
versions.

Because earlier  versions of PGP   (including  MIT's Beta  test PGP
2.5 release)  will not be able  to  read messages created   by PGP 2.6
after September 1, 1994, MIT  strongly urges all PGP  users to upgrade
to  the new format.

The  intent of the   format change is   to  discourage continued  use
of earlier infringing software  in the  U.S., and  to  give people
adequate time to  upgrade.  As part of the  release process,  MIT
commissioned an independent legal review of the intellectual property
issues surrounding earlier releases of PGP and PGP keyservers.  This
review determined that use of PGP  2.3 within the United States
infringes a patent licensed by MIT to RSADSI,  and that keyservers
that primarily  accept 2.3  keys are mostly likely contributing to
this  infringement.  For that reason,  MIT encourages all
non-commercial  PGP users in the U.S.  to upgrade  to PGP 2.6,  and
all  keyserver  operators to no longer   accept keys  that are
identified as being produced by PGP 2.3.

How to get PGP 2.6 from MIT:

PGP 2.6 is available from MIT only over the  Internet. Use anonymous
FTP to login to net-dist.mit.edu. Login as  anonymous. Look in the
directory /pub/PGP. In this directory,  available to everyone,  is a
README file a copy of  the  RSAREF license  and a  copy  of  a
software license  from MIT. Please read the   README file and these
licenses  carefully.  Take particular note of the provisions about
export control.  THe README file contains more detailed instructions
on how to get PGP 2.6.

Also in /pub/PGP is   a copy of the  PGP  Manual (files  pgpdoc1.txt
and pgpdoc2.txt) and  the file pgformat.doc  that describes the PGP
message, signature and  key  formats, including  the  modifications
for  PGP 2.6.  These are   being made available   without the
distribution restrictions that pertain to the PGP source and
executable code.

Well, there's a reason for this difficulty that you didn't mention.
However, you illustrate this additional problem later in your message:

How, then, will new "virus experts" arise?  Since I don't have extensive
contacts in this particular business, I can only examine the viruses that
find their way into our labs.  One doesn't learn much from 4 viruses...

That may be true, but there is zero cooperation between the industry
and interested parties out in the world.

I see this as a close cousin to the general problem in computer security.
I'm a good guy - a white hat, if you will - but there is absolutely no
way for me to "establish my credentials" within the rather close-knit
security groups.  Everyone tells me, "go to conferences, publish papers,
and things will open up to you."  Well, folks, that isn't an option for
most of us; I don't have the money to go to conferences, and I don't have
a prayer of publishing a paper until I can get my hands on research ma-
terial.  It's a textbook case of Catch-22...and a lot of *good* people
are chafing under it.  (Heck, one vendor wouldn't even give me an update
on a bug that *I* reported!)

Please don't misunderstand me.  I'm *extremely* grateful for the efforts
put forth by the anti-virus industry.  It's just that I'd like to learn
more - and, perhaps, even contribute something back - and I can't even
get my foot in the *$&^%(#(# door.

Not in the English language it's not; it's still nonsense. A shallow
learning curve would make it easier to become a virus expert, not more
difficult.

If the advances are so great as to render old methods for understanding them
obsolete, then a current expert (e.g. you) and a newcomer have exactly the
same learning curve to climb. If the advance is not so great, then a
newcomer, having climbed the original learning curve, has the same
incremental distance to climb as you. I assert that changes in the world of
Physics have been far more complex and been far more paradigm-shattering
than anything in the virus world, and yet we still turn out physicists by
the hundreds.

It has been suggested that one of the purposes such public virus
repositories provide is one of education; that is, newcomers to the
anti-virus world have a place to grab examples of viruses to disassemble. Do
you disagree with that purpose?

Ah; it's an oligopoly, then. A small number of putative competitors
restrict information to themselves as a barrier to competition. If the
conspiracy theorists are correct, that small number of competitors
also create and distribute enough "new" viruses to keep the learning
curve high for someone not already a member of the club. This is, of
course, merely a conspiracy theory; I do not assert that this is so.

You must be talking to a very junior FBI agent.  because there are
lots of ways to remedy this problem.  First, presentation of the
evidence to the clerk of the court.  They can send the information to
the judge,  who can convene a contempt hearing,  and have information
developed by US Marshals, the FBI under order and release of US
Attorneys files.  THe Judge can also complain to the justice dept
office of professional responsibility  or the Public Integrity Section
of the Criminal Division or The Inspector General of the DOJ.

The evidence can also be presented to the Chief judge of the district,
and these old men are not to be messed with.  They are life Lords of
the bench,  and unlikely to Like a political appointee of the Clinton
administration acting out of line.

The third course is to call the Congressional over-sight commision.
They can have the GAO investigate as well as hold hearings, and
wouldn't the republican senators like to stick it to Janet Reno.

The fourth course is to send the information to Jack Anderson.  he's
always good for a red hot pin to the eyeball.

Subject: File 9--Ontario Provincial Police harass Internet Users

Date--Fri, 20 May 1994 22:00:16 -0400 (EDT)
From--[anonymous EFF member]

Note: due to the current political climate in Ontario, please do not
forward this story over the net with my name on it. Reading the story
will explain why. There is increasing evidence that with in the next
two years we may see in Canada a similar situation as has been taking
place in Italy over the last few weeks with the shutting down of
'amature' BBS sites.

As reported in Toronto's EYE Newspaper [eye@io.org] (similar to New
Yorks Village Voice) dated May 19. 1994

 The London Ontario detachment of the Ontario Provincial Police have
begun a campaign of harassment against local University Internet users
who are attempting to use the 'net to gain information on the Karla
Homolka trial. A University of Western Ontario (London) student had
his Internet account frozen by the university computer staff when
requested by the Police. The reason for this lay in the student's name
being left on the text of a FAQ of the details of the trial. Another
student in Toronto had Faxed this material (which had been Emailed to
him) to the Toronto media, and the offices of the Premier of Ontario
and the Attorney-General as an act of provocation against the Ban (his
regular anonymous forwarding site was not working).The problem was
that he had forgotten to remove the other persons name and account
number from the original E-mail that was sent out.
    The police action against the student's account was done without a
warrant, and also involved the questioning of the student at the local
police station. Likewise the students home computer was searched
without a warrant by using the threat of criminal charges. The
Student's computer account was re-instated, but he was required to
turn over all incoming Email to the police under the threat of
criminal charges if he did not cooperate. A list of about 50 people
who had received Homolka FAQ's were passed on to the police.  The
important part of this entire situation is that no one, including the
Ontario Attorney-General office is certain that the ban applies to the
Internet. The ban states that details of the trial cannot be published
in the print media but there is no ban on possession of information.
There is no mention of the Internet, nor the use of computer systems
in the ban.  Further, there is no official investigation of the
Internet on the part of the Ontario Provincial Police, except for this
one detachment.

   One of the questions raised is the ethics of the University of
Western Ontario's computer department. Their cooperation with the
police was based on a fear of having their computer equipment
confiscated (similar to the case of the University of Cambridge in
England). If the situation had taken place with in the library system
of the university, it would not have been tolerated by the library
staff due to the long held tradition in that profession of the defence
of freedom of speech. If the Internet is to remain open this set of
values will have to become part of the professional comittment of the
MIS staff of universities as well.

telecommuting, distance learning, research collaboration at a
distance, sociological studies of electronic communication,
using electronic communication to access scholarly resources
and datasets, electronic journals, reader lists, bulletin boards,
remote access to computers and resources, cyberspace, on-line
conferencing, fax-on-demand, and telephony.

Topics might include but are not limited to the following:

- Implications of electronic communication for distance learning,
  extension, and outreach
- How BITNET and the INTERNET are changing research in sociology
- How sociological practice is changing due to electronic communication
- Research opportunities afforded by electronic communication
