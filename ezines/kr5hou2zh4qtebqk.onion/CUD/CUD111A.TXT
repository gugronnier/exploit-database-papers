APOLOGY TO WELL USERS
-------------------------------

In a recent issue of CuD we inadvertently reprinted the comments
of some users of The Well. Through a misunderstanding, we thought
we had obtained permission to reprint the entire file, but
the permission was limited. We apologize for any embarrassment this
might have caused.

CuD policy is to obtain permission to reproduce files that have
appeared elsewhere, and we do our best to uphold the norms of
etiquette that guide e-mail, ambiguous as they may sometimes be.

--Transcriptions of documentaries
--Misc. news stories

We also have *numerous* individual files of newsletters/info sheets that
were started but never got beyond the first issue or two, or were issued as
single-file documents.

Our goal is to preserve this short period of computerist activity in its
documentary form for the benefit of students, scholars, and other
computerists. We will provide E-mail copies at no charge, but hard copies
will require a stamped, self-addressed envelope.

Archived materials can be obtained by dropping a short note to:
