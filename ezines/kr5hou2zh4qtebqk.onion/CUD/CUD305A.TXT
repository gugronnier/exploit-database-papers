Retaliation is *not* the Answer
+++++++++++++++++++

We've heard "rumors" about plans for retaliation against informants and
others who have added to the victim list of law enforcement zealousness. We
have been, and continue to be, unequivocal in our opposition to such
behavior! Informants are a symptom of the problem and not its cause.
Victims are created by abuse of power, by ignorance of agents, by
inadequate Constitutional protections in a time of rapidly changing
technology, and by a cultural mentality that sees witches to be hunted in
anything mysterious.  We are not required to like paid informants,
especially when they appear responsible for creating victims rather than
protecting society. Sometimes, in serious cases, they are necessary, but
should be used with caution. But, they should be used with caution.
Informants, by definition, betray, and the ethical issue for law
enforcement is one of maintaining a balance between necessity and unethical
practice. It is this balance that seems to be out of kilter in the RIPCO
informant incident, and we view the problem as one of restoring the balance
AND NOT retaliating against the paid informant. Informants must live with
their conscience and with the stigma they earn.  From all accounts, law
enforcement agents respect informants as little as the rest of us; they
only find them useful. So, there is little need to retaliate: Loss of
status and the corresponding condemnation is sufficient response.  An
anonymous poster shares similar thoughts in file #4, below.
