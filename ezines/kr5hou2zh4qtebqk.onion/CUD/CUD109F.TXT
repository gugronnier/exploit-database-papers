***************************************************************


In CuD 1.05 I discussed the Software Publisher's Association (SPA)
toll-free piracy hot line and the less than informative response my call
recieved.  As an addendum here is some information culled from "PC
Computing" March 1990, Page 80.

Software Manufacturers Tempt Illegal Users to Change Their Evil Ways

This brief article, written by Christine Triano, discusses "amnesty"
programs offered by XTree, XyQuest, and Unison World where users could
"register" pirated copies of XTree Pro, Xywrite, and Printmaster Plus
(respectively) and recieve legitimate versions at a reduced cost. XTree
reports that 5000 people took them up on their SAFE (Software Amnesty Fore
Everyone) offer, but the other companies have so far declined to comment on
the success of thier programs.

Also discussed is the SPA's auditing process where the SPA asks companies
that are suspected of being users of pirated warez to let the Association
examine hard drives and software purchase records, in return for strict
confidentiality of the outcome.  The corporation then purchases legitimate
copies of all the pirated programs found, and "contributes" an equal amount
to the SPA's Copyright Protection Fund.  Thus the software gets purchased,
the SPA's coffers are lined, and the corporation stays out of court.  To
date "more than half a dozen" audits have been conducted.

The article concludes with a short paragraph concerning the toll-free
piracy hotline:
    "The SPA has also set up a toll-free piracy hot line (800-388-PIR8).
According to SPA director Ken Wasch, the hot line receives 15 serious calls
a week.  Who finks? The majority of callers are unhappy or former employees
serving up their own version of just desserts."



Final Note:  Perhaps the "Ken" I spoke to at the SPA is Ken Wasch, the
director of the organization.  If so, I wonder if he considered my call
about a pirate BBS to be "serious"?
