(From the CHICAGO TRIBUNE, May 5, 1990 (p. II-1).
COMPUTER TAMPERER FINED. Computer expert Robert T. Morris was sentenced to
three years' probation and fined $10,000 for creating a "worm" program that
paralyzed thousand of computers nationwide.  U.S. District Judge Howard
Munson in Syracuse, N.Y., also ordered Morris, 25, to perform 400 hours of
community service. Morris did not speak at the sentencing or talk to
reporters after the hearing. He remained grim-faced through most of the
hearing, then cracked a wide smile and hugged his mother when the sentence
was announced.

                HACKER, 12, FACES CREDIT CARD FRAUD CHARGES
 
DETROIT (AP)--A 12-year-old computer hacker has been accused of gaining
access to the computers of TRW Inc. and distributing credit card charge
numbers to computer bulletin boards.
 
State police said authorities were preparing to charge the youth with
computer fraud and financial transaction fraud. The boy's computer and
files were seized Thursday from his Grosse Ile home, police said. He has
not been arrested.
 
Officials were uncertain how many files were tapped, who used the credit
card numbers and what was purchased with them.  But officials said TRW, a
national company that checks credit ratings, noticed the improper entry to
their system and contacted authorities.
 
The boy's mother said he worked on the computer for up to five hours every
weeknight and even longer on weekends.
 
"He didn't bother me," she said. "Well, I figured, computers,
that's the thing of the day.

POLICE RADIO, 911 JAMMED; MAN ARRESTED.
  By Rusty Pierce, Camera Staff Writer
 
A man who is suspected of jamming police radio frequencies and interfering
with emergency 911 telephone lines has been arrested by University of
Colorado police.
 
CU police announced Tuesday that they had arrested Robert Matthew Sklar,
24, of 2882 Sundown Lane, Apt. 203, for investigation of wiretapping, a
felony, and obstructing government operations, a misdemeanor.
 
Sklar was contacted recently by police when he refused to leave the Duane
Physics Building [site of lots of public computer workstations] during a
fire alarm test.  He initially refused to cooperate but later gave his name
and address.  Sgt. John Kish issued him a warning for interfering with the
test.
 
Shortly after that, someone started jamming the CU police department's
radio frequencies and interfering with its 911 emergency lines.
 
Kish said police had "reasonable suspicion" to believe that Sklar may have
been involved.  After a week-long investigation that included tracking the
radio signal, police developed enough evidence to obtain a warrant to
search Sklar's house.  When police went to his home to search, Sklar
returned home in a car.
 
Several radios and pieces of equipment were in the car, Kish said.
 
"We were really concerned.  It was tying up incoming emergency lines.  When
the radio was jammed we were not able to communicate in the field," Kish
said.
 
Police also have served Sklar with a notice to confiscate his vehicle under
Colorado's public nuisance statue because they believe he sometimes jammed
the frequencies from inside his vehicle.
 
Police believe he used a two-way radio to jam the police radio and computer
equipment to tie up the 911 emergency lines, Kish said.
 
Voice prints of the radio that jammed the frequencies and voice prints of
the confiscated radio equipment will be compared by experts.
 
Sklar, a continuing education student at CU, is scheduled to appear in
Boulder County Court today at 2 p.m.
