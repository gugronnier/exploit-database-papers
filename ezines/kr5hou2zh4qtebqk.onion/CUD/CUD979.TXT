-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA1

It is a great privilege and we are excited to announce that at 13:25
GMT on 19-Oct-1997, we found the correct solution for RSA Labs' RC5-
32/12/7 56-bit secret-key challenge.  Confirmed by RSA Labs, the key
0x532B744CC20999 presented us with the plaintext message for which we
have been searching these past 250 days.

The unknown message is: It's time to move to a longer key length

In undeniably the largest distributed-computing effort ever, the
Bovine RC5 Cooperative (http://www.distributed.net/), under the
leadership of distributed.net, managed to evaluate 47% of the
keyspace, or 34 quadrillion keys, before finding the winning key.  At
the close of this contest our 4000 active teams were processing over
7 billion keys each second at an aggregate computing power equivalent
to more than 26 thousand Pentium 200's or over 11 thousand PowerPC
604e/200's.  Over the course of the project, we received block
submissions from over 500 thousand unique IP addresses.

The winning key was found by Peter Stuer <peter@dinf.vub.ac.be> with
an Intel Pentium Pro 200 running Windows NT Workstation, working for
the STARLab Bovine Team coordinated by Jo Hermans
<Jo.Hermans@vub.ac.be> and centered in the Computer Science
Department (DINF) of the Vrije Universiteit (VUB) in Brussels,
Belgium.  (http://dinf.vub.ac.be/bovine.html/).  Jo's only comments
were that "$1000 will buy a lot of beer" and that he wished that the
solution had been found by a Macintosh, the platform that represented
the largest portion of his team's cracking power.  Congratulations
Peter and Jo!

Of the US$10000 prize from RSA Labs, they will receive US$1000 and
plan to host an unforgettable party in celebration of our collective
victory.  If you're anywhere near Brussels, you might want to find
out when the party will be held.  US$8000, of course, is being
donated to Project Gutenberg (http://www.promo.net/pg/) to assist
them in their continuing efforts in converting literature into
electronic format for the public use.  The remaining US$1000 is being
retained by distributed.net to assist in funding future projects.

Equally important are the thanks, accolades, and congratulations due
to all who participated and contributed to the Bovine RC5-56 Effort!
The thousands of teams and tens of thousands of individuals who have
diligently tested key after key are the reason we are so successful.

The thrill of finding the key more than compensates for the sleep,
food, and free time that we've sacrificed!

Special thanks go to all the coders and developers, especially Tim
Charron, who has graciously given his time and expertise since the
earliest days of the Bovine effort.  Thanks to all the coordinators
and keyserver operators: Chris Chiapusio, Paul Chvostek, Peter
Denitto, Peter Doubt, Mishari Muqbil,  Steve Sether, and Chris
Yarnell.  Thanks to Andrew Meggs, Roderick Mann, and Kevyn Shortell
for showing us the true power of the Macintosh and the strength of
its users.  We'd also like to thank Dave Avery for attempting to
bridge the gap between Bovine and the other RC5 efforts.

Once again, a heartfelt clap on the back goes out to all of us who
have run the client.  Celebrations are in order.  I'd like to invite
any and all to join us on the EFNet IRC network channel #rc5 for
celebrations as we regroup and set our sights on the next task.  Now
that we've proven the limitations of a 56-bit key length, let's go
one further and demonstrate the power of distributed computing!  We
are, all of us, the future of computing.  Join the excitement as the
world is forced to take notice of the power we've harnessed.

Moo and a good hearty laugh.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE                                          AT
MONDAY, OCTOBER 20, 1997                           (202) 616-2771
                                               TDD (202) 514-1888


            JUSTICE DEPARTMENT CHARGES MICROSOFT WITH
                    VIOLATING 1995 COURT ORDER


Asks Court to Impose $1 Million a Day Fine if Violation Continues

     WASHINGTON, D.C. -- The Department of Justice asked a
federal court today to hold Microsoft Corporation--the world's
dominant personal computer software company--in civil contempt
for violating terms of a 1995 court order barring it from
imposing anticompetitive licensing terms on manufacturers of
personal computers.

     The petition filed today by the Department's Antitrust
Division alleges that Microsoft violated the court order by
requiring PC manufacturers to license and distribute Microsoft's
Internet browser, called Internet Explorer, as a condition of
licensing Microsoft's Windows 95.  Most PC makers preinstall
Windows 95--the dominant PC operating system--at the factory on
the PCs they sell.

     "Microsoft is unlawfully taking advantage of its Windows
monopoly to protect and extend that monopoly and undermine
consumer choice," said Attorney General Janet Reno.

     The Department brought today's action to enforce the earlier
court order, and to prevent Microsoft from being able to expand
and protect its monopoly in the PC operating system market by
anticompetitive means.  The Department also wants to ensure that
PC manufacturers and consumers will be able to choose among
competing software products.

     "Our main concern is that by violating the court order,
Microsoft is using an unlawful advantage to beat back an
important competitive challenge to its Windows monopoly," said
Joel I. Klein, Assistant Attorney General in charge of the
Department's Antitrust Division.  "Even as we go forward with
this action today," Klein added, "we also want to make clear that
we have an ongoing and wide-ranging investigation to determine
whether Microsoft's actions are stifling innovation and consumer
choice."

     Much of Microsoft's market power today results because most
applications programs for PCs--programs such as word processing,
spread sheets and money managers--are written to work with
Microsoft's Windows 95 PC operating system, the Department said.
Unfettered competition among Internet browser products could lead
to development of a computer environment in which business and
consumer applications would work regardless of which operating
system was installed on the PC.  Software companies are currently
developing applications that use an Internet browser as the user
interface and work on other operating systems as well as with
Windows 95.

     Microsoft's operating system is installed on more than 80
percent of the nation's PCs, and preinstallation on PCs at the
factory is Microsoft's main distribution channel.

     Under the 1995 court order, Microsoft is prohibited from
forcing computer makers to license any other Microsoft product as
a condition of licensing Windows 95.  Many PC manufacturers want
the ability to choose freely among competing software products
when they decide what to package with their PCs in order to offer
their customers the best mix of software products available.

     The petition charges that Microsoft has conditioned licenses
to Windows 95 on manufacturers' licensing of Internet Explorer
and that it has denied manufacturers' requests not to ship
Internet Explorer on new PCs with Windows 95.

     The Department stressed that it is not taking sides in the
"browser war" between Microsoft and its rival, Netscape
Communications Corporation, or in any emerging competition
between Windows and other products.

     "Microsoft is not entitled to require computer manufacturers
and consumers to take Internet Explorer when they license Windows
95," said Klein.  "Each of Microsoft's products should compete on
its own merits."

     Klein stressed, however, that today's action in no way
prevents consumers or PC manufacturers from voluntarily choosing
to obtain Internet Explorer and Windows 95, either together or
separately, if they so wish.

     In its petition, the Department asked the court:

     *  To stop Microsoft from requiring PC manufacturers to
        accept Internet Explorer as a condition of receiving Windows 95.

     *  To require Microsoft to notify consumers of PCs that have
        Windows 95 that they are not required to use Internet Explorer,
        that they are free to use any compatible Internet browser, and to
        give consumers simple instructions about how to remove the
        Internet Explorer icon from their PC desktop if they choose.

     *  To impose large daily fines--$1 million--on Microsoft if
        it continues to violate the court's order.

     *  To strike down broad portions of non-disclosure
        agreements that Microsoft requires those with whom it does
        business to sign.

     The non-disclosure agreements may deter companies and
individuals from coming forward voluntarily to provide
information about Microsoft to the Department.  Moreover, they
sometimes require signatories to notify Microsoft first before
complying with the Department's formal requests, or even court
orders, for such information.

     Microsoft has advised the Department that it would not
insist on prior disclosure when the Department approaches
companies or individuals and assures them that it will keep
information confidential.  But, this informal agreement, Klein
said, does not address the concerns of parties who wish to come
forward voluntarily.

     Klein stressed the importance of full, voluntary disclosure
of information relevant to the Department's larger investigation
of Microsoft's practices.  He expressed concern that the broad
non-disclosure agreements could possibly hamper its investigation
and indicated that, to remove any possible impediment, even if
unintended, the Department was seeking a court order.

     "We need a court order to clear the air here so that anyone
with relevant information will feel free to come talk to the
Department without any fear of intimidation or reprisal," Klein
said.  "We will not let Microsoft or anyone else burden that
fundamental right."

     Today's petition was filed in U.S. District Court for the
District of Columbia, where the 1995 consent decree was entered.

     Microsoft will have an opportunity to respond to the
Department's petition in writing within 11 days.  At that time,
the judge will decide whether a hearing is appropriate.

Subject: File 3--Microsoft's reaction the the DOJ lawsuit

Here's an interesting press release on Microsoft's reaction to the the DOJ
lawsuit:

REDMOND, Wash. - Oct. 21, 1997 -- In direct response to accusations
made by the Department of Justice, the Microsoft Corp. announced today
that it will be acquiring the federal government of the United States of
America for an undisclosed sum.

"It's actually a logical extension of our planned growth," said Microsoft
chairman Bill Gates, "It really is going to be a positive arrangement for
everyone."

Microsoft representatives held a briefing in the oval office of the White
House with U.S. President Bill Clinton, and assured members of the press
that changes will be "minimal." The United States will be managed as a
wholly owned division of Microsoft. An initial public offering is planned
for July of next year, and the federal government is expected to be
profitable by "Q4 1999 at latest," according to Microsoft president Steve
Ballmer.

In a related announcement, Bill Clinton stated that he had "willingly and
enthusiastically" accepted a position as a vice president with Microsoft,
and will continue to manage the United States government, reporting
directly to Bill Gates. When asked how it felt to give up the mantle of
executive authority to Gates, Clinton smiled and referred to it as "a
relief." He went on to say that Gates has a "proven track record", and
that U.S. citizens should offer Gates their "full support and
confidence." Clinton will
reportedly be earning several times the $200,000 annually he has earned
as U.S. president, in his new role at Microsoft.

Gates dismissed a suggestion that the U.S. Capitol be moved to Redmond as
"silly," though did say that he would make executive decisions for the U.S.
government from his existing office at Microsoft headquarters. Gates went
on to say that the House and Senate would "of course" be abolished.
"Microsoft isn't a democracy," he observed, "and look how well we're doing."

When asked if the rumored attendant acquisition of Canada was proceeding,
Gates said, "We don't deny that discussions are taking place." Microsoft
representatives closed the conference by stating that United States
citizens will be able to expect lower taxes, increases in government
services and discounts on all Microsoft products.

Washington --In this boneyard of Washington, DC it doesn't take
long for big dawgs and small alike to bark.  A couple of small
ones yipped it up today.

Rep. Marge (no relation to Homer) Roukema, R-N.J. and Sen. Lauch
(??) Faircloth, R-N.C. introduced a bill to amend the
Communications Act that would ban convicted sex offenders from
using the Internet.

"We must protect our children by denying convicted violent sex
offenders this form of access to their victims," Roukema said.
[Hey, you knew THAT line was coming...]

Roukema calls this a "practical, workable bill."  Because known
sex offenders must register, the bill will work! she says.  No,
no, no, this is NOT an infringement of the 1st Amendment.  After
all, she says, if a felon can be denied the right to vote, a
violent sex offender can certainly be denied the right to
'cruise' the Internet looking for victims," she says.

[Okay.  Line up HERE: to take your one free shot at this brain
dead logic.]

The bill bars interactive service providers from giving sex
offenders an account.  Break that law and you get fined $5,000
for each day the perp is online.

Cyber-liberties Update
October 17, 1997


~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Illinois Library Decides Not to Filter Net, Others Consider Restricting
Policies

Deciding that parents are in the best position to decide what their
children may view on the Internet, the Des Plaines, Ill., Public Library
recently installed Internet browsers on two computers located in the
children's section of the library without installing blocking software,
reports the Freedom Forum First Amendment Center at Vanderbilt University.
<http://www.fac.org/>.

In an interview with the First Amendment Center, Library Administrator
Sandra Norlin explained that "while we make suggestions on what we think
are the best sites for children, we are not the right people to be
determining each child's maturity level and each family's system of values.
Our policy is based on high regard for the people in our community and
their ability to make wise and prudent decisions for themselves."

Library officials also cited problems with filtering software in their
decision not to install it and that the software creates a false sense of
security in parents, the First Amendment Center reports.

"We felt that filtering software was not the appropriate action to take,"
Norlin said. "It's the 'one-size-fits-all' approach. =85 Everyone has the
same restrictions placed on them. No one would have the individual
opportunity to make their own decisions."

Meanwhile, in Virginia Fairfax County officials this week proposed a policy
which would allow parents of children under age 13 to prohibit their
children from using the Internet in public libraries.  Library officials
claimed that the policy may be the only solution since they cannot arrive
at a consensus on the filtering issue.

Under the policy being considered by the county's library board, a child's
parents or guardians would have the right to notify the library system that
they did not want him or her to be given access to the Internet. Children
13 and older still would have unrestricted access.

Other local libraries in the Washington, D.C. area are also considering
whether to install filtering software.  However, the Loudoun County library
board, which voted in July to install screening software on all computers
is reconsidering the policy.

Last month, the San Jose, Ca., City Council overwhelmingly rejected a
proposal that would have mandated restriction of Internet access in public
libraries, however, neighboring local counties are continuing to consider
filtering proposals, Ann Brick, a staff attorney with the ACLU of No. Ca.
said.

Filtering software is particularly problematic because it often blocks a
much wider spectrum of speech than legally obscene speech, Brick said,
adding that the decision to filter runs counter to the Supreme Court
decision in Reno v. ACLU from this year.

"The Supreme Court in Reno v. ACLU held that the Internet, as much as the
books and newspapers found in our public libraries, is entitled to the very
highest level of First Amendment protection which means that Internet
censorship in the library off limits for government, including City
Councils," she said.

Subject: File 6--Gullibility Virus Warning

********************************************************************
            WARNING, CAUTION, DANGER, AND BEWARE!
            Gullibility Virus Spreading over the Internet!
********************************************************************


WASHINGTON, D.C.--The Institute for the Investigation of Irregular
Internet Phenomena announced today that many Internet users are becoming
infected by a new virus that causes them to believe without question every
groundless story, legend, and dire warning that shows up in their inbox or
on their browser.  The Gullibility Virus, as it is called, apparently
makes people believe and forward copies of silly hoaxes relating to cookie
recipes, email viruses, taxes on modems, and get-rich-quick schemes
[perhaps conspiracy theories should be included here].

"These are not just readers of tabloids or people who buy lottery tickets
based on fortune cookie numbers," a spokesman said. "Most are otherwise
normal people, who would laugh at the samestories if told to them by a
stranger on a streetcorner."  However, once these same people become
infected with the Gullibility Virus, they believe anything they read on
the Internet.

"My immunity to tall tales and bizarre claims is all gone," reported one
weeping victim.  "I believe every warning message and sick child story my
friends forward to me, even though most of the messages are anonymous."

Another victim, now in remission, added, "When I first heard about Good
Times, I just accepted it without question.  After all, there were dozens
of other recipients on the mail header, so I thought the virus must be
true."  It was a long time, the victim said, before she could stand up at
a Hoaxees Anonymous meeting and state, "My name is Jane, and I've been
hoaxed."  Now, however, she is spreading the word.  "Challenge and check
whatever you read,"  she says.

Internet users are urged to examine themselves for symptoms of the virus,
which include the following:

      *  the willingness to believe improbable stories
         without thinking

      *  the urge to forward multiple copies of such
         stories to others

      *  a lack of desire to take three minutes to check
         to see if a story is true

T. C. is an example of someone recently infected.  He told one reporter,  "I
read on the Net that the major ingredient in almost all shampoos makes your
hair fall out, so I've stopped using shampoo."  When told about the
Gullibility Virus, T. C. said he would stop reading email, so that he would
not become infected.

Anyone with symptoms like these is urged to seek help immediately. Experts
recommend that at the first feelings of gullibility, Internet  users rush to
their favorite search engine and look up the
item tempting them to thoughtless credence.  Most hoaxes, legends, and tall
tales have been widely discussed and exposed by the Internet community.

Courses in critical thinking are also widely available, and there is online
help from many sources, including

      *  Department of Energy Computer Incident Advisory
         Capability at
              <http://ciac.llnl.gov/ciac/CIACHoaxes.html>

      *  Symantec Anti Virus Research Center at

      *  Datafellows Hoax Warnings at
              <http://www.Europe.Datafellows.com/news/hoax.htm>

Those people who are still symptom free can help inoculate themselves
against the Gullibility Virus by reading some good material on evaluating
sources, such as

      *  Evaluating Internet Research Sources at
              <http://www.sccu.edu/faculty/R_Harris/evalu8it.htm>

      *  Bibliography on Evaluating Internet Resources at
              <http://refserver.lib.vt.edu/libinst/critTHINK.HTM>

Lastly, as a public service, Internet users can help stamp out the
Gullibility Virus by sending copies of this message to anyone who forwards
them a hoax.

Subject: File 7--Bandwidth Turnabout: Not Just Fair Play But Future Wave?

The readers of CuDigest might be interested in the latest service offered
by my ISP (that I have not yet explored or signed up for.)

We read how the telco's are complaining that Internet users are eating
excessively into their bandwidth because the average net connection lasts
longer than the average "wail mail" voice phone call.

It seems that some ISPs have a different opinion in the matter. They've
started to shift their excess data bandwidth to become value-added
long-distance providers.

It makes one wonder about the "accuracy" of the telco claims.

Islands in the Clickstream:
      The Voice of the Computer


I was disappointed when hour-long cartoons of Peanuts were made for
television. I had been reading the comic strip for years, and when I read
the words in balloons above the characters. heads, I heard their voices
inside my head as a kind of echo -- the way you probably hear .my. voice
inside your head as you read these words.

That voice -- private, well-modulated, always just right -- was replaced by
a real child.s voice that didn.t sound right at all. It sounded like a
child, a real child, not the Charlie Brown in my head.  By providing too
much information, the movie makers yanked Peanuts from the world of
imagination and turned it into one more concrete thing in the world of
sensation, a fetish stripped of its magical properties.

Computer engineers pay close attention to the world of sensation as they
struggle to develop computers that act like human beings. They more they
try, however, the more it seems they miss the mark. Artificial intelligence
and robotics experts design crabs that scuttle around their labs like
low-grade idiots. Few laypeople are excited when a robot distinguishes a
cube from a ball and lifts it off the ground.

The best robots are designed for tasks, not to look like living creatures.
Let them do their jobs, and we.ll provide the personality.

A decade ago, Joseph Weizenbaum of MIT became upset when an employee
interacted with ELIZA, the simple interactive .therapist. he designed,  as
if ELIZA were a real person.. His employee even asked him to leave the room
so she could have a private conversation.

Weizenbaum was alarmed at the ease with which people projected personality
and presence onto the computer. He thought it was bad, instead of just
what.s so. Now two men from Stanford -- Byron Reeves and Clifford Nass --
have carried out some wonderful studies that reveal how and why we respond
to computers as if they are real people (.The Media Equation: How People
Treat Computers, Television and New Media like Real People and Places. -
Stanford and Cambridge: 1996).

Their studies state the obvious, but -- as usual -- it was so obvious, we
missed it. Our brains evolved to help us survive, and we react,
unconsciously and automatically, as if something that looks or acts like a
person IS a person. Our .top-level. program may say something else --
.it.s only a movie,. for example, when we.re frightened during a horror
flick -- but that wouldn.t be necessary if we didn.t think it was real.

Artificial intelligence and virtual reality are not necessary to make us
think a computer is smart. Less is more. Too much detail, too much
information, overwhelms our imaginations.

Computers are inherently social actors, Nass said at a Usability
Professionals Association conference. He used flattery as an example.
.We.re suckers for flattery, even when we know it isn.t true.. So computer
programs that flatter the user are consistently judged to be smarter and
better at playing games, and users enjoy using them more. And  ... people
ALWAYS deny that.s what they.re doing.

We act the way we act, not the way we think we act.

We need friends, we need allies, Nass explained, and when they tied blue
armbands around both users and computers and said they were a team, the
users believed their computers were friendlier, smarter, better, just as we
do about our human team-mates. Again, no one knew they were doing it.

The voices of our computers -- the ones we hear in our heads -- are always
just right. If designers simply provide the opportunity for projection and
facilitate the transaction in a seamless way, we.ll do most of the work and
add emotional richness and content. Get in the way too much, it.s like that
little paperclip guy on Windows programs, always in your face. I don.t know
anyone who wants that animation dancing on their screen all the time like a
fly you can.t swat.

The Infocom interactive text games from the 1980s were powerfully
evocative.  Games like Trinity, A Mind Forever Voyaging, and Hitchhiker.s
Guide to the Galaxy used clever text and poetic imagery to invite us to
co-create landscapes as magical as those I remember from children.s books.
With larger platforms and memory devices, games evolved into interactive
movies that shut down that process. When graphics dominate the interface,
there.s less room for the activity of the imagination.

Children imagine so much,  Eleanor Roosevelt observed, because they have so
little experience. As our experience grows, the magical landscapes of our
childhood vanish, replaced with interstate highways, convenience stores and
power lines. A little more imagination and a little less information
wouldn.t hurt. It gives our souls some room to maneuver. If  computers
provide just enough cues to elicit our projections, we.ll do the rest.
We.ll endow distributed networks, human and non-human alike,  with
personality, presence, and intentionality as the ancient Greeks saw gods in
every rock and grove and thunderstorm.

Cyberspace is .space. indeed, brimful of gods and goddesses, angels and
demons waiting to become flesh. That.s neither good nor bad, it.s just
what.s so. Digital deities are emerging now in the brackish tidewaters of
cyberspace, where all life begins. If  we accept responsibility for
understanding how we co-create them, how we interact with the Net and the
entire universe unconsciously and automatically, then we can cooperate with
how our brains work anyway.  They make up the game whether we want them to
or not. .Out there. and .in here. are metaphors, defining preconditions of
perception as .space.. The grid is imaginary, and the grid is real. That.s
the playing field of our lives so we might as well learn the rules, then
work and play with gusto and be all used up when the game is done.

 From--Marc Hurst <mhurst@fastlane.ca

 Eugene Kashpureff, known for his redirect of the NSI web page,
 was apprehended this morning in Toronto by undercover RCMP
 detectives.

 Pending a deportation hearing, he will be returned to New York to
 face Felony Wire Fraud charges that were sworn out against him
 after he had settled out of court with NSI in regard to their
 civil suit.

 Early in the week Eugene relinquished control of the Alternic to
 an adhoc industry group and that group will be making an
 announcement in the next few days.

 A this time I have no further information to volunteer.

 Sincerely
 Marc Hurst
