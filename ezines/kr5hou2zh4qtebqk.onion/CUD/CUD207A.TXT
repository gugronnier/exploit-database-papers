Miscellaneous comments
++++++++++++++++++

1. MAIL: A few people have received up to TEN copies of a single issue. We
have no idea why. On occasion, we send out duplicates if the mailer
indicates a net-block. Copies go out about 8-10 at a time, and if one batch
is returned, which happens most often on weekends, we repeat the addresses
in that batch individually, so it may happen that some people receive a
duplicate (we have no way of knowing which address caused the failure, so
we re-send all in that batch). However, there is no reason that we, or our
postmaster, can determine that would cause multiple copies to be received.

2. Most recipients on the mailing list will notice that the "TO" header
line is not to their address, but to "tk0jut1." Some people have asked how
(and why) we do this. We simply use the BCC (blind carbon copy) command.
For those asking what kind of system we use, it's an IBM Amdahl, wylbur on
the front end, and, yes, we do wish we had Unix.

3. CENSORSHIP: The article on censorship will be in issue 2.08 along with
an excellent article by Jim Warren on "Political Activity and Computers."
