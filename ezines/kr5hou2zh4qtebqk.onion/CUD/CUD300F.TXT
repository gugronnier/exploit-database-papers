Subject: Kevin Mitnick ejected from DEC Meeting
Date: Wed,  2 Jan 91 19:30:48 PST

The December 24 edition of COMMUNICATIONS WEEK has an interesting article
on page 18 by Anne Knowles.  Quickly . . . DEC caught a fellow by the name
of Kevin Mitnick trying to register to attend their DECUS user group
meeting in Las Vegas.  According to the article he (Mitnick) is a well
known hacker who is currently on probation after having been found guilty
of breaking into Easynet.  Apparently someone recognized him while he was
registering.  They apparently barred him from the meeting and DEC is now
figuring out how to address any future attempts by "hackers" to get into
their meetings.  The article said they threw someone out of a meeting a
couple of years ago for hacking during the meeting.   One wonders exactly
what was being hacked during a training meeting!  The article says DEC
supplies networked terminals for for use by attendee's.

                     "Naperville man pleads innocent"
             From: CHICAGO TRIBUNE, Jan. 4, 1991, sect II p. 3
                            By Joseph Sjostrom

A former employee of Spiegel Inc. pleaded innocent Thursday to computer
fraud and other charges in connection with the alleged theft of thousands of
dollars worth of cash and credits from the company.

Michael H. Ferrell, 34, of Naperville, entered the plea before Du Page
County Associate Judge Brian F. Telander, who set the next hearing for Jan.
31.

Ferrell was indicted on Dec. 10 by the Du Page County grand jury on four
counts of computer fraud, three counts of theft and three counts of
forgery. The computer fraud indictments charge him with using computerized
cash registers in Spiegel stores on four occasions between November 1989,
and September 1990, to issue $5,451.41 in credits to his Mastercard,
American Express and Spiegel's charge cards.

The theft and forgery indictments charge that he took $22,673 in cash from
the company. He allegedly generated vouchers and other forms, some of them
at the Downers Grove and Villa Park stores, that described services
performed for Spiegel by equipment renters and printers. However, those
services had never actually been performed, and Ferell pocketed the money
that Spiegel payed for the services, according to the indictments.

Ferrell worked for Spiegel from 1981 until he was fired last Oct.  24, said
a company spokesman. Ferrell was a support services manager for the
company's catalog and outlet store operations, the spokesman said.

Ferrell was the second person charged in December by the Du Page County
state's attorney's office with the illegal use of a computer. The other
defendant was charged with computer tampering for allegedly gaining access
to computer programs in a Naperville software firm where he worked,
although he was not charged with profiting financially from the alleged
intrusion.
