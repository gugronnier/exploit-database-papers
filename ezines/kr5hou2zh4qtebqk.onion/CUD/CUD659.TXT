0. Introduction

Dear netizens,

I am gathering information on California government sources
of electronic information that are currently available to
the public, either by means of the Internet (ftp, gopher,
email, www, etc.), or by direct dial to a bulletin board
system. The most recent compilation follows. Sources of
electronic information such as these continually change and
evolve. Please send corrections, additions and comments to:
Chris Mays <cmays@sfsu.edu> 496 Fairbanks Avenue, Oakland CA
94610. I will periodically update the list.

I assume all responsibility for errors and omissions. Please
distribute this list freely, with proper credit. This file
can be found at cpsr.org by anonymous ftp at
ftp.cpsr.org:/cpsr/states/california/940615.cal_gov_info_FAQ
(Login: anonymous, Password: (send Internet address)), or
via listserv and gopher. Those of you with Mosaic or Lynx
can access the list via World Wide Web at URL:
http://www.cpsr.org/cpsr/states/california/
940615.cal_gov_info_FAQ. If you do not have access to these
technologies, email Chris Mays <cmays@sfsu.edu>, and I will
forward you a copy of the list.

This list was compiled for the California Electronic
Government Information (CEGI) Project, with the support of
Computer Professionals for Social Responsibility, the
California Library Association Government Publications
Round Table, and help from subscribers to the calgovinfo
list. To subscribe to calgovinfo, send email to:
listserv@cpsr.org, Subject: none, message: subscribe
calgovinfo <your name>

The point of collecting this information is to:

 o Make the availability of these resources more widely
known.

 o Start people thinking about what they want to see online,
and how they want to retrieve it.

 o Create a demand for a larger list.

 o Applaud those state and local agencies and organizations
who are providing electronic information services, and prod
the rest.

I will check the resources I hear about. Please make it easy
for everyone by mentioning, if possible, the:

 o Name of the agency/organization, and where it fits into
the structure of government. For example, if you have a
gopher address for the Office of Information Technology,
remind me that the OIT is part of the Department of Finance,
which is a cabinet-level department. It would be helpful to
know the formal, informal and acronymic names.

 o Name of the friendly, knowledgeable manager in charge of
the resource, and how to contact her. Beyond contact names,
I would like to know if the agency permits the public to
give it feedback on the services offered.

 o Path to the resource, including what it is (ftp,
gopher?), login, password, commands that must be issued
(e.g. California Legislative Information,
ftpmail@leginfo.public.ca.gov, Subject: none, message:
connect leginfo.public.ca.gov <carriage return> help <cr>
quit <cr>), directories of interest, phone number, speed and
settings for BBS's, etc.

 o Nature of the information, perhaps in abstract form, so
that I can write a sentence or two describing it, or borrow
yours.

 o Dates of coverage. Note if the information source is an
archive of past postings, documents or records, or just
carries the latest.

That being said, I guess I'd like to hear rumors of gold in
the hills, too, so send them along, and I'll check them out.

Thanks,

1. New in this edition

I will list the new entries at the top of the list, and
again in the body of the list.

I will make this document 60 characters wide, and end each
line with a carriage return, to keep the formatting readable
for certain systems. Thank you Joan Loftus for the
suggestion. Barbara Newcombe asks that the entries be dated
and more terse. I welcome your feedback.

                 Help create public space in cyberspace.
      Prevent the NII from becoming simply an electronic shopping mall.

  An unprecendented coalition of nonprofit, educational, arts, service,
  labor, civil rights, consumer, public broadcasting, religious, community,
  public interest, civic, and cultural organizations are working to get
  Congress to designate a public lane on the information highway.

  Toward this goal, an important new bill has just been released that
  would open up media and communications networks to a wide range of
  information and service providers. S. 2195 would ensure that television
  and other media will have democratic and diverse offerings for the
  public in the next decade.

  But in the face of tough odds, the coalition needs _your_ help.

PUBLIC RIGHT-OF-WAY LEGISLATION (S. 2195)

        Senator Daniel Inouye (D-HI), Chairman of the Communications
Subcommittee of the Senate Commerce, Transportation and Science
Committee, has introduced important legislation to require the
reservation of capacity on advanced telecommunications networks
for non-commercial educational and informational services and
civic discourse.

        Telecommunications infrastructure legislation is generally
believed to have the potential to transform education, self-governance,
civic discourse and artistic expression.  However, this promise will
not be fulfilled unless there is a guaranteed right-of-way for the
public to share non-commercial educational, cultural, civic and
informational services.  Senator Inouye's legislation seeks to address
this problem by reserving up to twenty percent of the capacity on
advanced telecommunications networks for use by state and local
governments, educational institutions, public broadcasters, libraries
and nonprofit organizations organized for the purpose of providing
public access to noncommercial, educational, informational, cultural
civic and charitable services. The legislation is not, however,
intended to cover the Internet.  Nor is it intended to cover point
to point telephone communications that are not intended for the public.

        While many people contemplate that at some point in the future
there will be ample capacity on these "switched" networks so that
technological and economic barriers to access would disappear, this bill
would insure such uses in the interim.  If and when adequate capacity is
available, the legislative requirement to reserve space would be phased
out or terminated.  The legislation also includes a funding mechanism to
give those entities for which the capacity is being reserved sufficient
economic support to use the capacity.

        Absent legislation, the telecommunications industry is
unlikely to provide adequate, affordable, non-discriminatory access
to communications networks, and could potentially control the ideas
and information we all now receive and send over computer networks.
Information technologies are already having a profound impact on the
way we communicate with each other, keep abreast of and disseminate
important information, educate ourselves, receive health care, expand
our cultural horizons, and engage in political and civic discourse.
Politicians and members of the telecommunications industry have all
recognized the potential of the "information superhighway" expand the
delivery of noncommercial educational services and contribute to a
new era of democratic self-governance and to enrich the lives of
those people that have traditionally been left out.  Senator
Inouye's legislation will provide the mechanism for the information
superhighway to realize these goals.

        We need to support public right-of-way legislation.  We encourage
you to begin lobbying efforts by writing letters to your Senators
immediately.

* Please write your Senators as soon as possible on this urgent matter.
  If you can, also write Senator Inouye and Senator Hollings.


The Honorable [your senator]
___ Senate ________ Office Building
Washington, DC 20510

Dear Senator ____________:

We are writing to encourage you to support the legislation
(S.2195) introduced by Senator Inouye to provide space for
non-commercial uses on the "information superhighway." We
hope that you will recognize the importance of this
legislation and consider becoming a co-sponsor.  Congress must
ensure that as the legal landscape for the provision of
telecommunications services changes dramatically, those
organizations committed to providing informational,
educational, cultural and charitable services to the public
are not left out.

Congress has an historic opportunity to shape the nation's
communications system for the future.  But the promise of
economic development, educational reform and enhanced
democracy will not happen if the new technologies are
utilized principally for home shopping and movies on demand.
It is crucial that any such legislation provides for the
reservation of capacity for open, non-discriminatory use by
state and local governments, libraries, schools,
public broadcasters, and other nonprofit entities. [If
applicable, please state potential uses for your
organization.]

Sincerely,

The Honorable Daniel K. Inouye
Chairman, Subcommittee on Communications,

Dear Mr. Chairman:

We are writing to commend your efforts to ensure that space
is provided for non-commercial uses on the "information
superhighway."  We support your proposal (S.2195) regarding
the reservation of capacity and hope that your proposal will
be considered simultaneously with the Senate's debate on the
broader telecommunications reform bill, S. 1822.

provides for the reservation of capacity for open, non-

The Honorable Ernest F. Hollings

Dear Mr. Chairman:

We are writing in support of legislation (S.2195) introduced
by Senator Daniel Inouye to ensure that space is provided for
non-commercial uses on the "information superhighway."

You have been a leader in telecommunications reform efforts.
Senator Inouye's important legislation would advance your
objectives by insuring that the information superhighway
provides more than home shopping and movies on demand.  We
hope that you will help ensure that S.2195 is included in the
current debate on telecommunications reform and considered
contemporaneously with S. 1822.

I can't speak for Bryce, but my understanding of his reasoning when I
sent him private email agreeing with and supporting his position is
that today, "eglatarianism" usually means a government requirement for
identical results, not equality of opportunity.

Forcing "cyberspace" to become some kind of vast new government
entitlement will be destructive -- more destructive than the visions
of "information robber barons" dreamed up by those who seem to be
advocating such a government entitlement.

Furthermore, if design of the "information superhighway" is dumbed down
to make sure the lowest common denominator can get the full value of it
with no learning curve, then what of value will be left?

I certainly don't understand from Bryce's message any intention to do
anything to keep people out.  Those who can summon up the motivation to
learn to use the "infobahn" will do so.  Those that just want results
without putting a shred of effort into obtaining the results will have
less success.  It is always so.

Make it easier to use, yes, but not at the expense of limiting
its power and functionality.  Don't dumb it down.

And *definitely* don't turn it into some kind of welfare-statist
entitlement where making a profit is forbidden.  That will turn it
into the information equivalent of Cabrini-Green.
