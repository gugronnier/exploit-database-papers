Subject: File 1--Correction on THE WELL Access

We inadvertently reported in #4.11 that The Well (Whole Earth
'Lectronic Link) in Sausalito, Calif., was available through ftp.
This is not correct. The Well is accessible through TELNET
(192.132.30.2). We are told that it can also be reached through
well.sf.ca.us, although this address doesn't seem to work on some
systems.

It remains correct that The Well is perhaps the best system in the
country, if not the world. It is inexpensive, rich in diversity and
content, and intellectually stimulating.  The voice phone for those
wanting more information: (415) 332-4335 (9 am to 5 pm PST).

Subject: File 2--Readers Reply: "Bury Usenet" (CuD, #4.09)
From: Steve Elias <eli@CISCO.COM>

As the one who created alt.dcom.telecom after one of my
"disagreements" with Patrick regarding the telecom digest, I've got
three things to say:

1 -- Patrick decided not to post some articles I submitted, but mostly
those that had quotes from an anonymous source inside US Sprint.
Other articles i submitted, without anonymous sources, he did usually
post.

2 -- I also agree with nearly everything Steve Steinberg wrote in his
"Bury Usenet" article.  I think usenet usually sucks wind, hence i
*usually* ;) decline to participate in the net.  But don't allege that
the net should be completely "abolished" or "buried".  I have mostly
"buried usenet" from my own point of view, because the benefits to me
are not worth any effort and time i might put into posting articles,
and the real-life penalties for stating controversial views can be
substantial.

3 -- gnu not usenet.

Subject: File 3--Readers Reply: Sidetracked--Yet Another Usenet Problem (4.09)

One of the big problems I've always found with Usenet is the fact
that a good, productive discussion can be side tracked by any user
that wants to.  Or, more usually, a person can unintentionally do so.

For example, the discussion of "Bury Usenet" has now been side-tracked
and is a debate over whether or not the Telcom Digest moderator is
biased.

For example, the countless discussions on many newsgroups where one or
two grammar (or spelling) queens will kill a productive thread by
pointing out typos.

[I'm trying not to add to the problem here, so let me bring it directly
back to "Bury Usenet"]

Solutions have been attempted:  Moderated newsgroups, which many people
have problems with; and "experts only" newsgroup, which doesn't stop
people from asking how to delete a file called "-f" on a Unix system.
Neither works as well as some would wish.

The one solution that works is to avoid (uhhh, should I say "bury")
Usenet and use a standard mailing list.  There are a few really high-
quality mailing lists out there that don't get advertised.  One is
for system administrators that use NNTP, rather than users.  It avoids
unwanted conversation because it's hidden from people that shouldn't
know about it.  Another example is the problem that all of the activism
forums on the net are bombarded with pro/con arguments rather than
discussions that aid the activist's work itself.  Recently there have
been two mailing lists created where the topic is not "Who's right?"
but "We're pooling resources, giving advice, and helping each other."

I hate to say it, but if the quality of either of those mailing lists
drops too much, I will create a new mailing list under a new and more
secret name and start over.


Given a topic you can create two forums.  One talks about the topic,
one has a goal of achieving that topic.  The problem with Usenet is
that all newsgroups are created to be the later, but turn into (or
users later assume it is) the former.  The written proposal for
soc.motss dictates that it is for gay, lesbian and bisexual Usenet
members to discuss gay, lesbian and bisexual life AND it explicitly
prohibits discussions about if homosexuality/bisexuality is right or
wrong.  Amazingly enough, homophobes post enough messages each day to
make the newsgroup useless to many people.


Future directions:
Sometimes I think that I'd be willing to pay for a service where I could
explain my likes and dislikes and they would pre-scan netnews for me
and mark anything I would find interesting; I could skip all the rest.
This might be worth-while for certain ultra-high volume newsgroups.

Then I think that it might be better to pay some highly trained
individual to go through my newsfeed as it arrives and add a new
header to each message that would list five to a hundred and five
keywords from the official Library of Congress keywords list [i.e.
synonyms are removed; you don't look in the card catalog under "Movies",
you look under "Films"] so that a killfile would have a better fighting
chance.

Then I start to think about the first mailing list I was ever on.  Our
VAX at school wasn't on any networks yet, but someone in a silly mood
created the "SMC" mailing list and started sending people joking
invitations saying that they were invited to her "Secret Mail Club."

Maybe the SMC was going in the right direction the whole time.

Subject: File 4--CUD Archives Have Moved

The Computer Underground Digest archives have moved!  For a number of
reasons, including decreasing disk space, the archives at Widener have
found a new home at the Electronic Frontier Foundation.

Everything looks the same, and over a dozen new items are available,
including Phrack 37.  FTP to ftp.eff.org (presently with the IP
address of 192.88.144.4, but keep in the habit of using the name), and
go to the directory pub/cud.

My thanks to the folks at the EFF for their aid & assistance.

A copy of the present Index appears below.  Please send offers of
submissions (not the submissions themselves) to cudarch@eff.org.

Thanks,
Brendan

Subject: File 5--The FBI initiative


   102nd Congress
   2nd Session


                      Amendment  No.
                      Offered by M.


1.   SEC. 1. FINDINGS AND PURPOSES
2.   (a)    The Congress finds:
3.      (1) that telecommunications systems and networks are often
4     used in the furtherance of criminal activities including
5     organized crime, racketeering, extortion, kidnapping, espionage,
6     terrorism, and trafficking in illegal drugs; and
7       (2 ) that recent and continuing advances in
8     telecommunications technology, and the introduction of new
9     technologies and transmission modes by the telecommunications
10    industry, have made it increasingly difficult for government
11    agencies to implement lawful orders or authorizations to
12    intercept communications and thus threaten the ability of such
13    agencies effectively to enforce the laws and protect the national
14    security; and
15      (3) without the assistance and cooperation of providers of
16    electronic communication services and private branch exchange
17    operators, the introduction of new technologies and transmission
18    modes into telecommunications systems witout consideration and
19    accommodation of the need of government agencies lawfully to
20    intercept communications, would impede the ability of such
21    agencies effectively to carry out their responsibilities.
22




1   The purpose of this Act are:
2      (1) to clarify the duty of providers of electronic
3   communication services and private branch exchange operators to
4   provide such assistance as necessary to ensure the ability of
5   government agencies to implement lawful orders or authorizations
6   to intercept communications; and
7      (2) to ensure that the Federal Communications Commission,
8   in the setting of standards affecting providers of electronic
9   communication services or private branch exchange operators, will
10  accommodate the need of government agencies lawfully to intercept
11  communications.

12    SEC. 2.    Title II of the Communications Act of 1934 is amended
13   by adding at the end thereof the following new sections:
14       "Sec__.  GOVERNMENT REQUIREMENTS
15       "(a) The Federal Communications Commission shall,
16    within 120 days after enactment of this Act, issue such
17    regulations as are necessary to ensure that the government
18    can intercept communications when such interception is
19    otherwise lawfully authorized
20      "(b) The regulations issued by the commission shall:
21        "(1) establish standards and specifications for
22         telecommunications equipment and technology employed by
23         providers of electronic communication services or
24         private branch exchange operators as may be necessary
25         to maintain the ability of the government to lawfully
26         intercept communication






1          "(2) require that any telecommunications
2         equipment or technology which impedes the ability of
3         the government to lawfully intercept communications and
4         and which has been introduced into a telecommunications
5         system by providers of electronic communication
6         services or private branch exchange operators shall not
7         expanded so as to further impede such utility until
8         that telecommunications equipment or technology is
9         brought into compliance with the requirements set forth
10        in regulations issued by the Commission;
11         "(3) require that modifications which are
12        necessary to be made to existing telecommunications
13        equipment or technology to eliminate impediments to the
14        ability of the government to lawfully intercept
15        communications shall be implemented by such providers
16        of electronic communication services and private branch
17        exchange operators within 180 days of issuance of such
18        regulations; and
19         "(4) prohibit the use by electronic communication
20        service providers and private branch exchange operators
21        of any telecommunications equipment or technoloqy which
22        does not comply with the regulations issued under this
23        section after the 180th day following the issuance of
24        such regulations.
25    "(c) For the purposes of administering and enforcing
26     the provisions of this section and the regulations






1      prescribed hereunder, the Commission shall have the same
2      authority, power, and functions with respect to providers of
3      electronic communication services or private branch exchange
4      operators as the Commission has in administering and
5      enforcing the provisions of this title with respect to any
6      common carrier otherwise subject to Commission jurisdiction.
7      Any violation of this section by any provider of electronic
8      communication service or any private branch exchange
9      operator shall be subject to the same remedies, penalties,
10     and procedures as are applicable to a violation of this
11     chapter by a common carrier otherwise subject to Commission
12     jurisdiction, except as otherwise specified in subsection
13     (d).
14     "(d) In addition to any enforcement authorities vested
15     in the Commission under this title, the Attorney General may
16     apply to the appropriate United States District Court for a
17     restraining order or injunction against any provider of
18     electronic communication service or private branch exchange
19     operator based upon a failure to comply with the provisions
20     of this section or regulations prescribed hereunder.
21     "(e) Any person who willfully violates any provision
22     of the regulations issued by the Commission pursuant to
23     subjection (a) of this section shall be subject to a civil
24     penalty of $10,000 per day for each day in violation.
25     "(f) To the extent consistent with the setting or
26     implementation of just and reasonable rates, charges and



1      classifications, the Commission shall authorize the
2      compensation of any electronic communication service
3      providers or other entities whose rates or charges are
4      subject to its jurisdiction for the reasonable costs
5      associated with such modifications of existing
6      telecommunications equipment or technology, or with the

   DIGITAL TELEPHONY AMENDMENT
   (report language)


Significant changes are being made in the systems by which
communications services are provided.  Digital technologies,
fiber optics, and other telecommunications transmission
technologies are coming into widespread use.  These changes
in communications systems and technologies make it increasingly
difficult for government agencies to implement lawful orders or
authorizations to intercept communications in order to enforce
the laws and protect the national security.


With the assistance of providers of electronic communication
services, these technological advances need not impede
the ability of government agencies to carry out their
responsibilities.  This bill would direct the Federal
Communications Commission (FCC) to issue standards ensuring
that communications systems and service providers continue
to accommodate lawful government communications intercepts.
The regulations are not intended to cover federal government
communications systems.  Procedure already exist by which
the Federal Bureau of Investigation amy obtain federal agency
cooperation in implementing lawful orders or authorizations
applicable to such systems.  Further, there would be no
obligation on the part of the service providers or any other party
to ensure access to the plain text of encrypted or other encoded
material, but rather only to the communication in whatever form
it is transmitted.  It is thus the intent and purpose of the
bill only to maintain the government's current communications
interception capability where properly ordered or authorized.
No expansion of that authority is sought.




   ANALYSIS



Subsection 2(a) and (b) would require the Federal Communications
Commission (FCC) to issue any regulations deemed necessary to
ensure that telecommunications equipment and technology used
by providers of electronic communications services or private branch
exchange operators will permit the government to intercept
communications when such interception is lawfully authorized.
The regulations would also require that equipment or technologies
currently used by such providers or operators that impede this
ability until brought into compliance with the regulations.
Compliance with FCC regulations issued under this section would
be required within 180 days of their issuance.

Subsection 2(c) provides that the Commission's authority to
implement and enforce the provisions of this section are the same
as those it has with respect to common carriers subject to its
jurisdiction.

Subsection 2(d) would give the Attorney General the authority to
request injunctive relief against non-complying service providers
or private branch exchange operators.

Subsection 2(e) provides civil penalty authority for willful
violations of the regulations of up to $10,000 per day for each
violation.

Subsection 2(f) would permit the FCC to provide rate relief to
service providers subject to its rate-setting jurisdiction for
the costs associated with modifying equipment or technologies to
carry out the purposes of the bill.

Subsections 2(g), (h), and (i) require the Attorney General
to advise the Commission regarding the specific needs and
performance criteria required to maintain government intercept
capabilities, require the FCC to ensure that the standards and
specifications it promulgates may be implemented on a royalty-
free basis, and authorize the Attorney General to require that
particular Commission rulemaking proceedings to implement the Act
be closed to the public.

Subsection 2(j) provides definitions for key terms used in this
section.

Subject: File 6--Sun Devil FOIA Ruling (CPSR suit)

U.S.. District Judge Thomas Hogan today upheld the decision of the
Secret Service to withhold from public disclosure search warrant
materials associated with the agency's controversial Operation Sun
Devil investigation.  Ruling from the bench in a Freedom of
Information Act lawsuit filed in Washington by Computer Professionals
for Social Responsibility (CPSR), the judge accepted the government's
contention that release of the requested documents would interfere
with the Secret Service's ongoing investigation of alleged computer
crime.

CPSR had argued that disclosure of the documents -- search warrant
applications, executed warrants and inventories of seized property --
would not hamper legitimate law enforcement interests.  The Sun Devil
raids were conducted in May 1990 in 13 cities across the country and
have not, to date, resulted in any indictments.  Similar documents are
routinely available from judicial clerks' offices and are considered
to be public records.

While noting that the government has not alleged a conspiracy in the
Sun Devil investigation, the judge ruled that the requested documents,
when viewed in the aggregate, might reveal heretofore undisclosed
aspects of the investigation and hamper the government's efforts.
Such a "compilation" of information, according to the judge, would be
likely to interfere with the investigation -- the standard the
government must meet to justify the withholding of law enforcement
records under the FOIA.

CPSR plans to appeal the ruling to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the
District of Columbia.
