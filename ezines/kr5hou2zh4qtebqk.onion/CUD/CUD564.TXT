Subject: File 1--Has the EFF SOLD OUT?!?

The Electronic Frontier Foundation has been co-opted by the
telecommunications conglomerates and has, as a consequence, lost it's
integrity and credibility. Or so some critics would have us believe.
Especially since the re-organization of The EFF, allegations that they
have "sold out" by accepting contributions from telephone
companies--or worse, that EFF now is implicitly in the employ of
telephone companies--persist.  This allegation seems not only
unfounded, but does a disservice to the cybercommunity by falsely
maligning the integrity of one of the two (CPSR being the other) most
active and effective organizations working to establish and preserve
the rights of the electronic realm.

Because I am a dues-paying member of EFF and have recently sent my
subscription fee to CPSR, I am not a dispassionate observer. Both
groups are effective, and--even when in disagreement, I respect the
goals and strategies chosen by each group. Therefore, as a member of
EFF, I'm troubled by some of the public commentary I've read on
Usenet, BBSes, and public access systems that continue to
irresponsibly tarnish the integrity of EFF with false allegations.

Some of the basis for criticism rests on rumors. Perhaps some derives
from malice. But, the bulk may simply be a lack of information about
EFF's funding sources and an imperfect understanding about the
relationship between funders and recipients and the obligations that
relationship entails. I see nothing *inherently* improper about EFF
(or any organization) accepting funds from organizations whose goals,
ideology or practices may not overlay perfectly with those of the
recipients.  Let's look at a few issues.

1. HOW MUCH DOES EFF RECEIVE FROM TELECOS?  According to EFF sources,
roughly eight percent of their $1.6 million operation budget comes
from telecom sources, with no more than five percent coming from a
single source.  Fiscal ratios change, and whether the exact sum is
seven or 11 percent matters nil.  This is a useful chunk of resources,
but hardly substantial. It is certainly not a sufficient amount to
cause a crisis if it were withdrawn. The remainder of EFF's resources
are reported to derive from private donors, membership fees, and
revenue-generating activities (such as sales of t-shirts).  Both in the
Usenet discussion group (comp.org.eff.talk) and in its newsletters,
EFF has been open about its funding sources and has never concealed or
minimized contributions by corporate donors, including telecos.
Therefore, EFF's alleged ethical malfeasance does not lie in failure
to conceal its funding resources.  Nor does it lie in a dependency
relationship with the donors.

2. WHAT OBLIGATIONS DOES EFF OWE THE TELECOS? The broader question
here centers on what obligations a donor might expect from the
recipient. It is hardly unusual for organizations to accept funds from
contributors whose interests overlap. Examples include contributions
by R.J. Reynolds tobacco and The Playboy Foundation to the ACLU to--as
a personal example--my own former funding by the National Institute of
Justice.  Does the ACLU support freedom of speech because it is funded
in part by those with a commercial interest in protecting it?  Should
the ACLU abstain from taking a position on smokers'/non-smokers'
rights because of funding sources?  Should I have refused federal
funding lest I be accused (as I once was) of being little more than a
paid lackey of federal police and social control interests? Criticism
of EFF for its funding sources and suspicion of the strings that might
be attached extend into the lives of many of us.  However, it is rare
that general donations require any substantive changes in the behavior
or principles of recipients. It is also common for well-endowed donors
to spread their largess to a variety of groups with ends often
(seemingly) antithetical to each other and even to the donor.

There is no evidence whatsoever that EFF has changed its direction to
satisfy donors. In fact, the recent re-organization at EFF, however
much some of us might be disappointed by the emphasis, is fully
consistent with their original policy statement. In fact, a careful
reading of the founding EFF statement and its recent public policy
formulations indicate that the re-organization was primarily
structural rather than the reflection of a new philosophy. As the
CPSR/EFF/ACLU coalition in the 2600 Magazine Washington Mall incident
of 1992 suggest, the EFF continues to involve itself with those types
of issues that led to its founding. And, as Mike Godwin's continued
involvement with EFF and his willingness to help those in need of
legal advice attest, EFF remains the first resource most of us think of
when we seek computer-related legal assistance.  Those who know Mike
and EFF founders John Barlow and Mitch Kapor cannot, in their wildest
fantasies, imagine even the most generous donor influencing their
behavior or principles.

3. WHAT ARE THE ETHICAL/LEGAL OBLIGATIONS OF RECIPIENTS?  Federal and
state statutes, as well as various professional codes of ethics,
specify obligations that might lead to a conflict of interest. The
attorneys amongst us can elaborate on these.  However, there is
absolutely no evidence that the EFF approaches even the strictest
conflict of interest threshold. Its coincidental interests with
telecos involve policy and legislation affecting primarily the
development of an "information highway" and the attendant technology.
The EFF is not litigating on behalf of any telecos, it is not
(according to EFF sources and their documents) serving in a client
relationship with them, and it is engaged in no activity that--at
least by any apparent logic--could be construed to place the EFF in a
conflict of interest situation.  EFF's initiative and perseverance in
the Steve Jackson Games litigation would seem prima facie evidence
that the EFF is committed to principle and not to funding expedience.

There is room for considerable intellectual disagreement over the
focus, goals, and organization of EFF, CPSR, and, I suppose, even CuD.
But the one issue that is indisputable is the integrity, commitment,
and credibility the EFF possesses.  Because there is nary a soupcon of
evidence to to suggest cooptation, it's time to end this unnecessary
and destructive bickering about EFF's funding sources.

Those who have taken the trouble to follow the public policy
statements and read the EFF electronic and hardcopy newsletters, will
find nothing new in my comments. Those who do not receive the
newsletter and do not follow CuD's periodic summaries of the
activities of groups such as the EFF and CPSR might have been
influenced by rumors and misinformation. Those of us who are concerned
about the future of "cyberspace" should remember our debt to these
groups. Part of that debt means that we squelch false rumors that risk
irreparably tarnishing the reputations and subverting the effectiveness
of groups from whose actions we all benefit.

Subject: File 2--EICAR '93 conference / members' meeting

                         EICAR '93 Conference

    At a recent meeting the board of EICAR (European Institute for
    Computer Anti-Virus Research), decided to cancel the planned
    London conference this year.  I understand this is due to low
    participation in other computer security / anti-virus events this
    year.

    However, there will instead be a Members' Meeting in Hamburg
    (Germany), the proposed agenda is:
        25 November 1993
                14:00   Working Group 3 (Legal Questions) meeting
                16:00   Working Group 1 (Antivirus Technologies) meeting
                18:00   Joint Dinner

        26 November 1993
                09:00   Discussion of the Working Groups results
                11:00   Members Meeting
                13:00   Lunch

EICAR '94 Conference

    The next EICAR conference is proposed to be from 14 to 16 November
    1994 in the vicinity of London.

(Disclaimer; I am not an official spokesman for EICAR).

This is the first time I've heard anyone clarify that point.  One of my
main objections to the Clipper proposal was that once a legal tap had
been authorized, all further communications with that Clipper chip were
compromised unless the court order only released the session key.  LE
has NO NEED for the unique device key.  They legitimately need only the
session key for the lawfully intercepted communications.

These sections actually makes me feel better about SKIPJACK in general.
I kind of suspected that the real reason for secrecy was to protect LE
access.  (I'd still prefer the algorithm be made public)

Now, anyone care to speculate about the security of the LEAF itself?
This whole discussion centered upon SKIPJACK security, but I don't
recall whether the LEAF is _actually_ encrypted by SKIPJACK.  A SKIPJACK
key and a Clipper key are both 80 bits, but that doesn't mean you have
to crypt them the same way.

Smart Kards Are Coming
======================
A group of corporations, including MasterCard, Visa, Citicorp, Amex,
IBM, AT&T, Microsoft, and Apple, have formed the Smart Card Forum.
The cross-industry group will promote the use of smart-card technology
for payment, transit, health care, identification, and security
applications.
(Information Week August 9, 1993 pg 10)

Computer Snooping at the IRS and FBI
====================================
The Internal Revenue Service is implementing a $23 billion computer
modernization project that will give it online access to taxpayer
information.  In the midst of this, the GAO has revealed that as
many as 350 employees in the IRS's Southeast Region (Atlanta) have
been snooping into taxpayer records. So far, 154 have been
disciplined.

The GAO (Government Accounting Office) has also said that access to
the FBI's National Crime Information Center (NCIC) databases has
been systematically abused by law enforcement workers and associates.
Cases cited as examples include an officer using NCIC to track down
his ex-girlfriend (he later killed her), a terminal operator checking
customers for her drug-dealing boyfriend...just to be sure they
weren't undercover agents, and a dispatcher running background checks
on her fiance's political opponents. The FBI declines comment, but
the GAO has recommended that Congress make it a criminal offense to
access the network for private use.
(Information Week. August 9, 1993. pg 13)

Wipe Before Discarding
======================
A Canadian citizen, who purchased a used hard drive from a local
computer store, found himself in possession of a goldmine of personal
data and information.

The used drive contained the personnel records of every employee in
the Alberta land title offices in Edmonton and Calgary. It included
salaries, social security numbers [presumably the Canadian equivalent],
and performance evaluations. It also held lengthy, confidential memos
about plans to turn over the land title department to a private
agency.
(Information Week August 9, 1993 pg 60)

Pay Your Rent
=============
Speaking of Edmonton, Alberta...  A landlord's association there has
formed a group to share information about tenants. The online database
can be searched with little more than a name or driver's license
number.  The landlords say the primary purpose is to keep track of
people who skip out on rent payments, or damage property. They answer
concerns about discrimination by saying that anyone caught abusing
the system will be forbidden from using it in the future.

Subject: File 5--CuNews -- ("Hackers need not Apply" & more)

If It's Blurry You Shouldn't Be Watching
========================================
A patented digital technology from VideoFreedom Systems (San Diego,
CA) may be the key to getting an intrusive Congress off their
censorship bandwagon. The technology would allow television (and movie
theatres!) to blur objectionable scenes and sounds. Much the same way
the news programs can distort the voice and image of a confidential
source who wishes to remain that way. The technology would allow those
viewers who want to see "the good parts" to clean-up the image to
their tastes.  (Information Week August 16, 1993 pg 10)

Hackers Need Not Apply
======================
Information Week magazine recently conducted a "fax vote"
self-selected survey of readers. The questions asked about policies,
thoughts, and practices regarding hiring ex-hackers to help out with
computer security.  Of the those who choose to respond, 15% said they
had been approached for a job by a hacker. Only 6% said they had ever
hired a hacker to test security.  Of their concerns about doing so,
over half said "they might compromise security". About 35% expressed
concerns over "legal problems".

Some of the write-in comments included:

"Their crimes are difficult to prove and almost impossible to
prosecute.  Not only do they go unpunished, but hiring them makes
crime pay."

"What happened to our idea of ethics and morality? I don't believe
only felon hackers are smart enough to foolproof our computer
systems."

"They could sell ideas back to your competitor. These people will do
anything for a buck".

Refer to Information Week, August 16, 1993 pg 29 for full details.

This Tag Line Meets Corporate Standards
=======================================
Duke Power Company (Charlotte, NC) has issued a memo to supervisors
and managers that forbids employees from expressing their religious or
political opinions over the company's Email, voice mail, or fax
machines. The company says the memo arises out of problems with people
using 'tag lines' (short sentences at the end of messages) on the
company's Profs mail system. The company did not forbid tag lines, but
issued guidelines for their content.  According to the company few of
its 18,000 employees see the rules as a restriction of free speech.
(Information Week. August 16, 1993 pg 60)

Woodstock for Hackers and Phreaks
=================================
Newsweek magazine (Aug 16, 1993 pg 47) features a story on the End of
The Universe conference in the Netherlands. According the Information
Week's summary, the Newsweek article reports that attendees had at
least one thing in common with the Woodstock guests....they believe
that rules were meant to be broken.  (IW's summary is on pg. 64,
August 16, 1993)

Don't Copy That (Microsoft) Floppy!
===================================
Information Week reports that an article in the San Francisco paper
THE REVOLVER (Aug 9, pg 1) says some lawyers claim that Microsoft
might enjoy too much influence over federal prosecutors. It seems that
an unusually high number of cases against software pirates are
launched on Microsoft's behalf. The number is higher compared with
Lotus or WordPerfect for example.  (Information Week. August 1, 1993.

((MODERATORS' NOTE: In CuD #5.39, we reviewed the BBS Message Base
File Archive Project compiled by LODCOM. We were impressed by the
comprehensiveness of the project and favorably reviewed it as a
valuable set of documents for scholars and curious readers who are
interested in BBS "underground" culture of the 1980s.  The collection
has been expanded, and the current offerings are described below)).

++++

   Volume I of the Hack/Phreak BBS Message Base File Archive Project
has been completed. This file is 19 KB in length and contains the
Table's of Contents for each of the 20 Message Base Files. Volume II
is being compiled and is expected to be completed and sent out to
those who have ordered the Set sometime in September. Volume III is
expected to be completed in November 1993.  Should any additional
material come our way, a fourth and final Volume will be made.

   The newest version of the Order Form File will be sent to you
sometime in the next week. Should you find the following TOC's
interesting and you want to order the files do so with the NEW order
form. If you have already ordered using the old order form that is
fine, as the price change is retroactive since it is to YOUR benefit.
As you will note when you see the new order form and information file,
ALL the volumes created will cost $39.00 personal, $99.00 commercial.
That is, for the above price you receive ALL the volumes, not just one
volume. The price change was made due to the good response to the
initial order form.

   When Volume #2 is completed a file similar to this one with its
TOC's will be mailed to you. If you wish to be taken off this mailing
list just say so.  If not, Lodcom will continue to keep you up to date
on the projects' progress.  Disseminate this File as you see fit.

   If you have any questions feel free to email us anytime.
