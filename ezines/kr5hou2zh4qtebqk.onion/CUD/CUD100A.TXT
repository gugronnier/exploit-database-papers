COMPUTER UNDERGROUND DIGEST is an open forum dedicated to sharing
information among computerists and to the presentation and debate of
diverse views.
--------------------------------------------------------------------
DISCLAIMER: The views represented herein do not necessarily represent the
            views of the moderators. Contributors assume all responsibility
            for assuring that articles submitted do not violate copyright
            protections.
--------------------------------------------------------------------


COMPUTER UNDERGROUND DIGEST was begun with the encouragement of Pat Townson,
moderator of TELECOM DIGEST. Pat received far to many responses to the recent
Legion of Doom indictments to print, and many of the issues raised were, for
reasons beyond Pat's control, unable to be printed. This, the initial issue of
CuD (as in "stuff to ruminate over") will reprint some of the initial
responses to provide the background for those who missed the earlier
discussions.

Preliminary interest in this forum has been relatively good. We received about
50 inquiries in the first 12 hours. We anticipate initial problems in linking
bitnet with usenet and other outlets.  Doug Davis (in Texas) has thoughtfully
volunteered to serve as a go between between Usenet and other links, so, by
trial and error, we'll try to contact everybody who has expressed interest.

We will set line length at 78 characters. If there are problems in reading
this, let us know and we will shorten it.

STATEMENT OF INTENT

CuD encourages opinions on all topics from all perspective.  Other than
providing a context for an article if necessary, the moderators *will not* add
commentary of agreement or disagreement.  We see our role as one of
facilitating debate, although we will undoubtedly take part in discussions in
separate articles.

From the inquiries, interest seems to gravitate around a number of issues
related to the "computer underground," by which we mean the social world of
phreaks, hackers, and pirates. Judging from the comments, we encourage
contributions of the following nature:

1. Reasoned and thoughtful debates about economic, ethical, legal, and other
issues related to the computer underground.

2. Verbatim printed newspaper or magazine articles containing relevant
stories. If you send a transcription of an article, be sure it contains the
source *and* the page numbers so references can be checked. Also be sure that
no copyright violations are infringed.

3. Public domain legal documents (affidavits, indictments, court records) that
pertain to relevant topics. In the next issue we will present documents from
the Alcor (California) E-mail law suit.

4. General discussion of news, problems, or other issues that contributors
feel should be aired.

5. Unpublished academic papers, "think pieces," or research results are
strongly encouraged. These would presumably be long, and we would limit the
size to about 1,500 lines. Those appropriate for distribution would be sent as
a single file and so-marked in the header.

Although we encourage debate, we stress that ad hominem attacks or personal
vituperations will not be printed. Although we encourage opinion, we suggest
that these be well-reasoned and substantiated with facts, citations, or other
"evidence" that would bolster claims.

CuD *is not* a preak/hacker forum, and it is not a replacement for PHRACK
magazine.  However, our initial model for this forum is a combination of
PHRACK WORLD NEWS and CNN's Cross-Fire if moderated by Emo Phillips.

The first few issues are exploratory. If there is continued
interest, we will continue. If not, so it goes. We *strongly*
encourage suggestions and criticisms.

===  Computer Underground Digest - File 1 of 5  ===
===================================================


Welcome to the first "issue" of Computer Underground Digest.  Jim and I
thought it would appropriate if we both wrote a few words as a sort of "hello"
and introduction. I'll keep this brief for now as I believe the "good stuff"
will be found in the other inclusions.  However since this is the first of
what could be several (or perhaps few) issues it is appropriate at this time
to offer some thoughts, more or less off the cuff, on the so-called "computer
underground" (CU).

Over the past few years I've often been asked to justify the use of "computer
underground" when referring to the realm of hackers, phreakers, and pirates.
Certainly the "computer" part is easy to justify, or at least accept as valid.
No, it's the "underground" that has been criticized.  Now I certainly don't
claim to have invented the term, in fact it is taken from the vocabulary of
the p/hackers themselves.  However "underground" does imply, at least in
common usage, some characteristics that are not necessarily accurate.  Some of
these are organization, criminality (or at lest marginality), unity, and
purposiveness.

Does the CU display these characteristics?  Discussing each would take much
more room than I intend to use today.  My M.A. thesis of August 1989 addressed
the issues of organization and unity, from a sociological viewpoint.  The
articles included in this issue of the Digest address all of the a fore
mentioned issues from another viewpoint, one formed largely by cultural
outsiders.  The issue that faces us now is who gets to define what the CU is
all about? Do we rely on the Federal Justice department to identify and label
the intent, organization, and purpose of the CU as conspirical?  Do we rely on
the media to define the CU as reckless and unlawful?  Do we, as citizens,
trust those in power to make decisions that will forever impact the way our
societal institutions of control approach those whose application of
technology has out paced our conceptions of private property and crime?

Am I an advocate _for_ the computer underground?  No, I'm not "one of them"
and I don't speak for "them".  However I do think it is in the best interest
of all if the "problem" of the CU is approached from the new perspective it
deserves.  If our society is to ultimately decide that CU activity is every
bit as terrible as puppy-whipping then that decision should be made, not
forced upon us by lawmakers (and others) who are assuming, from the very
beginning, that CU activity is threatening and criminal.

To this end I hope that the CU Digest can provide information and discussion
from a variety of perspectives.  The assumptions and changes in definitions
are subtle but hopefully we can begin to get a handle on many aspects of the
CU.

==============================================================================

Recent media depictions of phreaks, hackers, and pirates have created an
image of evil lads (is it *really* a male bastion?) out to wreak havoc on
society (the studies of Erdwin Pfuhl and Ray Michalowski, Dick Hollinger and
Lonn Lanza-Kaduce, and Meyer and Thomas). Hollinger and Lanza-Kaduce have
argued that one reason that Draconian anti-computer abuse laws were passed in
the past few years is because of distorted images, lack of understanding of
the computer world, and a lack of a strong constintuency to point out the
potential abuses of restrictive legislation. We see CuD as an antidote to the
current--yes, I will call them WITCH-HUNTS--of law enforcement agents and
media hysteria. There is also a perceived need of commentators with some
sympathy toward the computer underground to preface their comments with "I
don't agree with their behaviors, but. . ."!  I see no need to adopt a
defensive posture. All predatory behavior is wrong, and that type of
disclaimer should be sufficient. However, it remains to be seen whether *all*
computer underground activity is as predatory as the media and law enforcement
agents would have us believe. Yes, crimes are committed with computers. But,
crimes are also committed with typewriters, cars, fountain pens and--badges.
Computer Underground digest will attempt to provide an antidote to current
beliefs by creating an open forum where they can be debated by all sides.

Our intent, as Gordon indicates, is not to serve as apologists, but rather as
gadflies. Technology is changing society faster than existing norms, values,
beliefs, or laws, can match, and by airing issues we hope to at least provide
insights into the new definitions of control, authority, privacy, and even
resistance.  Data from our own studies indicate that sysops of some BBSs have
been exceedingly cautious in putting up documents that are quite legal. The
sysop of one of the world's largest legitimate BBSs has told us of the
chilling effect on freedom of speech that even a casual visit from the FBI can
produce. Our hope is to present facts, stimulate debate, and above all, to
create an awareness of the relationship between the computer underground,
which is currently a stigmatized passtime, and the rest of society.  We are
not concerned with changing opinions, but we do hope to sharpen and clarify
what, to us, are highly complex issues for which there is no simple solution.
