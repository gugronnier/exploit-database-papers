In reality, the CHRISTMA EXEC was reposted to *Usenet*, not Bitnet.  While
some Bitnet sites are part of the Usenet, they are by no means one network.
In addition, the original CHRISTMA EXEC incident involved the entire
Bitnet, not just IBM's internal mail system.

By the way, it would have been far more accurate to refer to CHRISTMA EXEC
as a trojan, rather than a virus........

Its method of replication is to send copies of itself to every entry in the
user's NAMES files; Unix users can think of NAMES as an alias file.  It
does NOT infect entire systems; it only acts on the virtual machine of the
user who executes it.

I don't think we'll see much more of this one.  It was posted to a
low-volume newsgroup on Usenet.  A reader of that newsgroup would also
require access to a BITNET site in order to implement the trojan.

Note that the file MUST be sent via SENDFILE; the headers placed on
electronic mail render it useless unless someone strips off the headers and
executes it.

True enough; I strongly suspect that most RSCS handlers now look for and
eliminate any files named CHRISTMA EXEC........8)

A word of warning: IBM users should be extremely cautious of *ANY* EXEC
that simply appears in their reader.  I have heard reports of several
variations on this theme; anyone with a good knowledge of CP and CMS can
imagine some nasty possibilities.
