((MODERATORS' NOTE: The Cincinnati BBS raids strike us a witch hunts.
The following document gives us no reason to change our minds.  The
raids seem consistent with the current mood of some prosecutors,
politicians, and others, to ride the "anti-porn" hysteria).

                      STATEMENT OF THE CASE

      15.       A computer bulletin board system, like CCC, stores
         information  in  a  central computer and  allows  subscribers  to
         access that information via telephone lines and personal computer
         equipment.   By  means of a computer bulletin board,  subscribers
         can   converse,  communicate  and  exchange  various   types   of
         information  with  each  other as well  as  retrieve  information
         stored on the bulletin board itself.

      16.       Plaintiff has been operating CCC since 1982 and has
         developed a list of monthly subscribers numbering in the
         thousands, who pay a set fee for access to the bulletin board.
         CCC offers its subscribers the ability to send and receive
         electronic mail (hereinafter "e-mail"), to participate in on-line
         discussion groups, to utilize and download software, to engage in
         computer games, and to receive newspapers and periodicals of
         general as well as highly specialized interest.  Included among
         the various information and service options offered to
         subscribers of CCC is non-obscene adult oriented material.  This
         category of material represents approximately three (3) percent
         of the total informational material and resources offered by CCC
         to its subscribers.  Access to the non-obscene adult oriented
         material on the CCC bulletin board is restricted to a limited
         number of adult subscribers who requested such access.
      17.       Commencing sometime prior to June 16, 1995, defendants,
         under color of state law and pursuant to and in their official
         capacities for and on behalf of their respective jurisdictions,
         conspired together and with others unknown, and therefore not
         named as defendants, to violate plaintiff's rights and privileges
         guaranteed to him by the First, Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments
         of the United States Constitution, the First Amendment Privacy
         Protection Act, and Title II of the Electronic Communications
         Privacy Act by designing and implementing a campaign
         characterized by harassment, express and implied threats of
         criminal prosecution, and mass seizures of computer equipment and
         information.  This campaign was initiated by defendants for the
         purpose of causing plaintiff, and others, to cease transmitting
         and/or receiving non-obscene adult oriented material via computer
         technology.

      18.       Sometime on or about June 16, 1995, pursuant to and
         part of this campaign, defendants, under color of state law,
         sought a search warrant authorizing the search of all computer
         equipment and accessories necessary for the operation of CCC and
         authorizing the wholesale and indiscriminate review of all
         computer electronic communications transmitted to and from
         plaintiff and CCC's subscribers including, but not limited to, e-
         mail and personal correspondence that was stored in or exchanged
         in electronic form by means of CCC's equipment and software.  At
         the time defendants made application for the aforementioned
         search warrant, defendants knew or should have known that no
         reasonable grounds existed to believe that the contents of the e-
         mail and personal correspondence sought were relevant or material
         to any on-going criminal investigation.
      19.        On  June 16, 1995, pursuant to and part  of  this
         campaign,  defendants,  under color of state  law,  obtained  and
         executed a search warrant providing for the search of plaintiff's
         personal  residence  for all computer equipment  and  accessories
         necessary  for the operation of CCC as well as for all electronic
         communications   transmitted  to  and  from   CCC's   subscribers
         including, but not limited to, e-mail and personal correspondence
         that  was  stored in or exchanged in electronic form by means  of
         CCC's equipment and software.

      20.        As a further part of this campaign, following the
         execution of the aforementioned search warrant, defendants seized
         and  physically removed from plaintiff's residence virtually  the
         entire  inventory of computer equipment and accessories owned  by
         plaintiff and necessary for the operation of CCC.  Included among
         the  numerous equipment and accessories seized by defendants were
         computer hardware, video display units, printers, software,  data
         drives, and internal or external information storage units.  As a
         consequence of defendants' actions in removing the aforementioned
         computer equipment and accessories, defendants necessarily seized
         information  transmitted  to and from CCC  and  its  subscribers,
         including,  but not limited to, e-mail and correspondence  stored
         or  exchanged  in electronic form.  As a further  consequence  of
         these  actions defendants seized plaintiff's entire inventory  of
         non-obscene adult related material as well as all other forms  of
         expressive material.

      21.       At the time defendants sought, obtained, and executed
         the aforementioned search warrant and seized all of the computer
         equipment and accessories related to the operation of CCC, as
         well as much of the information provided by CCC to its
         subscribers which was contained in such equipment, defendants
         knew or should have known

        i.             that items seized included work product and
           documentary material containing mental impressions, conclusions
           or theories of individuals who authored or created such materials
           for the purpose of disseminating same to the public;

        ii.       that the information seized included e-mail and
           personal correspondence transmitted to and from plaintiff and
           CCC's subscribers;
       iii.      that the information seized included expressive
           material protected under the First and Fourteenth Amendments to
           the United States Constitution that cannot be seized without a
           prior judicial determination of probable obscenity;

        iv.       that the mass seizure of this computer equipment and
           information would have a devastating impact on the plaintiff's
           business;

         v.        that the mass seizure of this computer equipment and
           information would prevent plaintiff from transmitting any
           information, including expressive material protected under the
           First and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States
           Constitution;

        vi.       that the search warrant under which authority
           defendants ostensibly based their actions did not by its terms
           authorize the seizure of any materials or information;

       vii.      that there were less intrusive means of obtaining the
           information defendants sought to inspect for potential violations
           of state law, and that such means, if utilized, would have
           permitted  plaintiff to continue to use and derive the economic
           benefit of his computer equipment;

      viii.          that there were less intrusive means of obtaining
           the information defendants sought to inspect for potential
           violations of state law, and that such means, if utilized, would
           have permitted  plaintiff to continue to receive and transmit
           constitutionally protected speech;

        ix.       that there were less intrusive means of obtaining the
           information defendants sought to inspect for potential violations
           of state law, and that such means, if utilized, would have
           preserved the privacy interests of plaintiff and his subscribers
           in the e-mail and personal correspondence that was stored in or
           exchanged in electronic form via CCC's equipment and software;
           and

         x.        that it was not necessary to physically seize and
           remove the information sought or any of the computer equipment
           owned by plaintiff because defendants at all times were capable
           of retrieving or "downloading" information exchanged or stored in
           plaintiff's computer equipment and by such means preserving said
           information for any legitimate law enforcement purpose determined
           by defendants.
      22.       Defendants' activities were conducted purposefully, in
           bad  faith,  in  conscious and reckless disregard of  plaintiff's
           federal and constitutional rights to privacy, to free speech, and
           to  be free from unreasonable searches and seizures, and with the
           intention to intimidate plaintiff from his continued exercise  of
           free   expression  and  to  impose  a  prior  restraint  on   the
           transmission  of presumptively protected forms of  expression  by
           plaintiff and others by permanently removing from circulation non-
           obscene  adult  oriented and other forms  of  expression  and  by
           physically  removing  and retaining the  computer  equipment  and
           software  by  which  computer-generated forms of  expression  are
           transmitted.

      23.       As a direct and proximate result of defendants'
           actions, as previously described, plaintiff has suffered and will
           continue to suffer damage to his business and professional
           reputation in the following regards

         i.             plaintiff has lost the use of computer equipment
           valued at approximately $45,000.00;

        ii.       plaintiff has been forced to replace computer equipment
           at the cost of approximately $45,000.00;

       iii.       plaintiff has lost revenue from subscribers in the
           amount of approximately $28,000.00 per month;

        iv.       plaintiff has suffered a temporary and permanent loss
           of a portion of his subscriber base;

         v.        plaintiff has lost good will associated with the
           operation of a legitimate and lawful computer service; and
        vi.       plaintiff has been prevented from transmitting
           presumptively protected material to his subscribers.

      24.        Further, unless defendants are preliminarily  and
           permanently  enjoined from continuing to engage in a campaign  to
           intimidate plaintiff, to chill the exercise of his constitutional
           rights, and to impose a prior restraint upon the distribution  of
           presumptively  protected  forms  of  expression,  plaintiff  will
           continue  to  suffer  violations of  his  constitutional  rights,
           thereby incurring irreparable injury for which plaintiff  has  no
           adequate remedy at law.

          KYL AND LEAHY TO INTRODUCE ANTI-HACKER BILL


   (Washington, D.C.) -- Senator Jon Kyl (R-AZ) and Senator Patrick
Leahy (D-VT) will introduce a bill next week that responds to the
rapidly increasing sophistication of computer crime by criminalizing
and toughening penalties for a host of computer security violations.

    The bill makes it a felony for a hacker to inflict reckless damage
on a computer system. It also makes it a felony for an authorized user
to inflict intentional damage on a computer system. And it criminalizes
cases where individuals threaten to crash a computer system unless
access and an account are granted.

   "Our national infrastructure, the information that bonds all
Americans, is not adequately protected," Kyl said. "This bill will
make criminals think twice before illegally gaining access to computer
files.

   "We have a national anti-stalking law to protect citizens from
harrassment, but it doesn't cover the equivalent of stalking on the
communications network. We should not treat these criminals differently
simply because they injure us in other ways."

   Reports demonstrate that computer crime is on the rise. The
Computer Emergency and Response Team (CERT) at Carnegie-Mellon
University found computer intrusions have increased from 132 in 1989
to 2,341 in 1994.

   A report commissioned last year by the Department of Defense and
the CIA states "[a]ttacks against information systems are becoming
more aggressive, not only seeking access to confidential information,
but also stealing and degrading service and destroying data."

   Current law punishes only those who trespass AND adversely affect
the use of a government computer. The bill treats viewing information,
even when no theft or damage occurs,  as a criminal offense. In this
situation, privacy and security have been breached.

    "The system administrator in these cases must spend time, money,
and resources to restore security," Kyl said. "We can no longer accept
trespassing into computers and viewing information as incidental just
because the information isn't stolen or damaged."

   The "Kyl/Leahy National Information Infrastructure Protection Act
of 1995"  adds a statute to allow prosecutors to fight interstate and
foreign transportation of stolen computer files.  And it ensures that
repeat computer crime offenders are subject to harsher penalties.

Subject: File 3--Computer Porn Conviction: New Thought Control (fwd)

---------- Forwarded message ----------
From--bc880@freenet.toronto.on.ca (Marcus Shields)
Subject--Computer Porn Conviction--New Thought Control

Internet users- particularly those in Canada- concerned about government
attempts to "crack down on Internet perverts" should take careful note of
the following article exerpted from the Toronto Star newspaper:

COMPUTER PORN CONVICTION A FIRST

A 20-year old Mississauga man will be sentenced July 20 for
creating and distributing child pornography on a computer
bulletin board.

It is the first reported conviction under Canada's two-year-old
kiddie porn law involving computer production and distribution.

"The materials are pretty disgusting, _but_at_this_stage_they're_
_all_his_fantasy,_all_the_workings_of_his_perverted_mind",
(emphasis added) assistant crown attorney Philip Enright said of
Joseph Pecchiarich, 20.

<snip>

..."What he would do is take his scanner and run the scan over a
totally innocent picture of a child, say a 5-year old girl
modelling a bathing suit," Enright explained.

"Then, when it was transposed on to his screen, with the software
that he had on his computer he was able to remove the clothing
and add genitalia and then he would put the child in a sexually
provocative position."

<snip>

So, there we have it, fellow Canadian computer users; merely
harbouring thoughts of having sex with children is now an offense
that will be zealously tracked down by the police and prosecuted
to the fullest extent of the law.

Now, the fascinating thing about the Pecchiarich case, in eerie
similarity to the recent Eli Langer "obscene art" prosecution in
Toronto, is that in both these cases of alleged "child pornography",
there is one rather minor (pun intended) missing element. To wit,
CHILDREN. If you will cast your mind back to the situation several
years ago when the Mulroney government passed the "child pornography"
law (over the bitter objections of the civil liberties lobby, and
virtually without serious debate in Parliament, partly because it
was near the end of the session but mainly because even the NDP had
been cowed into silence by overwhelmingly conservative public
opinion), the entire premise upon which this law was passed was, "to
protect children from sexual abuse".

But in both the Peccharich and Langer cases, no children- indeed, no
living beings of any kind- were involved at any stage of the process.
What these individuals WERE prosecuted for, is publicly expressing
thoughts that conservative society abhors- to wit, child sexuality.
Now, I'm strongly against the PRACTICE of children being involved in
sexual conduct, too- but, if we accept the idea that merely
communicating an idea that society doesn't like can be subject to
criminal prosecution, where do we draw the line? Suppose Peccharich
had used his computer to retouch a picture of Mila Mulroney so she
appeared to be in bondage? What if he doctored a picture of Jean
Chretien or Bill Clinton so it appeared that Bill or Jean had been
assassinated? Why is it OK for society to punish someone for
publishing thoughts of deviant sex, but not OK to punish someone for
imaginary depictions of murder? (Time to pull _True_Lies_ from the
video store, I guess.)

Well, you might want to discuss this issue with your fellow Net
users.

As long as doing so is still legal in the eyes of the police.

"Computer Privacy Handbook", Andre Bacard, 1995, 1-56609-171-3, U$24.95/C$31.95

After the three prior works on PGP and related issues, Bacard's book
reads like a popular magazine article.  Unfortunately, this is not
necessarily an advantage.

Part (chapter?) one is a general overview of privacy as related to
computers.  The examples and arguments used, though, are chosen from
such a broad spectrum that they actually weaken the position in favour
of privacy and confidentiality.  Most of the anecdotes relayed in the
book have little to do with computers.  The majority have to do with
governmental or corporate activities over which the individual has no
say.  None bear on the function of PGP (Pretty Good Privacy) -- to
encrypt local files and, in particular, those sent over public email
channels.

Chapter two discusses encryption in general terms.  *Very* general
terms.  There is no attempt to grasp or present any technical material
here.  This prevents Bacard from noting the silliness of statements
that "high-quality crypto" is "impossible" to break, or that methods
of attack have not been publicly identified.  First, this sounds
suspiciously like "security by obscurity".  Second, an awful lot of
people *do* know how to break PGP -- and they know exactly how long it
will take.  (By the way, it was Ken Follett, not the Germans, who used
"Rebecca" as a code key.)  The discussion of ITAR (the International
Traffic in Arms Regulation of the US government) does not provide
enough detail to explain the difficulties Phil Zimmermann faces, nor
the problems in getting PGP overseas.  The coverage of Clipper,
however, is excellent.

The overview of PGP given in chapter three is a fair enough
description, but completely avoids touching on Zimmermann's
difficulties with the US federal government or RSA Data Security.  The
pointers on how to get PGP are useless unless you want to buy
ViaCrypt's version.  The US sites all have limitations, and usually
some form of authentication before you can access the files.  The
international versions are illegal in the US because of patent issues.

Chapter four is documentation for the commercial version of PGP.

While the Stallings (cf. BKPRTPRV.RVW), Garfinkel (cf. BKPGPGAR.RVW)
and Schneier (cf. BKEMLSEC.RVW) works are written by technical experts
and contain technical background, they are not impossible for the
layman to understand.  This work, therefore, fails in a number of
respects, and brings little to the subject which has not been said
before.
