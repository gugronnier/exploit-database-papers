***  CuD #3.20: File 7 of 7: How to get WATCH.EXE                ***
********************************************************************

Because of a misunderstanding, readers were invited to receive a
UUencoded version of Eric Smith's Watch program directly from his
mailbox at PORTAL.  Readers may receive a UUencoded version of the
program and brief documentation from the CuD ftp site.  It is assumed
that users who can manage the ftp will also have a uudecoding program.
Therefore, the program is provided in uue format only, not in the
BASIC format offered in the article.  [The BASIC code required to
create the Watch archive was over 70k long.  The uue file is about 12k!]

Eric Smith also notes:

     Some users of FluShotPlus and PRODIGY have questioned if
     PRODIGY was disabling FSP's actions.  They base this fearon
     the fact that under PRODIGY, FSP's "+" indicator is missing
     from the upper right corner of the screen.  "+" indicates
     that FSP is loaded and is active.  A "-" indicates that FSP
     is loaded but has been deactivated.  HOWEVER, these users
     are forgetting that PRODIGY operates in a graphics screen
     mode, while FSP is a text-mode program.  Thus, FSP IS
     writing the "+" or "-" in the corner of the screen, but the
     character is either not visible of has been reduced to a few
     lit pixels, rather than a full character.

     Users of FSP can confirm that it is still loaded and active
     by removing one of the PRODIGY files from the FLUSHOT.DAT
     file.  When PRODIGY accesses that file, users will see a
     smudge of pixels light in the middle of their screens and
     will hear FSP's alarm go off. While it is technically
     possible for PRODIGY to "jam" a tsr's operation, there is
     absolutely no evidence that PRODIGY is doing this.

     As I note in the docs to Watch, the program is useful for
     watching any program's behavior.  It is in no way restricted
     to calls performed by PRODIGY: the behavior it monitors is
     used by all DOS applications.  For most purposes, you will
     not want a record of the DOS calls.  Therefore, the "write
     calls to the screen" version is the more appropriate.
     Writing to the screen certainly is faster than "log to a
     disk file" method: open the log file, write the information
     to that file, and then close the file.  The latter method is
     only appropriate or necessary when you wish to preserve a
     record of a program's behavior or when you are unable to
     view the screen (as when the screen is in graphics mode).

It normally takes a few days to get a program up to the ftp sites,
so wait a few days before trying, or contact the moderators.
