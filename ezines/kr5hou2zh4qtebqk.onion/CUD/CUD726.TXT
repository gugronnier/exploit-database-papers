Supreme Court Justices Express Concern About Computer Privacy;
Opinions Suggest Mounting Interest on Nation's Highest Court

For IMMEDIATE RELEASE
March 1, 1994

A majority of the justices of the U.S. Supreme Court, ruling in a criminal
evidence case, today suggested that they had serious concerns about the
potential invasion to individual privacy raised by the nation's increasing
reliance on computer technology.

In a series of opinions in a case from Arizona about whether evidence
seized by the police because of a computer error could be used during
trial, the justices raised questions about the impact of computers,
particularly on law enforcement.

"Although we believe the Court ruled incorrectly in deciding that the
evidence could be used during trial, I think the majority opinion is quite
narrow," said Steven Shapiro, ACLU Legal Director. "The more lasting
significance of the case," he added, "may be that a majority of the Court
seems quite troubled by the risk that computer technology poses to
personal privacy.

"In particular," Shapiro said, "a majority of the Court was clearly
unwilling to create a new and broad exception to the Exclusionary Rule
whenever government officials violate the Fourth Amendment based on a
computer error."

In his majority opinion for the Court, Chief Justice Rehnquist reversed a
decision of the Arizona Supreme Court, which had ruled that the evidence
could not be used because it had been seized during what turned out to be
an arrest based on a mistaken warrant. Justices O'Connor, Scalia, Kennedy,
Souter, Thomas and Breyer joined the Chief Justice's decision.

But Justice O'Connor wrote a concurring opinion, which was joined by
Justices Souter and Breyer, that discussed the growth of technology and
its impact on law enforcement.

"In recent years, we have witnessed the advent of powerful, computer-based
recordkeeping systems that facilitate arrests in ways that have never
before been possible," O'Connor said. "The police, of course, are entitled
to enjoy the substantial advantages this technology confers. They may not,
however, rely on it blindly. With the benefits of more efficient law
enforcement mechanisms comes the burden of corresponding constitutional
responsibilities.

And in another brief concurring opinion, Justice Souter, who was joined by
Justice Breyer, wrote that" our very concept of deterrence by exclusion of
evidence should extend to the government as a whole, not merely the
police, on the ground that there would otherwise be no reasonable
expectation of keeping the number of resulting false arrests within an
acceptable minimum limit."

Justice Ginsburg, in a dissenting opinion joined by Justice Stevens, wrote
that "widespread reliance on computers to store and convey information
generates, along with manifold benefits, new possibilities of error, due
to both computer malfunctions and operator mistakes."

"Most germane to this case, computerization greatly amplifies an error's
effect, and correspondingly intensifies the need for prompt correction;
for inaccurate data can infect not only one agency, but the many agencies
that share access to the database," she wrote.

In a particularly "conspicuous example," Justice Ginsburg said that the
computerized databases of the FBI's National Crime Information Center
(NCIC) contain over 23 million records, identifying, among other things,
persons and vehicles sought by law enforcement agencies nationwide.

"Thus," she wrote, "any mistake entered into the NCIC spreads nationwide
in an instant."

       PEOPLE AND THEIR GOVERNMENTS IN THE INFORMATION AGE

                   NATIONAL ELECTRONIC OPEN MEETING
                            May 1-14, 1995

                    CALL FOR PUBLIC ACCESS SITES


BACKGROUND:

In recognition of the growing importance of information
technology as a means for communication and participation in
democratic government, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB),
the National Telecommunications and Information Administration
(NTIA), the National Technical Information Service's (NTIS)
FedWorld, and the National Performance Review (NPR) will be
sponsoring an electronic open meeting entitled "People and Their
Governments in the Information Age," from Monday, May 1 to
Sunday, May 14, 1995.  The US Government Printing Office (GPO)
will assist by providing telephone registration for Public Access
Sites and preconference information.

The meeting will seek to garner public opinion on the use of
information technology by Federal, State, Tribal and local
governments.  The electronic open meeting will encourage public
discussion about the respective roles of the Federal government,
State, Tribal, and local governments, industry, the public
interest and library communities, academia, and the general
citizenry in creating an electronic government.

One of the fundamental tenets of the Clinton Administration is
that government information is a public asset and valuable
national resource.  This open meeting is an extension of earlier
efforts, such as the Government Information Locator Service
(GILS) initiative, to establish a framework for governments'
roles and activities in the information age.  In early April, OMB
will publish a "Notice of Inquiry" in the Federal Register
setting forth the five topics mentioned below, referencing key
reports and other documents, and seeking comment.

Along with the traditional method of mailing in responses to a
"Notice of Inquiry," the open meeting will be conducted through
our nation's electronic networks including: the World Wide Web,
newsgroups, e-mail listservs (mailing lists), commercial on-line
providers, Public Access Sites, and dial-up bulletin board
connections.


HOW THE CONFERENCE WILL BE CONDUCTED:

FedWorld will create five e-mail discussion groups.  The five
discussion groups will also be accessible through five
corresponding Internet newsgroups, the World Wide Web, and
dial-up bulletin board connection.  Each discussion group will be
devoted to a specific topic relating to "People and their
Governments in the Information Age."  Each topic will be hosted
by one or more experts, who will provide an introductory
statement to initiate the discussion and who will also take part
in the discussion.

Attendees will participate in the conference by replying to the
hosts' introductory statements, posting statements or comments,
and by replying to the statements and comments of other
attendees.  We are seeking the broadest possible level of
participation emphasizing input from a wide spectrum of
Americans.  The open meeting will focus on five topics:


     Services -- from emergency help and health care to business
     licenses.

     Benefits -- from social security and food stamps to small
     business grants.

     Information -- from declassified secrets and travel aids to
     satellite weather maps.

     Participatory Democracy -- ensuring everyone's chance to be
     heard in a democracy.

     Technology -- how the technical portion of electronic
     government will work.


NEED FOR PUBLIC ACCESS SITES:

A primary goal of the meeting is to enable as many Americans as
possible to participate in the dialogue.  This includes people
who do not have a computer with a modem, or access to the
Internet.  In order to ensure participation by the "unconnected,"
public and private organizations are needed to volunteer as
"Public Access Sites."

The following criteria will apply to institutions interested in
serving as a Public Access Site:

     *       Willingness and ability to make computer facilities
     available, free-of-charge, to the general public on a full-
     or part-time basis throughout the two-week meeting, and to
     provide logistical and technical support to the public.

     *       Ability to access Internet e-mail, newsgroups, or
     the World Wide Web.  Public Access Sites should not use
     Telnet to access the FedWorld bulletin board.  Because the
     number of access ports at FedWorld is finite, FedWorld
     prefers to reserve dial-in and Telnet capacity for
     individuals who seek to use the FedWorld BBS as their
     primary means of participating.

     *       Willingness and ability to publicize your
     institution's participation as a Public Access Site to the
     local media and community, and answer local public and press
     questions about participation.

     *       Willingness to be listed in a national directory
     of Public Access Sites that will be made available to the
     public and press, before and during the meeting.

If your institution would like to serve as a Public Access Site,
please do one of the following:

     Point your World Wide Web browser to:

                  http://meeting.fedworld.gov

     Or, send a blank e-mail message to:

                  pas-info@meeting.fedworld.gov

In response to your e-mail, you will receive an automated
response detailing how to register as a Public Access Site. If
you do  not presently have e-mail, newsgroup, or World Wide Web
capability but plan on having such capability by the time of the
meeting, you may register as a Public Access Site or receive
general end user information by calling the GPO Access User
Support  Team at (202) 512-1530.

If you would like more information about the content and format
of the meeting, please send a blank e-mail message to
info@meeting.fedworld.gov.  You will receive an automated
response providing additional detail for the electronic open
meeting.

Thank you for your interest in making this meeting more
accessible to the public!

Subject: File 6--Sacred Cows in Cyberspace

Editor:

In CuD #7.22, George C. Smith <70743.1711@compuserve.com>  gives
a mini-review of C.Stoll's technological reactionism in the new book
"Silicon Snake Oil".

>Lasch closed his last book, "The Revolt of the
>Elites" with a biting assessment of the current mania with technology:
>
>"Those wonderful machines that science has enabled us to construct
>have not eliminated drudgery, as . . . other false prophets so
>confidently predicted, but they have made it possible to imagine
>ourselves as masters of our fate.  In an age that fancies itself as
>disillusioned, this is the one illusion - the illusion of mastery that
>remains as tenacious as ever."

Cyberspace is a visceral example of how the distinction between technology
and its creators seems to be blurring increasingly. Where does the
human end and the machine begin? What parts of our lives are "artificial
technology" and what parts are "pure human interaction" or whatever
the converse is, presuming it even exists? It seems that humanity's
very best technology is seamless and invisible and in fact basic
extensions of ourselves and our senses. The phone can be thought of as an
extension of the human vocal cord, the television an extension of
our vision and sight. And cyberspace can be regarded as perhaps the
premiere, remarkable convergence of all sense-extending technologies.

Da Vinci wrote that "man is a marvelously constructed machine."
Thoreau wondered whether it was the case that machines were the slaves of
man, or vice versa. The view that we are the masters seems to be a driving
force of 20th century reality and civilization. Cyberspace in many ways
represents the pinnacle of the religion of the deification of technology.
We are now witnessing the very first reactionary ripples against the
digital onslaught, the bold new bid for supremacy by the bits over
the atoms.

Stoll's book is only an opening volley in what will become
an intensely passionate debate over the next few years. What's so
great about this cyberspace, thing, anyway? Proponents will help
strengthen their arguments by emphasizing that the "Information
Highway" is not going to bring about Utopia in the human institutions
of business, government, education, and religion, but it holds great
promise in at least surpassing the shockingly mediocre systems we find
ourselves inheriting today.

>He also has doubtless
>alienated the cypherpunks movement by essentially stating that while
>their technical accomplishments are neat, the problem they're trying
>to solve - the preservation of information privacy through the employ
>of cumbersome, almost unusable anonymous remailers and cumbersome,
>almost unusable encryption technology - looms trivial in the global
>picture.  In fact, "Silicon Snake Oil" gores so many sacred cows in
>cyberspace it's guaranteed the author will be regarded like a
>dysenteric hog loose in the streets of Mecca on some parts of the net.

Speaking of the "cypherpunks movement" and "goring sacred cows",
I'm pleased to announce the establishment of a WWW dedicated to
the mad ravings of a notorious Internet crackpot, L.Detweiler, who
in many ways can be considered one of the earlier cyberspatial
reactionaries and satirists.

Just what exactly *is* the cypherpunk philosophy? What is "cryptoanarchy"?
Can cyberspace be used for negative ends such as brainwashing or
ulterior political agendas? What will be the effects of cyberspace
on government? Do governments invariably evolve toward
corruption? What's the difference between anonymity, pseudonymity,
and identification? Is free speech related to anonymity? What are
the political and social implications of "digital cash" or a
cyberspatial mafia? Is there such a thing as "morality" or "trust"
in cyberspace? If so, what does it entail? How should the internet
community deal with persistent crackpots?

These and other excruciatingly provocative questions have been given
the inimitable Detweilerian treatment at

http://www.csn.org/~ldetweil

(Detweiler is currently working on a disproof of Turing's halting problem
as well as finding environmentally safe and clean ways of disposing
used digital bits.)

Subject: File 7--Italian BBS returned!

PRESS RELEASE 24/3/95

Almost a month after the police seizure of the BITS Against The Empire
BBS and raids on the homes of some members of the Clinamen
Self-Managed Social Centre of Rovereto (Trent, Italy), all the
material confiscated has finally been restored to its rightful owners.

After a check of its software and hardware, the BBS was immediately
put back on-line, resuming its linkages with the Cybernet, ECN and
Fidonet networks of which it is part. Its users once again have access
to the original document archive, and steps are currently underway to
update it thanks to back-up tapes which had been stored separately
from the BBS (in the cat's basket, to be precise). The tapes were also
to be duplicated onto a PC clone in the event that the authorities had
not returned the original BBS.  This measure had been inspired less by
any bad faith on the part of the magistrates or police, and more by
their technical and social ignorance, which manifests itself every
time they come into contact with a logic different to their own:
freedom rather than control, creativity rather than conformity.
Already many sysops, in Italy as elsewhere, have had to pay the price
for what they had thought was simply a time-consuming hobby.  Those
like ourselves who consider computer networking to be rather more
important than this should not be surprised by the recent experience
of BITS Against The Empire. The complete restitution of the material
seized suggests that nothing useful was found amongst it that might
confirm the charges laid out in the authorities' original warrants. In
any case, the three magistrates who ordered the raids have been unable
to find the time to meet with us over the past 23 days; similarly, the
carabinieri who actually returned the seized goods refused to answer
any questions concerning the enquiry or its future course. Good sense
suggests that the matter will close there, but at this point no one
can rule out the possibility that in the next few weeks or months the
official charge of subversion - along with any other charges that the

Empire resumes its activities, happy to live in a democracy, but with
the back-up tapes still hidden away in the
cat's basket.
