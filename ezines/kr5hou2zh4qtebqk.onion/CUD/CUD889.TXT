Subject: File 1--Jonathan Wallace letter in re Censorship/Blocking

Dear Mr. Milburn:


I am a business executive and attorney, publisher of The
Ethical Spectacle, http://www.spectacle.org, and co-author
of Sex, Laws and Cyberspace (Henry Holt, 1996), a book
on Internet freedom of speech.

In that book, we support blocking software as a less restrictive
alternative to the Communications Decency Act. Perhaps naively,
I never imagined that companies like yours would use their
power in the marketplace not merely to assist parents in
controlling what their children see, but to block speech
which has nothing to do with your stated mission.

Your actions in blocking Bennett Haselton's Peacefire.org
site and in threatening his ISP with a total block of all
its subscribers are  extremely reprehensible and reflect very
poorly on your company. Your customers--and potential purchasers--
 deserve to have a full understanding of your company's behavior,
so that they can make informed product decisions. Effective immediately,
I am mirroring Bennett's essay "Where Do They Not Want You to Go
Today?" on my site at http://www.spectacle.org/peace.html, along
with my own essay, "Don't Buy Cybersitter." I will also be distributing
copies of this letter in the Fight Censorship mailing list
(which is read by many journalists nationwide) and in other
Internet publications.

Sincerely yours,

Jonathan Wallace

I received permission to send out a copy of the following letter, thinking
it would be interesting for some of you on the list and because this is a

From: "Scott A. Davis" <sdavis@fc.net>
Subject: File 3--EDITORIAL: Troubles On The Net...


The following is a small exerpt from an article from the Philadelphia
Inquirer and a follow-up editorial from Scott A. Davis.  Scott is the
system administrator and Editor In Chief of Banzai-Institute.org, a site
dedicated to conservative and common sense opinion and commentary on the
news.  The following article, as well as others like it can be found at
http://www.banzai-institute.org.  Scott can be reached by email at
sdavis@fc.net or sdavis@banzai-institute.org


TITLE: *** Troubles on the Net mirror those elsewhere

"Recent accounts of bogus news downloaded from the Internet, along with
fresh reports of online child pornography and cybersex leading to offline
rape and murder, make this a good time to ask:  What is going on with
this Internet thing, anyway?"

"The Internet is portrayed by turns as monstrous -- a fountain of
obscenity, hate and lies -- or as the brightest hope for democracy and
liberty, the renaissance of letter-writing, and on-demand access to the
unexpurgated wisdom of everyone from William Shakespeare to Homer
Simpson."
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
[Begin Editorial]


    Let me answer the original question "What is going on with this
Internet thing, anyway?" What is going on is that like real society, it is
becoming cluttered with idiots who have nothing better to do than to spam
the world with their commercial advertisements, upload pictures of their
latest 12 year old boy-toy or to partake in other activity that gives the
Internet a bad name.

    The Internet was developed by people who have an education level
much higher than the typical American. It was developed for the purpose of
exchanging information between researchers in educational institutions
and/or government agencies. Some years later, the Internet became
semi-public when large companies and other organizations were taking part.
This occurrence didn't do much to lower the quality of the net, as the
"new" people to come onboard had some common sense about them. These large
companies, in the eyes of many, had the same need for the Internet as did
the government and educational institutions.

    Then came the World Wide Web. While the web is a great tool and a
fantastic resource, it has...and will be, in my opinion the death of the
Internet.

    One cannot put a price on the wealth of information that the web
can produce. One can visit the Smithsonian Institution, every major
college, government agencies, et. al. And for that reason, the web won't
be going away any time soon. But the advent of the web, as well as it's
continuous use and promotion has opened the doors to placing loaded guns
in the hands of children, so to speak.

    For instance, the Philadelphia Inquirer's article goes on to say
"In an ongoing investigation that has produced 80 arrests and 66
convictions over the last three years, the FBI last week raided the homes
of Internet users suspected of downloading child pornography in 20 cities
in its crackdown on kiddie porn that is being transmitted via online
services and the Internet." And for that effort, I must say that this is
one good thing that the government is doing in respect to the Internet.

    What have people like this done for the Internet? Well, besides
cluttering my news server with pictures of six year old boys, we see or
read almost on a daily basis about attempts by the government to enact
regulation and monitoring of our revered network. And the government's
behavior and thoughts regarding this medium are at times, bloated and
fallacious.

    While these people who commit crimes using the Internet should be
punished just as if they had walked outside their front door and
perpetrated the act out on the street, they are causing some entities in
position of power and other decision makers to think that people become
more susceptible because the crime was committed with or originated with a
computer and the Internet.

    The Internet is nothing special. It is not the "new society" or
"global community" in the sense that many portray it to be. In many ways,
it is nothing more than an extension of the lives we live away from the
computer. We can't legally abduct a child while walking down the street by
luring them away from their parents with a candy bar.

    It is terribly sad, and angering at times, to see that decent,
intelligent people who use the net have been mobbed with idiots, but we
have to learn when and where to draw the line. The Inquirer's article
quoted Neal Goldsmith, social psychologist and publisher of the online
periodical BusinessTech.com as saying "Finding a better fit, a comfort
level, between people and the Internet machine will take a few years..."
Sooner or later, he says, "common sense has to prevail."

    Other items that the Inquirer's article lists that I personally
think are bad reflections on the net are:

  "In July, three Penncrest High School juniors, one of them an Eagle
Scout, were caught breaking into the chemistry lab at their school
carrying a "shopping list" of chemicals, dozens of bomb recipes and a
terrorist handbook that had been downloaded from the Internet."

    I went down to one of the local book stores here in Virginia the
other day and saw several copies of "The Anarchist Cookbook" on the shelf.
These punks could have just as easily done the same thing. Just because
information like is available on the Internet means nothing more than they
didn't have to get off their lazy asses to go to the book store and spend
their lunch money on the book, which I'm sure contains some of the same
information they obtained on the net.

  "Police say a Maryland woman, Sharon Lopatka, was killed last month by a
man she had met on the Internet who had agreed to fulfill her bizarre
request to be tortured to death."

    It takes all kinds to make the world go 'round. A match made in
heaven, evidently.

  "A Columbia University graduate student, Oliver Jovanovic, was charged
nine days ago with the sexual torture of a woman he allegedly met in a
chat room on America Online."

    Well, as Neal Goldsmith said, "common sense has to prevail."
However, it is obvious that that time is not yet upon us. There are still
stupid people in this world who do stupid things and promote stupid
misconceptions about the Internet. This story might have been printed deep
in the bowels of your local news paper had it not involved a computer. But
since these two people met over a computer, the world has the story
plastered to it's face.

  "Advice columnist Ann Landers has been airing the painful stories of
people who say that their marriages are breaking up because of online
affairs, or that finally meeting that dream cyberlover turned into a
real-life nightmare."

    ...and just like in real life, if you ain't gettin' it at home, you
gotta go elsewhere. ...and in typical fashion, let's write a cry-baby
letter to Ann Landers rather than solve the problem at home.

    The point is, the Internet is not some new-sprung,
disproportionate world. It's just another medium for the same injustices
and misgivings to take place as do in the real world. Crimes and other
unfortunate happenings should not be spotlighted because they entail the
use of a computer. That's what I think.

Parolees can be kept offline
By Courtney Macavinta
December 16, 1996, 6:30 p.m. PT

A branch of the U.S. Department of Justice today approved new
restrictions on parolees that allow judges to prohibit them from
using the Internet.

Adding to restrictions parolees already face on their travel and
association, the U.S. Parole Commission stated: "Responding to
increased criminal use of the Internet has approved the
discretionary use of special conditions of parole that would
impose tight restrictions on the use of computers by high-risk
parolees."

The Commission made the decision noting the "surge of 'how-to'
information available on the Internet and other computer online
services." The statement went on to say that the Net gives
sophisticated offenders new avenues to commit crime or forge
criminal associations.

The new restrictions would allow the parolee to get written
permission to surf the Net or get an Internet account. The
provision allows for unannounced searches of a parolee's computer
system and could require a daily computer log of the user's
activity.

                            COMPUTER ATTACKS AGAINST WEBCOM
                                          By Elizabeth Weise

AP Cyberspace Writer

SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- An computer attack against WebCom, one of
the nation's larger World Wide Web service providers, knocked out
more than 3,000 Web sites for 40 hours this weekend during the
busiest shopping season of the year.  The attack began Saturday
morning at 12:20 a.m., said Web Communications' chief operating
officer Chris Schefler from the company's offices in Santa Cruz,
Calif. Service resumed at 4 p.m. Sunday.  WebCom helps companies
and individuals set up Web sites and provides storage space on
its computer from which the sites run.

The outage was particularlyhard on retailers who promote and sell
products on WebCom-based home pages.  The attack, launched by an
unknown individual or party, blocked service by sending as many
as 200 messages a second to the WebCom server, or host computer.
This specific "denial of service" attack, known as a SYN-flood,
leaves the computer unable to respond to the flood of messages,
which queue up and eventually render it unable to function at
all.

 December 11, 1996

 By Terence Gallagher

     BONN, Germany (Reuter) - German Chancellor Helmut Kohl's cabinet aapproved
 an Internet regulatory bill Wednesday that seeks to protect users' privacy  and
 keep out smut and Nazi propaganda.

    With its ``multimedia law,'' Germany is forging ahead with a project that
the United States and other governments have largely given up as impossible
controlling the content of the Internet without compromising civil
liberties.

     Cyberspace ``is not a law-free zone,'' Education and Research Minister
Juergen Ruettgers told a news conference. ``No one should think that special
technologies put them beyond the reach of the law.''

   The new law covers businesses such as telebanking and database services
as well as online services. It says that acts already prohibited in Germany
and conducting fraudulent business -- will also be illegal in electronic form.

     CompuServe, the world's second largest online information service, said
recently it would consider moving its German operations to a neighboring
country if the law becomes too restrictive.

   The draft law reflects German sensitivities to the confidentiality of
personal data, requiring service providers to store as little data as
possible. It also reflects the struggle between federal and state authorities
over which has the right to regulate the Internet.

    The German law puts responsibility for suspect content on ``suppliers,''
but this is not clearly defined.   Online services such as Compuserve and
 America Online could be held responsible for legally questionable material
 after being warned that such material can be accessed through their systems,
 provided they have the technical means to block it.

    The German law would pioneer the use of ``digital signatures'' -- strings
of data encrypted to establish the origin of transmitted messages. The
signatures could prevent fraudulent commercial transactions on the computer
network by matching a publicly accessible data string with a confidential
number, or key, registered with a central authority.

    Such signatures could play a major role in preventing computer crime,
Interior Minister Manfred Kanther said. The law would bar programs that track
 users' paths through the Internet, recording what sites they have visited, and
 would require the opportunity for anonymous use of the system.

   It also calls for the electronic ``tagging'' of material unsuitable for
minors, so it could be filtered out with something similar to the V-chip now
under development in the U.S. television industry.

    After consultations with state governments next week, the government
hopes the law will take effect in August 1997, ahead of the planned
deregulation of European telecommunications markets in January 1998.

"This destiny does not tire, nor can it be broken, and its mantle of
strength descends upon those in its service." - Francis Parker Yockey,
                                      IMPERIUM
