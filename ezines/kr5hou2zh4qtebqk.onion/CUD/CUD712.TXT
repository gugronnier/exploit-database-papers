If Sen. Exon's bill passes, this will be the text of the law. Items in
[brackets] are the portions that are being deleted or changed. The text
itself that is not within these brackets is how the law will look.

   (B) any access permitted -

   (i) in good faith reliance upon the lack of any
   representation by a provider of communications that
   communications provided by that provider are communications
   specified in subsection (b) of this section, or

   (ii) because a specific representation by the provider did
   not allow the carrier, acting in good faith, a sufficient
   period to restrict access to restrict access to communications
   described in subsection (b) of this section.

   (3) Notwithstanding paragraph (2) of this subsection, a provider
   of communications services to which subscribers are denied access
   pursuant to paragraph (1) of this subsection may bring an action
   for a declaratory judgment or similar action in a court. Any such
   action shall be limited to the question of whether the
   communications which the provider seeks to provide fall within the
   category of communications to which the carrier will provide access
   only to subscribers who have previously requested such access.

Here's an important bit. "Transmits or otherwise makes available" is
different from the earlier law. It DOES pleace a burden of responsibility
upon the provider of service. NOTE that unlike other portions of the law,
boths old and new versions, this part DOES NOT include the word
"knowingly". Crucial, crucial point.

No anonymous annoying! Does this mean we can't raid IRC channels anymore?
Or flame people from anon.petit.fi (sp?) accounts?

Subject: File 2--UofMich student expelled for "obscene" story on Net (fwd)

               ---------- Forwarded message ----------
From--jgull@umich.edu (Jason Gull)

The local (Ann Arbor, MI) paper ran a story yesterday regarding a
sophomore at the University of Michigan (whose name is Baker, I believe)
who was expelled yesterday (or Thursday) as a result of a story he
"transmitted on the Internet."

The story the student wrote apparently involved the brutal rape and
torture of a woman.  The name of the woman in the story is also the
name of another student on campus, which seems to have been the spark
that got the kid kicked out.  The story seems to have been in one of
the alt.sex USENET groups, because according to the paper, the story
was first brought to the attention of University officials by an
alumnus  -- an attorney in Moscow who just happened to spot the story
on USENET.  The irony of the fact that this morality-policeman in
Moscow was scouring the alt.sex groups is apparently lost on the Ann
Arbor News.

What is truly frightening, and deserving of more coverage in the news,
is that the FBI is now investigating this kid, and an agent in the
local FBI office has officially stated that they're contemplating
federal obscenity charges against him.  Remember, this isn't
pictures/video he's accused of sending, it's purely text.  (Raunchy,
disgusting text, I'm sure, but plain 'ol ASCII).

Anyone have any other news on this?  (I'll post more when I find it.)

Of course, this discussion is based on American libel law. The Net,
however, is accessible from countries with different rules.

In Canada and the United Kingdom, for example, the customary burden of
proof shifts in  defamation cases; if someone sues a newspaper for
libel in Canada, the lawyers *for the paper* must show that the
reporter and editors did no wrong -- one result of this is that the
defence of truth is used sparingly, since it necessitates providing a
legal proof of every word in a newspaper story. Libel trials are
extremely rare in Canada, perhaps because the expense of legally
proving a piece of journalism runs into the hundreds of thousands of
dollars. In addition, countries that use British common law
principles do not admit the defense of absence of malice, which is a
uniquely American idea. (Yes, we are jealous.)

My main point is that, since the Net is international, perhaps a party
who felt themselves wronged could sue for libel in a jurisdiction
where the laws are weighted more in favor of the plaintiff than is
possible in the U.S.A. (Just like recent Net-related prosecutions in
the U.S.A., in which BBS operators from one state find themselves
defending charges originating from another, generally less civilized
state.)

Some years ago a political figure in a Caribbean country brought a
libel suit againt an American television network. His lawyers brought
the suit into a Canadian court, stating that since the program had
been available to Canadian cable viewers, this was jusified (most in
Canada believed it was because of our plaintiff-friendly libel laws.)

P.S.: I am not a lawyer, and therefore unqualified to render a useful
opinion on international Net libel law. I submit this as a journalist
with some practical knowledge of libel and defamation law, and in the
hopes that you may encourage a real expert to address my
observations.

Subject: File 4--Defamation in cyberspace

In a recent exchange on this topic in CuD 7.09, Eric Eden
<R3eje@vml.cc.uakron.edu> and Henry Itkin <Henry.Itkin@UNI.edu> have
been disagreeing about burdens of proof in defamation cases. This can
be a complicated area because the actual process of the law tends to
be shortened into various "rules of thumb" such as "if you can prove
it is true you are probably not liable".

Just to clarify the process under common law (i.e. individual US state
law), roughly speaking:

1. The plaintiff (the alleged victim) in a defamation case has the
burden of proving that the defendant published a defamatory statement.
"Publisher" by the way includes the author as well as the actual
publication in which the defamation is printed. The plaintiff does NOT
have to prove that the statement is untrue. (But see discussion
below.)

2. If the plaintiff can show this first step is completed, then the
assumption is that the defendant is liable. It is now the DEFENDANT's
burden to show why he or she should not be held liable. One such
affirmative defense is "truth". That is, if he can prove that the
statements made are true then he will not be held liable.

3. Note that each state has the opportunity to alter the rules
presented above, and some US states have tougher or weaker standards.
Most US states do not change the standards due to point number 4
below.

4. If you live in a jurisdiction where the 1st Amendment to the US
Constitution applies, there is a Federal Constitutional issue which
comes into play. (Bear with me, it has been a while since law school.)
If the plaintiff (alleged victim) in a case is deemed to be a "public
figure", then he is required to prove that the defendant had actual
malice when making the statement in question. There are a number of
cases which define how public you have to be before you are a "public
figure", and I won't go into that. But assuming that the plaintiff IS
a public figure, then the matter will turn on whether he can prove
actual malice. (Hold on tight, here is where the confusion sets in.)
One method used to demonstrate actual malice is for the plaintiff to
show BOTH that the statement is false, and that the author should have
known it was false when he made the statement.

Obviously, no journalist will go through this detailed set of
calculations before writing a story. (If he asks us, of course, we do
the calculations for him). Instead, the journalist operates on a rule
of thumb that "if I can prove it's true I am probably all right". This
is a fairly cautious restatement of the standard above and will
probably help to keep people out of trouble, but if in doubt please
consult with a lawyer familiar with your own case and local law.

(If, like me, you live in a common law jurisdiction where the 1st
Amendment does NOT apply, then you need to be much more cautious than
in the US. In fact, be aware that when you post to the Usenet you are
probably "publishing" in the UK as well.)

Finally (home stretch) if the court determines that the defendant is
liable for defamation, the next question is "how much does he have to
pay". This is the question of damages. The relevant inquiry is: "how
much damage can the plaintiff show as a result of the defamatory
publication". If one were to publish allegations in the New York Times
that a stock broker is a "cheat and embezzler", then this will
probably damage the person quite a bit. If, on the other hand, you
send an e-mail to one friend alleging that your neighbour slapped you
while hanging up clothes, this will probably not generate a huge
amount of damages.

If you want to read more about it, I co-authored a piece entitled
"Multimedia Defamation" which appeared last year in International Media
Law Review. In addition, my colleague Nick Braithwaite has an article on
this subject which should be accessible on our firm's World Wide Web
server. The URL is http://www.cliffordchance.com/

Subject--Internet Censorship in Africa

Dear All,

Back in June 1994 I wrote an article (Computer Weekly June 16 1994
Computer privacy, Highway patrol) which was very critical of the creeping
censorship and government control of computer networks in the UK and USA

Since then I have been told that IT experts in Africa wishing to develop
computer networks, set up internet connections or even use a
telecommunications provider other that the state PTT face similar
obstacles from their respective governments. What's more phone calls are
routinely monitored and satillite access is restricted or at least
discouraged.

A visiting civil rights lawyer from Cameroon suggested to me that many
African governments do not want to see a proliferation of communications
mediums because they will be unable to keep track of their subjects.

I am not sure if this is true but I would appreciate details of any
overzealous African government attempts at monitoring internet traffic
or censorship of electronic communications.

If any African governments have given any justifications for the control
or censorship of electronic communications please speed the details to me!

Thanks in advance. Emmanuel Ohajah If you would like to see my article and
other research then please mail me at Emmanuel@critical.demon.co.uk

                   STILL CENSORED FROM THE INTERNET!

     Banished CPU has been -- and remains -- censored from the
Internet.  The (Canadian) CBC PrimeTime News camera crew has recently
interviewed me for 4 hours about the situation.  We are being
unscrupulously censored for politically and financially motivated
reasons.

     Here is the complete story:


     Banished CPU, a Freedom of Speech BBS, has been distributing
Holocaust Revisionist material through the Internet since 1991.  The
material addresses, in an objective manner, the question of WHAT REALLY
HAPPENED during the so-called "Holocaust".  The facts are both
"politically inconvenient" and undeniable.

     Over the years, organized Jewish pressure has succeeded in cutting
off our link to the Internet numerous times, using their traditional
methods of boycott, slander and terror.

     Netcom, a large commerical Internet provider based in San Jose,
California, served as our latest connection to the Internet for almost
a year, until they censored Banished CPU on November 26, 1994,
violating the contract they had formed with me.

     Before I signed on with Netcom, I informed them of the nature of
the material I distribute, and inquired about the level of Freedom of
Speech they offer.  I was told -- by a Netcom sales representitive who
identified herself as "Sherri" -- there would be no restrictions or
censorship of any kind, as long as the material conformed to U.S. law
(which, of course, it does.)  Agreeing to the stated terms, I paid the
initial sign-up fee and continued paying them each month for the
connection to the Internet.

     After a couple months of organized Jewish pressure, an unsigned
electronic message arrived from Netcom, informing me that I would no
longer be allowed to distribute messages in most Internet message areas
(USENET newsgroups).  The message specified only 12 newsgroups that I
would be allowed to post to, forbidding me from posting to any of the
other 7,000+ newsgroups (including many 100% appropriate newsgroups
such as soc.history!)  The message stated plainly that they were not
willing to discuss the issue.

     For months, I reluctantly obeyed the new "rule", even though it
violated the verbal contract they had entered into earlier.

     Then I distributed a Free Video Offer to a couple dozen newsgroups
outside of their arbitrary list of 12.  The video was "David Cole
Interviews Dr. Franciszek Piper", which greatly infuriated and panicked
the Holocaust Lobby.  David Cole, producer of the video, is Jewish --
NOT a "Nazi" or an "anti-Semite" by any means.  Hundreds of copies were
sent all over the world within a matter of weeks.  Requests were still
pouring in when we were abruptly cut off.

     At first, Jewish pressure tried to get me kicked off for
"profiteering" (an informal taboo on the Internet).  A lady named
Margaret from Netcom wrote to me, informing me of the complaints and
asking me to cease and desist.  In reply, I pointed out that I was not
"profiteering" by any stretch of the imagination -- I was merely giving
out free, legal copies of someone else's video, and not collecting any
money whatsoever.  Margaret wrote back, apologizing for the
misunderstanding.

     The next day, however, I discovered that our link to the Internet
was no longer functional.  I made countless long distance phone calls
to Netcom's offices in California.  I left messages with receptionists
for their managers, supervisors and technical support staff.  For eight
full days, nobody at Netcom would take or return my calls.  In the
meantime, Banished CPU's link to the outside world was cut, effectively
censoring me and all of my callers.  I discovered that Netcom was
DELETING all of my callers' mail, which was in many cases both
important and irreplaceable.

     Finally, after 8 days of silence, someone at Netcom called and
left a message on my answering machine, informing me that Banished CPU
had been cut off because I posted to newsgroups other than the 12 that
they had illegally mandated.  They violated their contract, bowing to
the Jewish demands to censor me.

     Now, almost 3 months after Netcom first censored us, I am still
unable to procure another Internet connection, even though one small
Internet provider ("Quicknet") has supposedly been trying to provide
us with a link.  According to Quicknet, some "Internet committee" or
individual (whose Internet e-mail address is root@internic.net) is
refusing to process the necessary re-registration form.  Censored we
remain.

     In the meantime, messages addressed to myself and my callers are
reportedly still being deleted by Netcom, returning no warning message
whatsoever -- giving the impression that the messages are received but
ignored.  Netcom continues in their unethical behavior, and is refusing
to speak to the CBC PrimeTime News.

     Should you wish to contact Netcom and let them know how you feel
about their unprofessional behavior, the following information may be
of some use:

in the organizations.
ComputerWorld. Jan. 30, 1995 pg.12

Spoofing and Hijacking
======================
In a related story to the above, Computerworld ran a story about
CERT's alert concerning IP Spoofing and Session Hijacking. The story
includes comments from several security specialists, who express
concern about continued attacks of this type.
ComputerWorld. Jan. 30, 1995 pg.12

InfoTerrorism
=============
Sure, hackers are a problem, but what are you going to do about high-
tech military-style assualts on your datacenter? The miltary-industrial
complex has several weapons that could (in theory) be used by a disgruntled
employee or info-terrorist. Items such as high-energy guns that emit data
destroying pulses, and EMF bombs that paralize your systems, are some
the technologies that threaten your system. Yet another reason to lay
awake at night, worrying.
ComputerWorld. Jan. 30, 1995. pg.1

Deadbeat BBS, Beat & Dead
=========================
Novell and Microsoft have reached an agreement that will close the Deadbeat
BBS, located in New Jersey. The teenage-sysop will pay $25,000. in
damages to the software giants, in restitution for the 60+ Novell and
MS products that were allegedly available for downloading on the board.
ComputerWorld. Feb. 6, 1995. pg.8

Big Brother *is* Watching
=========================
Analytic Concept's "GameCop" software is just what the overseer ordered.
The program watches active windows on a PC to see if a game is running.
If one is, a customizable message displays a stern warning for the
employee to get back to work. GameCop can also, optionally, sound an
alarm to embarass the slackard in front of their cellmates..err co-workers.
