FTP Information
+++++++++++++++++++++

We *DO NOT* maintain archives at NIU, and other than back issues of CuD, we
cannot send out archival material. Back issues can be obtained from two ftp
sites:

1. WIDENER: The *CORRECT* Widener ftp address is:
%% ftp cs.widener.edu
or%% ftp 192.55.239.132

On decompressing Zfiles:
The archivist just put up a 16-bit uncompress utility for DOS that'll do the
trick. Get pub/dos/uncom.exe first; then to uncompress anything with the .Z
extension, do it thusly:

	C:\XFER >UNCOM FOO.Z > FOO

(it'll appear on the standard output). He hasn't played with it much yet,
so it may have a -o option or something to it.  The site is available from
6 pm to 6 am.

2. BLAKE: The address and archive list is available to subscribers only.
All files are Zfiles, and if you are using a unix system, use the
"decompress +filename+" command.

+++++++

We have added additional papers and other material to the archives.  We are
ESPECIALLY INTERESTED in receiving papers from lawyers or law students on
CU-related topics. This can include summaries of recent law,
bibliographies, or other material that would be of interest. We have added
the computer crime statutes from Illinois (16D-3) and California (502,
502.7), the ECPA, and other material.  We hope to compile a strong set of
law-related articles and laws, so if you come across any related files,
pass them along.
