Correction of SJG Affidavit
+++++++++++++++++++++

In CuD 2.11, we reprinted the search affidavit used for the Steve Jackson
Games raid.  We included several pages of logs from The Phoenix Project.
These logs *WERE NOT* originally attached to the affidavit, but were sent to
us independently of that document as background.  The judge apparently never
saw the logs. Having read them, one wonders if the investigator did either,
because it defies all sane logic to impute involvement in a criminal "scheme"
merely by explaining that Kermit is a 7-byte transfer protocol used primarily
on mainframes. If you have not read the document, we recommend it.

Len Rose Update
++++++++++++

As of this week, Len Rose had not yet been indicted for the Illinois
charges. Len was arrested in late October on state charges alleging
computer tampering a few days after taking a job in Naperville, Ill. The
original indictment date was postponed by the state. His legal
difficulties, which some of us find the result of overzealous federal
prosecution, continue to hamper his employment possibilities.

Sheldon Zenner, the attorney who successfully defended Craig Neidorf, has
agreed to channel donations to Len for those wishing to support him. *THIS
IS NOT* a legal defense fund, but humanitarian assistance to provide food,
rent, and utilities for wife and family.

       Len Rose Donation
       c/o Sheldon Zenner
       Katten, Muchin and Zavis
       525 W. Monroe, Suite 1600
       Chicago,  IL  60606
