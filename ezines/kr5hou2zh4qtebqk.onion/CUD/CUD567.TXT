Subject: File 1--Having Problems Reading CuD with your Software?

We receive periodic reports that sometimes CuDs are truncated, grossly
mis-formatted, or otherwise glitched when the arrive.  CuDs leave us
as a single file formatted according to standard digest conventions.
Usenet readers often have an option of several software programs, such
as tn, nn, rn, or burst (among others). Sometimes the programs vary in
what they access (for example, nn excludes the preliminary
"administrative trivia" which contains the editorial statement and
ftp/back issue info).  Those receiving CuD from the mailing list may
download it and read with a word processing program that garbles the
format.  On occasion, the way a system receives a program may also
cause a glitch. For example, CIS readers reported truncated CuDs and
wondered if we could fix the problem. It appears, however, that they
were using "WinCIM" to access the service, and that the program has a
bug in it.  American On Line readers using DOS were receiving about a
fifth of each issue because of space limitations on incoming mail (MAC
readers where receiving about 2/3s of an issue).

We appreciate it when readers notify us of problems, because it helps
us keep track of things and sometimes  note to the recipient's
postmaster can fix things. In general, however, we can't do much about
fixing glitches.  If you are having problems reading CuDs, we suggest
that you contact your local system guru and send a copy of your note
to us, along with a brief example of the problem. If the response
isn't adequate, then we'll try to contact the admins to see if we can
help resolve the problem.

For those who've asked, we can't, unfortunately, change the formatting
without causing problems for the vast majority of readers, but we can
try to share tips on resolving some of the problems, about 99 percent
of which can be done simply by switching to an alternative reader.

Subject: File 2--FERPA Redux--more on disses/theses as "private records"

((MODERATORS'S NOTE: In CuD 5.66, we ran the story and our response
to the FERPA ruling by the U.S. Dept of Education, which would
re-classify graduate student theses and dissertations as private
student records and therefore subject to privacy laws. The following
post elaborates on the FERPA interpretation)).

++++

I've extracted this from a recent posting on ala-wo@uicvm.  It gives
more details on the ruling than the original posting. The hangup on
theses and dissertations seems to rest on whether or not you consider
them published. (3rd paragraph, 2nd to last line)

                   DISTRESSING DISSERTATION DEVELOPMENT

A recent AP news release reports that the U.S. Department of Education
has ruled that masters and doctoral theses are considered to be
student "education records," similar to grade records, and are
therefore subject to the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act
(FERPA).  Accordingly, students' theses may not be accessed by
academic researchers without the permission of the student authors.
An opinion issued by LeRoy S. Rooker, Director of the Family Policy
Compliance Office, U.S. Department of Education, stated:

        As you know, FERPA generally protects a student's privacy
        interests with regard to "education records."  "Education
        records" are defined as those records that are 1)
        directly related to a student and 2) maintained by an
        educational agency or institution or a party acting for
        the agency or institution.  34 CFR 99.3.  Accordingly,
        any records which are directly related to a student and
        are maintained by the University are education records
        subject to the provisions of FERPA.  Thus, there are no
        distinctions between undergraduate and graduate theses.

        FERPA prevents subject educational agencies and
        institutions from disclosing education records without
        prior written consent, with specified exceptions 34 CFR
        99.30 and 99.31.  None of the exceptions would permit
        making student theses available to the public, such as in
        the University Library, without first obtaining written
        consent from the student.  Further, the written consent
        must specify the records that may be disclosed; state the
        purpose of the disclosure; and identify the party or
        class of parties to whom the disclosure may be made.  34
        CFR 99.30(b).  This Office recognizes that undergraduate
        honors theses and graduate theses differ in nature from
        typical student research papers and other education
        records in that theses often become research sources
        themselves and are on occasion published.  As such, this
        Office would consider any written statement by a student
        permitting publication of a thesis sufficient consent
        under FERPA because such statement shows that the student
        intended the work to become publicly available.

Rooker told the ALA Washington Office that his office would not take
any action on this issue unless they receive a complaint.

Subject: File 3--Cops plead no contest to selling data

                Cops plead no contest to selling data
           From the San Jose Mercury News August 24, 1993:

     Two former San Jose police officers - arrested last summer for
selling confidential "rap sheets" and driver information to a private
investigator - face three months in Santa Clara County Jail after
pleading no contest to felony conspiracy charges Monday.

     The two men are scheduled to be sentenced Sept. 17 by Santa Clara
County Superior Court Judge Robert Foley.

     Brian D. Blackford, 34, and Robert W. Brownlee, 29 are currently
free on bail.

     Sheila Jean Klopper, 47 - the Mountain View private investigator
to whom they illegally furnished data from the police department's
computer bank - already has pleaded guilty to a reduced charge, been
sentenced to two year's probation and ordered to pay a $300 fine.

     Brownlee, a patrol officer for two years, and Blackford, an
eight-year veteran, were fired after a departmental investigation of
the charges.

     "We hope the prosecution of this case will send a message to
those who might otherwise abuse the computer system," Deputy District
Attorney James Shore said Monday. "Maybe it will make people think
twice. If you had told them (Blackford and Brownlee) that they would
lose their jobs over this, they wouldn't have done it."

     Originally accused of a felony, Klopper pleaded guilty to a
mis-demeanor after a preliminary hearing during which Municipal Judge
Edward J. Nelson - over Shore's objections - granted a motion to lower
the charge.

     Nelson ruled that while Klopper had initially solicited the
officers for confidential information, the offenses by Brownlee and
Blackford were more serious because they had violated positions of
trust for which they should be held to a higher standard. When first
approached by Klopper, they could simply have told her "no," said
Nelson.

     The three were arrested last August after a police probe revealed
the two officers had accessed the department's computer system to
provide Klopper Investigations of Mountain View with information in
connection with criminal and civil cases. Klopper, who paid $25 a copy
for the documents, worked for several of San Jose's prominent lawyers.

     It could never be determined exactly how many records Klopper
purchased, but the total exceeded 50 and may have numbered several
hundred over a year or more, Shore said.

     Under state law, police officers are permitted access to criminal
background information only for official investigations.

     In the San Jose Police Department, an officer can retrieve a
background report from the Criminal Justice Information System by
logging onto a computer. Badge numbers are used to identify the
individual seeking the information.

     Brownlee and Blackford circumvented the procedures meant to
identify officers by signing onto the system with either non-existent
badge numbers or with the badge numbers of other officers, according
to Shore. On one occasion, the number 1000 - used by retired Chief
Joseph McNamara, was used to bypass security.

     Daniel Jansen, the attorney for Blackford and Brownlee, said
theirs was "one of the saddest cases" he has handled in the years he
has been defending cops.

     "Two fine officers threw over their careers for so little. It
cost them so much," he said.

     Both men went through divorces after their arrests.

Subject: File 4--Article on Patient Privacy

Here is an article that was printed in the 27 AUG 93 Denver Post:

                    Patients' legal past for sale
                  By Tamar Lewin, The New York Times

  Philadelphia doctors will soon be offered a new service that may
have been inevitable in a society in which both lawsuits and computers
are commonplace: For $80 a month, they can find out whether a
prospective patient has ever filed a malpractice suit against another
doctor.

  The service, Courtscan, is to begin direct-mail marketing to
Philadelphia-area doctors next week, said William Benedict, president
of Courtscan Services in Greenwich, Conn.

  Benedict said the service would be expanded to New York, Chicago,
Houston, Los Angeles and Miami within six months.  He also said that
he planned to offer a similar service to employers, landlords,
insurers and others who may be leery of litigation.

  Courtscan will offer doctors "complete litigation histories of
patients in 60 seconds or less," Benedict said.  The company's
advertisements counsel doctors to "screen new patients you think
might be `malpractice-prone,' so you can adopt necessary defensive
cautionary measures."

  Litigation records have always been public, but until the advent of
computers it was extremely cumbersome to search court records for a
particular person's legal complaints.  But now, Benedict said, his
company has a data base of all 802,000 lawsuit and judgments filed
with Philadelphia's Court of Common Pleas since 1982.

  While there is nothing illegal in compiling or selling such data,
some doctors and consumer advocates worry that such a service might do
more harm than good, smearing individuals who had filed claims in good
faith and creating an increasingly hostile relationship between
doctors and patients.

  Indeed, the Pennsylvania Medical Society recently refused to run an
advertisement for Courtscan in its monthly magazine.  "We are
concerned about anything that would possibly prejudice a physician
against caring for a particular patient," said Dr. Donald Ferguson,
the president of the society.

Subject: File 5--CuNews - Whitehouse Mail; SPA's "Cities of Pirates"

Anti-Smoking Video Game
=======================
In an effort to use video games as social/health propaganda, the
American Cancer Society will be placing "Tabaccoid" video games in
shopping malls.  While the game doesn't have any blatant messages,
player must kill the evil Tobacco monster (dubbed "Tabaccoid") to
advance in the game. The free-play arcade game will be appearing in
shopping malls soon.  (WLS Radio, Chicago IL 8/23/93)

Executive Branch Email
======================
The White House has until September to appeal a US appellate court
ruling that email must be preserved, as are paper documents, for
storage in the National Archives.  The ruling applies primarily to a
1300-user network that links the White House, the Cabinet, and the
National Security Council.  White House information services officials
are reportedly displeased, but one anonymously stated that the White
House Communications Agency "must and will adhere to the law".
(Information Week. August 23, 1993. pg 15)

City of Pirates
===============
The SPA (Software Publishers Association) says that 34 of the piracy cases
it closed in fiscal '93 were in Los Angeles.  SPA characterizes the city
as a "piracy hotspot". New York City (28 cases) and San Francisco (18)
were close behind. On a per-state basis, California, Texas, Florida, New
York, and Illinois are the top five for anti-piracy action over the last
three years. These five states combined account for 62% of SPA cases. Since
1990 the SPA has initiated more than 1300 actions across the nation.
(Information Week. August 23, 1993. pg 16)
ComputerWorld (August 23, 1993 pg 16) adds that Houston is the city with
the fourth largest incidence of piracy cases.

All Time Wiretap Record
=======================
The Privacy Journal reports the Bush adminstration's average of 332
wiretap applications per year - mainly for drug offenses - was nearly
twice the yearly amount of the Reagan administration. In comparison:
from the time of the Watergate years in the early-1970's to 1983,
federal wiretap authorization did not exceed 140 in one year.

Subject: File 7--"Dirty Dan" Teaches "anti-hacking" to 3rd Graders

   "Ethics Program for Children Introduces 'Dirty Dan' the Hacker"

                   staff and news service reports)

Goosebery makes computer mistakes because she hasn't been properly
trained. Chip worries that Gooseberry's blunders will spill secrets.
And then there's Dirty Dan, the hapless hacker whose dastardly doings
know no bounds.

Welcome to the latest in computer crime prevention -- an ethics and
security program designed to teach children from kindergarten through
third grade to take a "byte" out of crime.

"The average hackers's getting younger and younger," program
developer Lonnie Moore said."Right now, there's a computer in every
classroom. What we found was that nobody out there is teaching ethics
and security."

Moore is a computer security manager at the Lawrence Livermore National
Laboratory's Computation Organization. Workers there, including
puppeteer Gale Warshawsky, have developed a 30-minute presentation for
young computer users.

The star of the show is Chip, a puppet representing the computer
itself. Gooseberry is the poorly trained computer operator, Dirty Dan
the heinous hacker -- and sloppy eater -- and Goldie Sock the
commentator.

Philip Chapnick, director of the Computer Security Institute in San
Francisco, praised the idea of teaching children to be good computer
citizens.

"One of the major issues in information security in companies now is
awareness. Starting the kids off early. ...I think it will pay off,"
Chapnick said.
