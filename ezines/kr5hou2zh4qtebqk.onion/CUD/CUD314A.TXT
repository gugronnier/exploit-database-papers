Mail and Corrupted Issues
++++++++++++++++++++

We received a number of notes asking about the resend of CuD 3.13.
Our system is an IBM clone, and the mailer is patched in. When we have
mail problems, we are not able to determine the status of any mail we
send out because of the limited capabilities of the patch.  On
occasion, especially during net-jams, this leads to some readers
receiving duplicate files. If a number of files are corrupted, as
sometimes happens when the nets are jammed or a gateway is not
operating properly, it is sometimes necessary to resend a file or, in
the case 3.13, the entire list. Optimal size is about 40K, and the
last issue ran well over that. To facilitate mailing, we deleted the
single file that brought us to the 40 K file size and re-sent.  If
people are experiencing problems receiving CuD, drop us a note.

We have also received on 23 April a horde of email posts dated between
30 March-2 April. The bulk of it seemed to originate from the west and
southwest. We generally reply to posts on the same day they are
received, so if you do not receive a reply, let us know.

Information on subversive software wanted
++++++++++++++++

Gordon is in the beginning stages of research for a technical paper on
'subversive' software.   The article will discuss software that has
been written for unusual purposes and circumstances, not all of which
may be legal.  Examples in this "genre" would be 'Fuckin' Hacker',
'Code Thief', and 'Receipt Writer'.

It would be helpful to gather as many examples as possible, from many
different computer platforms. He is *not* seeking executable copies,
but just the name and description of the program.  Any additional
historical information, such as author name, date, innovative
features, etc would be a bonus.  If you can recall having seen, used,
or heard of any unusual software that you feel fits in this category
He would appreciate it if you'd drop me a line.  The article has not,
as of yet, been slated for publication, but he will supply a finished
copy to anyone who responds or requests one.  The finished work may
also appear in a future issue of CuD.

Thanks for your time and assistance!  Gordon Meyer

PhD Seeks info on Computer Security
+++++++++++++++++++++

Paul Taylor, a PhD candidate in England, sent the following note
along. He is doing some interesting research, and is trying to
obtain additional data.

+++++++

From: P.A.Taylor@EDINBURGH.AC.UK
Subject: PhD Seeks Info on Computer Security
Date: 18 Apr 91 14:17:16 bst

I'm into the second year of a PhD looking at the rise of the computer
security industry and the concomitant rise of cracking/browsing and
viruses, here at the University of Edinburgh.

Part of my research involves e-mail interviews and questionnaires.  If
you would be willing to take part in it, then please get in touch.
I'll send you a yes/no type questionnaire and after that if you are
willing, a set of questions designed more to start a dialogue about
some of the issues surrounding computer security, which could form the
basis of an on-going e-mail interview to be acknowledged or kept
anonymous in my final thesis, depending on the wishes of the
respondent.

ALL MY WORK IS FOR PURELY ACADEMIC PURPOSES AND TOTAL CONFIDENTIALITY
IS GUARANTEED.

IF IN DOUBT AS TO MY ACADEMIC STATUS PLEASE CONTACT ME AND INDEPENDENT
VERIFICATION CAN BE SUPPLIED.

Thank you in advance,

Paul A. Taylor,
Depts of Economics and Politics,
Edinburgh University.
