Information on subversive software wanted
++++++++++++++++

(Gordon received a number of helpul replies from his earlier request,
but for those who missed CuD 3.14, we reprint it again.  Thanks to all
those who responded).

Gordon is in the beginning stages of research for a technical paper on
'subversive' software.   The article will discuss software that has
been written for unusual purposes and circumstances, not all of which
may be legal.  Examples in this "genre" would be 'Fuckin' Hacker',
'Code Thief', and 'Receipt Writer'.

It would be helpful to gather as many examples as possible, from many
different computer platforms. He is *not* seeking executable copies,
but just the name and description of the program.  Any additional
historical information, such as author name, date, innovative
features, etc would be a bonus.  If you can recall having seen, used,
or heard of any unusual software that you feel fits in this category
He would appreciate it if you'd drop me a line.  The article has not,
as of yet, been slated for publication, but he will supply a finished
copy to anyone who responds or requests one.  The finished work may
also appear in a future issue of CuD.

Thanks for your time and assistance!  Gordon Meyer

New BBS
+++++++

A new BBS, similar in goals and philosophy to FACE-TO-FACE (which
crashed) began May 18. It's called FREE SPEECH (618-943-2399), and
will be open to all callers.  Computer security and law enforcement
agents are welcome.  The sysop (Crimson Death) aims to encourage
discussion and debate of Constitutional, computer security, and other
issues.  It's running Emulex, HST compatible, and users are encouraged
to upload news articles and related files.
