Subject: File 1--Chsun1 mailserv/ftp NO LONGER AVAILABLE

Bob Kusumoto, archivist at the U of Chicago site, informs us that they
can no longer make back issues of files available. This generally
affects bitnet users without ftp access. At this point, because of
availability of back issues of CuD from other sources, we do not plan
to find a new site. We will re-assess the need in a few months, but
our sense is that between ftp and alternative sites, most readers will
not be inconvenienced.

Bob has been an archivist nearly from CuD's beginning, and provided a
shadow site to Brendan's. We (and others) appreciate and thank him for
his initiative and hard work and will miss him.

          COMPUTER, FREEDOM, PRIVACY CONFERENCE-II  on RADIO

Public radio listeners across the nation will have "virtual front row
seats" at the Second Annual Conference on Computers, Freedom, and
Privacy.  The sessions were recorded at the March conference by Bruce
Koball and digitally edited for broadcast by Gregg McVicar (The
Privacy Project).

Ten one-hour programs will be available to stations through the public
radio satellite system, beginning June 23rd.

#1  Bruce Sterling "Speaking for the Unspeakable"
#2  Ethics, Morality, and Criminality
#3  Logging on to the Networks of the Future
#4  Free Speech and the Public Telephone Network
#5  Who's in Your Genes? Genetic Data Banking & Privacy
#6  Private Collection of Personal Information
#7  Privacy and Intellectual Freedom in the Digital Library
#8  Computers in the Workplace:  Elysium or Panopticon?
#9  Who Holds the Keys?  Cryptography, Privacy, and Security.
#10  Public Policy for the 21st Century.

Each station decides independently whether or not to air a program
offering and where to place it in its broadcast schedule. Therefore,
interested listeners are advised to immediately contact the program
director at their public radio station in support of carrying the
COMPUTERS, FREEDOM, & PRIVACY series locally.

KALW in San Francisco, Oregon Public Broadcasting, KPBS in San Diego,
WYEP in Pittsburgh, and WUMB in Boston plan to air the programs this
summer and have graciously provided seed funding for the project.

For more information, contact Gregg McVicar at Pacific Multimedia

Subject: File 3--Another side of privacy

It is difficult to strike a balance between the just desires of
individuals for personal privacy, and the just needs of a community to
have an informed accounting of the consequences of the actions of its
individual members.

The problem with privacy is that there are those who intentionally use
it to cover their wrong-doing.  Further, it shields those who are
casually irresponsible from being held accountable.

The following exemplifies the adverse side of privacy.  It is not from
an Evil Corporation, nor a Naive Computer Neophyte, nor from a Person
Who Disrespects Privacy.  Instead, it's from a mostly-consultant who
is an experienced computer pro, and someone who has long-illustrated
deep concern for ethical and civil-liberties issues.

Aside:  This is similar to women who receive obscene or threatening
phone calls, but [a] can't get the local cops (or courts) to monitor
the line, and [b] are prohibited from having Caller ID to aid their
personal defense against anonymous electronic intruders in their
homes.  Police won't furnish protection (or don't have the resources),
and the law suppresses the tools for self-defense against unwanted
intrusion.
  Result: Phone-owners' privacy in their own homes is degraded or
forfeited in order to protect the privacy of anonymous, covert
callers.

I have a problem with certain privacy concerns (this time I am on the
anti-privacy side).  I have court judgements against some southern CA
slime bags (you want a definition, their BUSINESSES will not identify
themselves when you call them, they answer "corporate" and if you ask
who you have reached repeatedly, they will hang up on you).  I think I
have a RIGHT to know where they live and work so I can serve them with
legal papers.  Remember, they have already LOST the suit, their day in
court is over.  But without going to court AGAIN for a separate order,
I cannot pull their credit records (privacy).  BS!  This is just a
makework thing for attorneys and PIs.  You see, I can get the credit
report illegally for $30 (instead of $8 if I had a right to it).  What
a crock!   Do you agree?

Worse yet, all this privacy BS has given us 3 separate ID numbers.  The
DMV wants driver's license number and birthdate, the credit guys want
SSN.  I am all for a law-abiding guy trying to keep his private affairs
private, but when you have lost in court, those same laws keep you from
having to pay up.  BS I say.  Do you agree?

I am not sure I have an implementation, but I sure would work on one if
there were any reason to believe it would do some good.   Dave

             PLAYBOY'S NEW PLAYMATE - EVENT HORIZONS BBS
                            by Lance Rose

  One of the most common personal uses of modems today is to transfer
graphic image files between computers.  Sources for images are cheap
and plentiful - just pick up any picture book or magazine.  Often the
hard part is finding someone with a scanner to turn the picture into
an uploadable computer file, but there are more and more of those as
well.  Many of the most profitable small BBS', not to mention
CompuServe and other large information services, make a great deal of
money from the high volume of image uploads and downloads performed
daily across the country.

A large part of that volume is taken up by pictures of nude women and
sexually oriented materials.  It's hard to pinpoint the ultimate
social meaning of this activity, but it's a fact that lots of people
are spending lots of time and money sending computerized soft and hard
pornography through the telephone lines.  The cost is often far
greater than the price of a newsstand magazine that contains the same
picture at far greater resolution.  Yet people keep doing it, and some
BBS' profit greatly from it.

Behind the scenes, fueling the boom, are the source images used to
create the digitized files.  All too often these sources, whether they
depict a beautiful forest, a way cool car or a buxom blonde, are
copyrighted illustrations from magazines and books.  This is a
well-known fact of life to most BBS users.  When the practice of
scanning copyrighted images is debated online, the issue is usually
not whether it's legal (except among the "information wants to be
free" types), but who will get nailed by a copyright owner, and when.

It happened in March.  Playboy Enterprises sued Event Horizons BBS for
infringement.  Event Horizons is one of the largest BBS' in the
country, and well-known as a major center for uploading and
downloading graphic images, including pictures of nude women and
sexual images.  Users are charged for downloading by connect time, so
the larger the file and longer it takes to download, the more a user
pays for the file.  The BBS is said to gross over two million dollars
per year, and has served (in the profit-making sense at least) as an
ideal and model for others who run their BBS' as a business.  Event
Horizons makes files available not only online, but also in
collections on disks.

This is an important case for BBS sysops, especially if the parties
fail to settle and it goes to trial.  The resulting decision could set
some standards for copyright infringement by BBS', and help sysops
better determine which files to keep on their boards and which are
safest only when dropped in the bit bucket.

Playboy's suit actually claims two kinds of infringement:  copyright
and trademark.  On the copyright side, nine pictures of scantily clad
or naked women from the pages of Playboy Magazine (sandwiched, as
always, in between the Serious Articles) were discovered in Event
Horizon's file collection.  The ladies pictured in the files include
such well-known babes as Linda Evans, Vanna White and Jessica Hahn.

Playboy pulls no rabbit punches in illustrating its claim that the
Event Horizons files are indeed direct copies.  Playboy's legal
complaint includes all of the identified pictures from the magazine
and the corresponding printouts of Event Horizon's image files
(Apparently, those exhibits are meant only for the judge.  Playboy's
corporate communications department made only the written portion of
the complaint available upon my request.  Is this corporate image
management, or just their way of telling me I have to pay for those
pictures like everyone else?).  In addition to these pictures, Playboy
identifies other files described in Event Horizon's disk catalog as
probable infringements, even though Playboy has not seen them, based
on descriptions of the files such as "pretty nude Playboy photo" and
"Playmate; topless young body."  If the descriptions are accurate,
that's pretty damning evidence that someone infringed Playboy's
copyrights, though of course the actual pictures would have to be
produced.

The trademark claim by Playboy has two contradictory components.  On
one hand, Playboy claims that Event Horizon's use of the name
"Playboy" with the files will confuse the public into wrongly thinking
that Playboy somehow sponsors or authorizes Event Horizon's
maintenance of the files.  On the other hand, Playboy also says that
Event Horizon's use of "EH" will confuse the public into wrongly
thinking that Event Horizons, and not Playboy, is the real producer of
the pictures contained in the files.  Playboy is right that these
names create confusion.  At this stage, however, Playboy seems to be
the one who is a bit confused by it all.

Playboy still has a lot of points in its favor, though.  For instance,
Playboy claims that Event Horizons' own copyright notice was found on
some of the files in question.  That one might be pretty hard for
Event Horizons to explain away.  Playboy also states that it sent six
warning letters to Event Horizons complaining about infringement, and
that Event Horizons did not stop the activities complained of.  Again,
if this is true, it makes it look like Playboy gave Event Horizons
every opportunity to stop the claimed infringing practices, and only
brought legal action when the practices continued despite the endless
stream of letters.

As compensation for it's grief, Playboy is looking for a big payoff.
First, it wants a permanent injunction against any further
distribution of the files by Event Horizons.  Second, it wants to
receive all of Event Horizons' profits from the files, measured by the
connect time charges paid by users downloading those files.  This
could be a very big amount if the judge accepts that measure of
damages.  Third, it wants Event Horizons to pay all of Playboy's legal
costs in bringing the legal action - another big number, which Event
Horizons will have to pay if Playboy wins.  Fourth, it wants the court
to impound all files and disks containing the infringing files, and
the equipment used to make those files and disks - this could even
mean the BBS itself.  There are even more damage claims, but there's
only so much room in this column.

Looks like a pretty grim situation for Event Horizons . . .

However, the game is not over.  Jim Maxey, Event Horizons' owner,
tells a somewhat different story.  He says that all of the files in
question were not created by him, but by BBS users who uploaded them
for credits permitting them to download other files for free.   His
policy has been to ban all Playboy images he could identify, but he
says that some slip through nonetheless.  If the file description does
not say the file is scanned from Playboy or another copyrighted
source, he has little way of knowing where it came from.

Maxey confirms that Playboy first contacted him about a year ago.  He
says that when he first heard from Playboy, he redoubled his efforts
to remove any Playboy-related files from his BBS, and sent Playboy
letters certifying his removal efforts.  However, Playboy never
acknowledged receiving his letters; there was "no way to communicate
with them."  The next thing he knew, Playboy was suing him in federal
court.

Maxey also claims that Playboy is trying to physically intimidate him.
In particular, he says Playboy hired an enormous man, 250-300 pounds,
to serve him with the complaint.  When the process server came to
Event Horizons' office, he allegedly smashed the receptionist against
the door, seriously injuring her hip and causing her to miss four
weeks of work.  He says the man is currently being held by the police.

Event Horizons is changing its look and feel now, according to Maxey.
"Adult images" form only a small part of the current file transfer
activity on his BBS, as its focus shifts to education and
entertainment.  His current projects include creating collections of
animations, and distributing the larger ones on CD-ROMs, including
animations with astronomical themes such as a tour of the planets of
the solar system.

Gee, after hearing Jim's side of the story, it makes you wonder why
Playboy is so upset.  Someone here is telling less than the whole
truth.  These stories are too contradictory to both be real.  I
suspect both sides have polished up their stories just a bit for prime
time.

Playboy, for instance, is not beyond trying to pull the wool over the
judge's eyes.  At one point, Playboy claims that "access by Event
Horizons to the [Playboy] copyrighted photographs should be presumed
in view of the striking similarity between the images contained in the
above identified Event Horizons' files and the corresponding [Playboy]
copyrighted photographs."  In other words, Playboy would have us
believe that if you find an image scanned from a magazine on a BBS, we
can presume the sysop did the scanning himself.

This is obviously not so to anyone who knows about BBS', and the
statement reveals either ignorance or attempted deception on Playboy's
part.  Most image files on BBS' are uploaded by users.  It may well be
that Playboy's claim that Maxey created the files is true, but that is
something that must be proved, not presumed.  Most BBS sysops today
are not creators of most of the materials on their systems, but
distributors.  This is a very important distinction in a case like
this, because it means that the primary wrongdoer is the user who
uploaded the file, not the sysop who merely made it available for
download by others.

Certain parts of Maxey's story are also questionable.  Though he
claims that all Playboy images found on his BBS were uploaded by
users, there are others who say it is common knowledge that Maxey
himself stocks his BBS with his own scans from Playboy and other
magazines.  We will have to wait for the evidence to come in on this
one.

It is also pretty hard to go along with Maxey's reasoning on Playboy's
failure to acknowledge his letters to them.  If Playboy did not
respond to his letter, why didn't he pick up the phone and call them?
Their number's in the phone book.

Of course, the parties may settle this case before it reaches trial.
In that event, the main effect of the case would be a warning to other
sysops not to become involved in infringing image files, at least when
the images are Playboy's.

What if the case does go to trial?  Maxey's shifting of the blame for
infringement to his users raises the possibility he will use the same
defense successfully used by CompuServe recently in obtaining
dismissal from a libel suit against it.  As readers of this magazine
may recall, in the case of CompuServe v.  Cubby, CompuServe was sued
as the distributor of an electronic newsletter that supposedly
contained defamatory comments about a competing newsletter.  The judge
let CompuServe out of the case on the basis that CompuServe did not
create the newsletter, but only distributed it.  In a landmark ruling
for BBS', the judge held that BBS' are protected by the 1st Amendment
as distributors of free speech.  It is impermissible to make a sysop
absolutely responsible for reviewing everything that passes through
the system.

For Maxey to successfully use this argument to escape the infringement
claim, he will need to prove that all of the infringing files were
uploaded by users, and that he was not actually aware of any of them
before Playboy brought them to his attention.  This could be a tough
task, especially for the files that supposedly have Event Horizons'
own copyright notice attached to them.  It could be fun to watch him
try, though.

Playboy's motives in bringing the suit can certainly be questioned.
My guess is that Playboy is getting ready to begin its own online
distribution of girlie pictures, and wants to clear out the
established competition.  Playboy pictures probably form only a small
part of all the files on Event Horizons' BBS, but this lawsuit can
have a disproportionately large effect on the BBS' overall finances.
Playboy is letting the online world know that a Big Boy is entering
the scene, so watch out.  At this point, Playboy will only be the
second major company of its sort in the online world.  Penthouse
already has its own BBS, and has announced in the business news pages
that it sees its future in electronic communications.

However it ends up, this suit should serve as a word to the wise for
sysops and users of BBS'.  The days of the free ride in scanning
printed copyrighted materials are coming to an end.  The future of
image files in BBS'ing will not (and indeed should not) be merely to
reproduce mass-distributed print photographs and illustrations, but to
serve as a new and different distribution medium.  Graphic artists of
all kinds who do not have access to print distribution channels should
receive increasing distribution on BBS'.  New image types, best
displayed on computer screens (especially animations) rather than
paper, will continue to develop and flourish.  By helping bring an end
to online infringement of its printed girlie pictures for gentlemen,
Playboy is, likely unwittingly, helping to usher in a new and far more
interesting online computer graphics regime.

Subject: File 7--PC BBS Raided by FBI (reprint)

                 "PC Bulletin Board Hit by FBI Raid"
                     By Josh Hyatt (Boston Globe)
           From:   (Chicago Tribune, June 14. Sect 7, p 3)

BOSTON--In one of the first reported crackdowns of its kind, six FBI
agents raided a computer bulletin board based in a Millbury, Mass.,
home last week. Authorities said the bulletin board's operator had
been illegally distributing copyrighted software.

Executing a criminal search warrant, the agents seized several
computers, six modems and a program called PC Board, which was used to
run the bulletin board. Authorities also seized documents that listed
users of the service.

No arrests were made, according to the Software Publisher's
Association, a trade group that brought the case to the FBI's
attention. The association estimates that, as of March, the bulletin
board had distributed $675,000 worth of copyrighted software; software
pirates, it says, annually steal as much as $12 billion this way.

The FBI will not comment on the case except to confirm that a raid had
taken place and that the investigation is continuing. The alleged
operator of the bulletin board, Richard Kenadek, could not be reached
for comment.

Around the same time as the raid, the software association filed a
civil lawsuit against Kenadek, charging him with violating copyright
laws. Ilene Rosenthal, the group's director of litigation, said that
"the man had incriminated himself" through various computerized
messages.

"There's plenty of evidence to show that he was very aware of
everything on his bulletin board," she said.

Bulletin boards let personal computer users access a host computer via
modems. Typically, participants exchange information regarding
everything from computer programs to tropical fish.  They may also,
for example, obtain upgrades of computer programs.

The association said its own four-month investigation revealed that
this bulletin board, called Davy Jones Locker, contained copies of
more than 200 copyrighted programs.

Rosenthal said users also were encouraged to contribute copyrighted
software programs for others to download or copy.

According to Rosenthal, subscribers paid a fee, $49 for three months
or $99 for one year. She said Davy Jones Locker had nearly 400 paying
subscribers in 36 states and 11 foreign countries.
