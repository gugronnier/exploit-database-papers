Your reference to the FBI tactics in the arrest of Earth First participants
as questionable, illegal, immoral, unethical, and generally wrong, led me
to look up the original article. It appeared in THE CHICAGO TRIBUNE (and
presumably other sources) on March 2, 1990, pp. 1, 12, titled "FBI tactics
questioned in probe of activeists," by Terry Atlas, date-lined Phoenix.  The
article describes what appears to be entrapment, and suggests that the FBI
set up the leaders intentionally:

     "PHOENIX--Mike Tait was a quiet, troubled cowboy, a Vietnam War
     veteran in his early 40s who wore an Arizona Feeds cap that
     covered his bald spot.

     As it turned out, he was hiding a lot more than that.

     To his best friend, Margaret "Peg" Millett, a part-time counselor
     at a Planned Parenthood clinic in Prescott, Ariz., tait was a
     good-hearted redneck who liked to dance and was trying to get in
     touch with his feelings.

     Along with Millett and some of her friends, he took an interest
     in "monkey-wrenching"--disruptive, often illegal, acts in the
     name of Mother Nature--popularized by the radical environmental
     group Earth First!.

     One night last May, Tait drove Millett and two of her trusted
     friends into the Arizona desert outside Prescott on such a
     clandestine mission.

     Suddenly, flares exploded that lit up the desert sky and exposed
     Tait's secret. More than 40 FBI agencies--on foot, on horseback
     and in a helicopter--moved in on tait's unarmed friends as they
     allegedly used a blowtorch in an attempt to cut down a power-line
     tower.

     The ambush, and the arrest the next morning of Earth First!
     founder David Foreman 200 miles away in Tucson, climaxed an
     18-month federal undercover investigation into what the
     government charges was a dangerous group of eco-terrorists whose
     nighttime raid was a practice run for more serious attacks on
     power lines at nuclear plants in Arizona, California and
     Colorado.

     The investigation was begun with high-level approval from
     Washington during the Reagan administration. It included putting
     FBI agent Michael Fain undercover as Mike Tait, backed up by
     wiretaps, hidden microphones and body wires used to secretly
     record more than 1,400 %page break, con't on page 12% hours of
     conversations among environmental activeists."

The article goes on to question whether such resources were
simply retaliation for Foreman's outspoken advocacy of an
anti-nuclear position. The issue raised in the article is that
the FBI was out to get Fain. The article continues (p. 12):

     "And new evidence--an apparently careless remark by agent Fain
     that was inadvertently recorded--lends some support to Foreman's
     charge that he was the big catch the government wanted.

     On one tape that the government recently provided to defense
     attorneys, what is apparently Fain's voice is heard telling two
     other FBI agents that Foreman wasn't an actual perpetrator. This
     is the guy we need to pop to send a message."

     "That's all we're really doing," he goes on, "and if we don't
     nail this guy and we get only Davis, we're not sending any
     message."

     They laughed that the supposedly fearsome band of environmental
     radicals was holding a yard sale in Tucson to raise enough money
     to keep going, and Fain remarks, "They're low budget, and I don't
     really look for them to be doing a lot of hurting of people."

     Then suddenly realizing that the tape recorder is on, Fain says,
     "We don't need that on the tape. Hoo boy," and he shuts it of.

Gerry Spence is defending Earth First!, and, according to the
article, the trial has been postponed from the original April
date.

I find the implications of this scary. I don't support bombings
and destruction of property, but I like a police state even less.
I don't know what counts as a set in law, but common sense tells me
that something's not right here. It seems like the FBI is
manipulating people and events to assure a particular kind of
outcome. What did this entire operation cost? How much will
tax payers have to pay for the prosecution of what could result in
a fiasco? Who else are the feds manipulating and for what purpose?
Who does the approving? Where does legitimate law enforcement
strategy end and gestapo tactics begin? I don't have any answers.
Does anybody else?
