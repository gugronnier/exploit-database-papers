Subject: File 1--Bruce Sterling on ABC/Australia's Attitude (excerpts)

This transcript from Attitude, ABC/Australia September 8 includes the
parts by Bruce Sterling and an Australian federal police officer.

Bruce Sterling (I think you all know who he is)

"Law enforcement officers tell me that if they break into a teenagers
home and he's got a computer and a modem and a copy of William
Gibsons, Neuromancer, they just know he's trouble.

 It uses a new set of topics to think about, I mean, rather than
thinking about rocket ships and robots and so forth, the things of the
'50s and '60s, it thinks about matters like electronic networking and
the impact of high technology media and genetic engineering and that
sort of thing.

 I'm enough of a anarcho-individualist in a funny kind of way to think
that I probably ought to be able to make up my own mind about what I
think is interesting and I really shouldn't have the government spoon
feeding me the kind of information they think is healthy for me to
know.  There are legitimate security interests, but that's not the
same thing as living under general censorship.  You know, my feeling
is... it's my business to find stuff out and think about things, it's
my business to imagine things, it's not my business to control what
other people think.  And I resent it when people try to stop me from
finding things out that I feel I need to know, for whatever reason.

 People are afraid of hackers because they are frightened of
computers.  I mean that's the real basis of the sort of gut-level
superstitious fear.  They're afraid of computers and they're afraid of
the power of computers, that's kind of a legitimate fear, I mean,
power without responsibility is a terrible thing, and, you know, there
are reasons to be upset by people that are computer literate or very
skilled with computers, if they have no sense of social
responsibility, these people can in fact do quite a bit of harm, you
know, subtle ways that are hard to detect and prosecute." [..]
Detective Seargent Ken Day of the Australian Federal Police.:

"We have the capacity if we have sufficient evidence, for example and
we consider it a serious crime to arrest.  We have, for example, the
capacity to obtain a warrant to search someone's house.  But we don't
decide we can go out and do that, we must answer all our actions
before a judicial body such as a court.

  It is not a game, it's a criminal act.  The legislation is not
enacted, not on whim, legislation isn't acted in this country after
extensive and serious consultation and computer crimes were
identified as being criminal activity.  They are anti-social.  They
are morally, and they are now illegally, wrong.  It is not a game.

  The infrastructure that we work in now that we live in is by and
large controlled or monitored by computer technology and examples are
traffic lights, telephone systems, bank. all these that we relly upon
are controlled by computer networks.  Remove those networks from the
loop, you don't have those services.  That's why we must protect it.

  Some people might say, well, federal police don't know about me, I'm
hacking away, they just don't know, they haven't busted my door down.
Well the simple answer to that question is maybe we know about you but
we're investigating more serious crimes."

There are more comments made by the ex Australian army security man
and talks to hackers <sigh/grin>.

In CuD #5.75 File 3 ("Raising the Issue of Copyright on the Nets")
gray@ANTAIRE.COM (Gray Watson), objecting to the inclusion of a
copyrighted article, writes

>I don't think CUD should have allowed this.  I send out a standard
>message when I see such posts and it is applicable here:
>
>    >For your information, including a significant amount of text

>    >laws.

I have been tracking the `cyberspatial copyright issue' with a great
deal of interest for some time, and Mr. Watson's complaint is pretty
standard fare in the debate. Since it appears in a journal and my
response might be posted, I'm taking the time to write this.

I think Mr. Watson and everyone else who claims that digital
publications will not arrive until the Net respects copyright law in
its present form are fundamentally mistaken. First of all, what the
heck *does* copyright law say about cyberspace? absolutely nothing
specifically. There are many *interpretations* of copyright law that
attempt to promote one view or another based on the current
classifications of various forms and distributions, but they are all
mostly nebulous. Is an FTP site a library or what? What constitutes
`redistribution'?

It seems to me that the fundamental issues behind a copyright are one
or more of the following: the author desires to (1) control the
distribution of a work exclusively, (2) make money therefrom, (3)
guarantee the writing is not `corrupted', i.e. it does not credit
someone else and is not mixed with other people's material. In
particular, if (1) can be guaranteed than (2) and (3) can be derived
therefrom.

Now, suppose that future cyberspatial authors give up or sacrifice (1)
if (2) and (3) are more closely adhered to. I believe most authors
would prefer this system. I imagine the following scenario. An author
creates the text for unlimited distribution, with an email address that
indicates where `digital cash' can be sent to compensate him, including
a suggested donation or whatever.

Under this scheme, the author gives up `exclusive distribution' to
maximize actual dissemination and thereby exposure and potential
personal profit. Under this system, the reader of the articles are
required to (1) send digital cash when they have benefited from the
article, where appropriate, and (2) not alter the text of an article
when they redistribute it. Note that under this scheme we don't need
the silly taboo that people are to be criticized for redistribution of
articles -- to the contrary, they should be recognized for their
selfless public service, whereby they are causing benefit to the author
of the article by their efforts, with no personal profit therefrom.

I imagine other interesting distributions systems that will arise with
the advent of digital cash. For example, the email addresses of all
intermediate distributors may be appended to the beginning of an
article in reverse order. The original author would be free to specify
the system: send me money and the distribution list that was the header
of the article *you* received, and I will redistribute the money among
the redistributors. We should always recognize that the ultimate author
has the ultimate right to the digital cash, however, because otherwise
the writing would not have existed.

This is what might be called a `shareware copyright' for text, and I
think it is an extremely workable system, and I believe it will evolve
to become the norm. Certainly, some people will object to the system,
but I suspect they are mostly `middlemen' in the current system that
generally derive an undue profit from mere redistribution.

However, there are systems where complete control of redistribution is
desirable. For example, an author might wish to track directly every
place in cyberspace his article has been received. Under this scenario,
we can imagine a sort of `toll gopher' system, wherein the traversal of
a hypertext link in a text system causes an automatic toll to be
applied between receiver and provider. Again, digital cash forms a
fundamental basis for this system. In this system, the `copyright'
implies that anyone that passes on an article passes on the *address*
of the hypertext location, so that the next person does not retrieve a
`dissociated' article but instead accesses the `official' version.
Again, people must agree not to alter digital cash addresses associated
with articles. And in fact a taboo similar to that associated with
redistribution in the current system will arise against `piracy' or
`tampering' of the digital cash addresses.

Finally, I must note that under all these scenarios a vast, ubiquitous,
and instantaneous cyberspatial infrastructure is intrinsic to the
overall system. However, at the current pace, this should not be an
overwhelming difficulty. It is the ultimate goal of everyone currently
inhabiting Cyberspace anyway.

Under the above schemes, I imagine that future cyberspace will become
extremely hospitable to all future writers and editors, who are freed
to focus on the absolute essentials of their craft, unchained from
burdensome and irrelevant constraints associated with costly,
complicated, and imperfect distribution systems. In fact, we will find
that in future cyberspace *everyone* will be seen as acting as writers
and editors. It will become a fundamental aspect of cyberspatial
living, recognized as natural and fundamental as word processing is
today.

                        CALL FOR CONTRIBUTORS:
              VOLUME ON COMPUTER-MEDIATED COMMUNICATION

As an outgrowth of a panel presented at the 4th International
Pragmatics Conference in Kobe, Japan on "Cultural and Linguistic
Aspects of Computer-Mediated Communication", a volume is being
prepared for publication in the _Pragmatics goal of the volume is to
bring together the best in current research on CMC as a social,
cultural and linguistic phenomenon.  Contributions should be
empirically-oriented (that is, based on observation of actual CMC) and
focused primarily on language and communication (rather than on
technological aspects or secondary applications of the medium).  A
partial list of suggested topics is included below:

      - the linguistic description of CMC -- spoken-like?
    graphic representation, discourse, register, style

      - CMC genres -- e-mail, bulletin boards (BBS), discussion
    lists, interactive relay chat (IRC), 'talk' modes,
    multi-user dungeons (MUDs), etc.

      - CMC and social interaction -- dynamics of on-line
    communities, politeness/rudeness, humor, harassment,
    computer sex

      - CMC use by dominant and non-dominant groups -- gender,
    ethnicity, status, special interests

      - CMC in countries outside the U.S.; cross-cultural CMC

      - CMC in institutional settings -- business, government,
    education

      - children's CMC

Papers surveying a topic or reporting on a large-scale ongoing
project are also welcome.

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
To be considered for inclusion in the volume, prospective authors
should submit to the volume editor the following:

1)  A 300-500 word abstract clearly outlining the problem, data,
methodology, and conclusions of the research to be reported on in the
paper, and

2)  A short biographical statement (no longer than 300 words)
indicating previous CMC research and/or relevant experience.  (An
abridged curriculum vita may be substituted for the biographical
statement.)

Submissions can be sent via e-mail, snail-mail or fax to the volume
editor, Susan Herring, at the address below:

    Susan Herring

    University of Texas
    Arlington, TX  76019  USA
fax: (817) 273-2731
e-mail: susan@utafll.uta.edu

The deadline for receipt of abstracts and biographical statements is
November 1, 1993.  However, earlier submissions are welcomed.

After the abstracts have been reviewed, the author of each abstract
selected will be issued an invitation to contribute a full-length
article to the volume, along with a set of guidelines for its
preparation.  The tentative deadline for the receipt of completed
camera-ready manuscripts will be February 1, 1994, with an anticipated
publication date early in 1995.

Actually, they have issued such legal guarantees.  They're in the form
of the administration's vow to uphold the US Constitution.  That
document's 9th and 10th amendments preclude US Government denial or
disparagement of the people's right to use cryptography (and a whole
lot of others).  The fact that these legal guarantees are being
ignored simply illustrates that their tyranny is unbridled.

By engaging NIST on this subject, the EFF is implicitly yielding to
them authority which is not theirs to begin with.

((MODERATORS' NOTE: Hugh Miller's request for reprints of articles
related to PGP/Phil Zimmermann is one way everybody can help. Peruse
your local papers and if you find anything, you can send him the

    I am interested in collecting all citations in newspapers,
magazines, etc. of the subpoenas and investigation by Customs of Phil
Zimmermann.  To that end I'd like to ask readers of CUD to help me
out.  If you spot an article would you please take a moment to jot
down the citation (author, title, publication, vol/issue, date, page
numbers)?  You don't need to type in the article, but blessings on
your head if you do.  I will conduct a weekly NEXIS scan anyway, but
I'm sure I'll miss something.  I will collect the stuff and pass it on
to Phil and the legal defense team.

    Thanks, folks.  Send the info to ME, not to Phil, whose bank

service that EFF can provide for the online community.

Below is the text of the comments that EFF filed with NIST today.

================================

September 27, 1993

National Institute for Standards and Technology
ATTN:  Proposed FIPS for Escrowed Encryption Standard
Technology Building, Room B-154
Gaithersburg, MD  20899

To The Director:

        The Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) writes in strong
opposition to the Proposed Federal Information Processing Standard
(FIPS) for an Escrowed Encryption Standard, docket # 930659-3159.  We
believe that NIST's guidance in setting technical standards for
security and privacy protection is a critical part of the growth of
the National Information Infrastructure, but any action on the
proposed escrow technical standards must await the resolution of
several fundamental policy issues.  Thus, at this time, we oppose the
proposed FIPS in all of its parts.  Well over 200 EFF members are also
critical of the Proposed FIPS.  We believe this demonstrates the depth
of public concern about the implementation of key escrow systems.

        EFF is a nonprofit, public interest organization whose public
policy mission is to ensure that the new electronic highways emerging
from the convergence of telephone, cable, broadcast, and other
communications technologies enhance free speech and privacy rights and
are open and accessible to all segments of society.

Introduction

        Widespread, affordable cryptography is vital for the
protection of individual privacy in the Information Age.  As more and
more personal information flows around electronic networks, we all
need strong encryption to safeguard information from unwanted
intrusion.  Personal information, such as health care records, private
communications among friends and families, and personal financial
transactions, will also travel over this information infrastructure.
The business community can only make full use of the infrastructure if
it is assured that the data it transmits is secure from unauthorized
interception.  In short, if communications in the new infrastructure
are vulnerable, all of our lives and businesses would be subject to
both damaging and costly privacy and security losses.

Resolve Policy Issues and Objectives Before Promulgating Technical Standards

        EFF has been in ongoing dialogue with NIST, the White House,
and Congress regarding the very complex public policy choices raised
by cryptography policy.  We are hopeful that this dialogue will result
in a positive, comprehensive set of cryptography and privacy policies.
But until these issues are resolved, we believe any approval of
technical standards is premature.  Among the public policy issues to
be resolved are the following:

1.      Guaranteed Continued Legal Use of All Forms of Encryption

        When the Clinton Administration announced the Clipper Chip, it
assured the public that this would be a purely voluntary system.  We
must have legal guarantees that Clipper is not the first step toward
prohibition against un-escrowed encryption.  Yet the Administration
has not offered any such guarantees, either in the form of proposed
legislation or even agency rules.

2.      Identity of Escrow Agents

        When Clipper was first proposed, some in the Administration
suggested that one of the two escrow agents would be a government
agency and the other a private, non-governmental organization.  Now it
appears that plans for a private escrow agent have been dropped in
favor of NIST and the Department of Treasury, though there is still no
final designation of agents.  We are unable to comment on the security
or reliability of escrow procedures proposed here when we do not know
who will be administering the escrow databases.  We also note that
there is active consideration of having more than two escrow agents.
This option should be explored from a policy perspective before a
technical standard is adopted.

3.      Legal Rights of Escrow Users

        If individuals do choose to deposit their keys with the
government, or any other escrow agent, they must have some legal
recourse in the event that those keys are improperly released.
However, the most recent draft of escrow procedures specifically
states:

"These procedures do not create, and are not intended to create, any
substantive rights for individuals intercepted through electronic
surveillance, and noncompliance with these procedures shall not
provide the basis for any motion to suppress or other objection to the
introduction of electronic surveillance evidence lawfully acquired."

Leaving users with no recourse will discourage use of the system and
provides little disincentive against unscrupulous government behavior.

        In the Proposed FIPS, NIST also suggests an unusual and, we
believe, incorrect notion of what an escrow agent is.  The Proposed
FIPS adopts the incomplete definition of an escrow system found in
Webster's Dictionary.  The Proposed FIPS states:

To escrow something (e.g., a document, an encryption key) means that
it is "delivered to a third person to be given to the grantee only
upon the fulfillment of a condition."  (Webster's Seventh New
Collegiate Dictionary).

This definition omits the very basic notion that an escrow agent has
responsibilities to those who deposit things of value in the escrow
account.  Black's Law Dictionary, which we believe may be a more
appropriate source of information about escrow relationships, states
that an escrow contract is an:

Agreement between buyer, seller, and escrow holder setting forth
rights and responsibilities of each.

It is the general legal rule that one who deposits value with an
escrow agent is entitled to recover damages from the escrow agent in
the event of a breach of the agent's duty of care:

Depositor is entitled to recover damages sustained because of escrow
agent's unwarranted act, and where grantee participates in wrongful
delivery he also may be liable, but recovery is limited to damages
actually attributable to wrongful delivery.  Collier v Smith (Mo App)
308 SW2d 779.  (See ANNOTATION:  Who must bear loss resulting from
defaults or peculations of escrow holder. 15 A.L.R.2d 870.)

The notion of an escrow agent who is insulated from all liability to
the depositor is wholly alien to American law and custom.  The
government may, of course, seek to establish escrow agents free of
legal liability, but this is fundamentally a policy choice, not a
matter of technical standards.
 Until there is some agreement on the real responsibilities of the
escrow agents, NIST is not in a position to set technical and
operating standards.

4.      Open, Trusted Standards:

        A key goal of the Clipper Proposal is to promote widespread
encryption in the marketplace.  Yet people will not use encryption
unless they trust it.  Secret standards such as Clipper cannot be
evaluated by independent experts and do not deserve the public trust.
Other parties, including Whitfield Diffie of Sun Microsystems, have
commented extensively on this issue.  EFF fully subscribes to those
remarks.

Insufficient Technical and Operating Information Available for
Comments

        Even aside from the major policy issues left unanswered, the
Proposed FIPS itself lacks the detail necessary to allow full public
comment.  First, the full operating procedures for the escrow agents
has yet to be issued.  Public comment must be sought on the complete
procedures, not just the outline presented in the draft FIPS.  Even
the government-selected algorithm review group has declared that it
needs more information on the escrow process.  Second, asking for
comments on an algorithm that is classified makes a mockery of citizen
participation in government decision-making.

Action on the Proposed FIPS Must Be Delayed to Allow Completion of
Public-Private Consultation Mandated by Presidential Decision
Directive

        President Clinton's announcement of the Clipper initiative
made very clear that there should be "early and frequent consultations
with affected industries, the Congress and groups that advocate the
privacy rights of individuals as policy options are developed" (April
16, 1993 Press Statement).  EFF and other organizations have invested
significant effort in dialogue and policy review with the
Administration.  We have made some progress, but many issues remain
unresolved.  EFF believes that for NIST to rush forward with a FIPS in
advance of resolving the fundamental policy issues cited above would
prematurely curtail the dialogue that the President ordered.

        Finally, NIST will be involved in making many critical
decisions regarding the National Information Infrastructure.  The next
time NIST solicits public comments, it should be ready to accept reply
by electronic mail in addition to paper-based media.  Over 200 of
EFF's members e-mailed comments to our offices, which we then printed
and hand-delivered to NIST.  We hope that in the near future, NIST and
other federal agencies will be prepared to accept comments directly
via the Internet.

Subject: File 8--Three Cheers for Legal Action; Re: Mody Crypto

In all the concern about the grand jury subpoenas to ViaCrypt and
Austin CodeWorks, a very important point is being missed:  This is the
way the law is *supposed* to work!  The law is not supposed to work by
FUD (Fear, Uncertainty and Doubt), by poorly drafted regulations whose
coverage no one can determine, by threats and insinuations from
government spokesmen that some action is illegal (though no one's ever
taken it to court so no one can really say yes or no).  That's exactly
what "casts a chill" over people's actions:  When they can't determine
what the law says or what its limits are, so that they are forced to
stay away from entire areas of activity that may not be illegal and
may even be Constitutionally protected.

Our system of law has many "inconvenient" little features to it.
People who are clearly guilty avoid punishment every day because of
errors by the prosecution or simply because the evidence against them
as it is accepted by the courts is not quite at a high enough level.
We accept that because "it's better that a hundred guilty men go free
than that one innocent man be pun-ished."  Conversely, the law is
what's on the books until the courts say otherwise.  The concurrence of
every single law professor in the United States that some statute is
unconstitutional means nothing until the Supreme Court rules.  The
ITAR regulations are presumptively valid until found otherwise by a
competent court of law.  Since they can only be examined by a court
when the government actually tries to use them, they can remain on the
books indefinitely as a looming threat - constitutional or not, a
prosecution under these regulations is expensive to defend against, so
expensive that most people and all large corporations will simply act
as if they are valid.  This may be as "inconvenient" in some cases as
letting murderers go free, but it's just as essential a part of the
legal system.

While I don't envy Phil Zimmerman or ViaCrypt or Austin CodeWorks the
position they find themselves in, or the legal bills they will be
facing, they went into this with open eyes.  (If they didn't, they are
fools who won't get my sympathy.)  The only way to challenge a law you
think is unconstitutional is to violate it and let the government come
to you.  I wish them luck in their challenge.  One way or another, we
are likely to finally end the silly debates about secret decoder rings
and decide what the law is.

As for Grady Ward's call on everyone to secrete away and widely
distribute copies of PGP and related software:  All I can say is, he'd
better hope that the courts don't decide that the ITAR regulations
aren't constitutional as applied to PGP after all.  Calling on people
to break the law, especially cooperating with them to do it on a large
scale, could open him up to much more severe penalties than Zimmerman,
ViaCrypt, and Austin face.  Those three are testing the law.  Ward is
deliberately flaunting it.  Stupid, dangerous idea.  Being a
revolutionary, putting yourself in direct opposition to the power of
the State, isn't fun and games.  People get hurt that way.
