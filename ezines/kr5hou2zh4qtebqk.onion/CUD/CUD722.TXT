Subject: File 1--CuD Listserv at UIUC having some problems

The UIUC Listserv continues having some problems. People subscribing to
CuD with standard internet addresses should be relatively
unaffected. Those with BITNET addresses will likely not
receive CuD this (or next) issue.

This means that folks unsubbing, whether through us or through the
listserv, may not get unsubbed for a few more days. Those adding
directly through the listserv should wait a few days, and then
re-submit the request.

   "CLIFF STOLL CAN'T SAY THAT, CAN HE?" or NOTHIN' BUT GOOD TIMES
                     AHEAD IN "SILICON SNAKE OIL"

I don't know if Cliff Stoll ever met historian Christopher Lasch, but
if he did they certainly would have had a lot to talk about. Just
before his death, Lasch closed his last book, "The Revolt of the
Elites" with a biting assessment of the current mania with technology:

"Those wonderful machines that science has enabled us to construct
have not eliminated drudgery, as . . . other false prophets so
confidently predicted, but they have made it possible to imagine
ourselves as masters of our fate.  In an age that fancies itself as
disillusioned, this is the one illusion - the illusion of mastery that
remains as tenacious as ever."

Stoll's "Silicon Snake Oil: Second Thoughts on the Information
Highway" (Doubleday) is steel-plated with the same underlying idea,
that much of what is said blindly exTOLLing <heh-heh, couldn't resist>
networks, interconnectivity and computing is illusory - at best
exaggerated, at worst, completely fabricated.  Of course, there have
been other books which hoe the same row.  Lauren Ruth Wiener's
"Digital Woes" and Theodore Roszak's The Cult of Information," both
excellent, come to mind.  But neither deliver the same engaging
personal style Stoll effortlessly inserts into "SSO" which is a
greater read for it.

The book deals directly with the mysterious mental disease that is now
infecting large numbers of seemingly rational and very vocal people:
That computers are the new philosopher stones of American society,
capable of transforming the lead of inequality, crumbling public
education; unresponsive, corrupt political processes; stagnant career
opportunity; or the moribund sex life into different varieties of
revitalized techno-alchemical gold. And it means for the greater part
of the making of "Silicon Snake Oil," Stoll must have been sleeping
with his bullshit detector plugged in.  However, he's more gracious,
calling it his "bogometer."

To wit:

"In physics, you measure the brightness of light with a photometer and
voltages with a voltmeter.  Bogosity -- the degree to which something
is bogus - is measured with a bogometer," Stoll writes.

"Alan November, a consultant for the Glenbrook high schools in
Illinois, believes that today's students are in the test preparation
business.  In the May/June 1994 issue of _Electronic Learning_, he
says that pupils will soon build information products that can be used
by clients around the world.  Teachers, in turn, will become brokers
'connecting our students to others across the nets who will help them
create and add to their knowledge.' That one pegged my bogometer."

Mine too.

Passages like these are a delight to the closet curmudgeon. A mere
thirty pages earlier, Stoll notes "I've also noticed that the computer
cognoscenti hang on to their jobs by creating systems where they are
at the chokepoints of the organizations.  Workers who don't know
computers get trampled, discounted or pushed to the side."

As for information being free?  Bah, Stoll indicates.  "I hear this
from those who duplicate software or break into computers.  It's
techno-Marxism -- abolish private property and we'll all be happy."
The Free Software Foundation, writes Stoll, claims "that copyrights
harm society by preventing the free flow of information."  You can
tell he doesn't believe much of it.  Slogans and cyber-aphorisms of
this nature are conveniences in 1995, usually used to rationalize the
process of someone else, but never the individual spouting said
cliches, being ripped off.

I would suspect little, if any, of this will endear Stoll to the
disciples of the church of Toffler now encamped within the gilded
walls of the mainstream media. That's good.  He also has doubtless
alienated the cypherpunks movement by essentially stating that while
their technical accomplishments are neat, the problem they're trying
to solve - the preservation of information privacy through the employ
of cumbersome, almost unusable anonymous remailers and cumbersome,
almost unusable encryption technology - looms trivial in the global
picture.  In fact, "Silicon Snake Oil" gores so many sacred cows in
cyberspace it's guaranteed the author will be regarded like a
dysenteric hog loose in the streets of Mecca on some parts of the net.

That would be a shame because "Silicon Snake Oil" has genuine heart.
There's not a mean bone in it; neither will you find the sour breath
of the corrosive cynic. Paradoxically, Stoll confounds the reader's
expectations by appearing to be a hopeless romantic in everyday life,
and, by contrast, the nets, where he is up to his neck in connections
and still very obviously in love with the pulse of the cursor.  In the
end, "Silicon Snake Oil" is saying the future could be a pretty dim,
brutish place if we trade the critical and analytical capacity, stuff
that ain't broke, a real voice on the end of the telephone line or the
tough teacher for the newest software, indigestible floods of
valueless, curiosity-numbing information or glib futurology that is
simply faster and louder than real life.  That's a great message from
a killer of a book.

        This is classic sensitive waffling on free speech...everyone is in
favor of it, but they'd really rather that it be restricted to speech
they're comfortable with.  If no one_wants_it to happen, then why are
the alt.binaries and alt.sex groups consistently in the highest
traffic and usage groups on the net?  The whole point of the
exepmtion of common carriers from obscenity laws to date is to allow
them to operate, period; as any efforts at censorship will run them
afoul of the various Electronic Privacy acts, such as the Wiretap
Act.  S.314 requires operators of BBS's and Net services to
excersise just suchcensorship, to protect themselves from liability.
Yet they are, in all senses of the word, common carriers...you do not
have to be a giant monopolistic corporate entity to be one.  They are
providing a connection service, not a content service; there is no
legal reason on earth that they should have to be responsible for the
content of what they are conveying, any more that the phone company
is.  Drug deals, insider trading, and even murder conspiracies are
conducted by phone every day, yet the phone company is not held as a
co-conspirator, nor are they held on liability charges for the
millions of sex-line calls made using their networks each day.
However, this is precisely what this proposed law is setting out to
do for computer networks.  This bill is a chilling attack on out
first amendment rights using a convenient scapegoat (remember no one
really _wants_ people to be passing around pornography) in a new, and
largely legally uncharted communications medium.  Were I to go in for
conspiracy theory, I'd almost suspect that the large telcos were
behind this bill...it removes a heck of a lot of competition, and
when they finally bring networking to the unwashed masses, they'll
have their historical protections as common carriers and phalanxes of
lawyers, congress-critters and pr flacks to throw against it.

Subject: File 4--J. Baker/U of Mich Speech Case -- Chic Trib Excerpt)

Source:  The Chicago Tribune, 12 March, 1995 (Perspective Section, p. 1)
By:  Joan H. Lowenstein

                      HOW FREE IS SPEECH IN CYBERSPACE?

   While other University of Michigan students worked on their tans
over spring break, one sophomore sat in a federal prison cell
typically occupied by extortionists and drug dealers.

   The U.S. attorney in Detroit argued that 20-year-old Jake Baker was
a time bomb-so likely to commit a serious crime like rape or murder
that he shouldn't be allowed out of jail.

   Baker, who was finally released on bail Friday, says he's a
political prisoner, a 1st Amendment hero who is being punished for
testing the limits of free speech in cyberspace. His lawyers say he
spent a month in jail for a crime that may consist of nothing more
than exceptionally bad manners.

   They may be right.

((The story summarizes the case -- see CuD # for details))

   Sex on the information superhighway is no different from sex on the
old information dirt roads like books and magazines. But the risk of
the unknown can be scary, and people typically react to new
communication technologies by trying to rein them in.

   The advent of the printing press so stunned the medieval Catholic
Church that it had to create an imprimatur to control the output of
all texts. When radio became popular, Congress passed laws that made
sure the government could control the airwaves in case of war. And
more recently, the proliferation of cable television has sparked
legislation-so far unsuccessful-that attempts to regulate sex and
violence.

((The reporter provides an accurate summary of SB 314 - the "Decency"
Bill))

   Ironically, had the University of Michigan acted quietly to
determine whether anyone was really in danger, alt.sex.stories readers
might never have known that the victim in Baker's story was a real
person. But instead, university President James Duderstadt summarily
suspended Baker from school, bringing on considerable media attention
and revealing the woman.

((The story provides additional information on the background -- see
CuD #)).

   A Detroit federal grand jury has since indicted Baker for violating
Section 875(c) of the U.S. Criminal Code: "Whoever transmits in
interstate or foreign commerce any communication containing any threat
to kidnap any person or any threat to injure the person of another
shall be fined not more than $1,000 or imprisoned not more than 5
years, or both."

   Citing his "gut feeling" that he wouldn't want his daughter out on
the streets if Baker were set free, a federal magistrate in Detroit at
first denied bond.

   The case has attracted attention because it's the first time the
federal government has made an Internet posting the subject of the
anti-threat law.  But the medium is not as important as the message in
determining the merit of Baker's primary defense-that he was
exercising his 1st Amendment right to freedom of expression.

((The story summarizes and excerpts parts of the story from the
indictment))

   It's not the first time a person charged under the threat statute
has claimed exaggerated or offensive language shouldn't be punished.
In November 1974, when PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat was scheduled to
address the United Nations in New York, Jewish Defense League member
Russell Kelner called a news conference and, in response to a question
from a television reporter, said, "We are planning to assassinate Mr.
Arafat, just the way any other murderer is treated."

((The story summarizes the case, noting that the US Supreme Court drew
on a 1969 decision upholding a statute prohibiting threatening the
President of the US)).

   Jake Baker's conduct doesn't begin to reach the severity of true
threats punished under this rarely used statute.

   In one case prosecuted under the law, the threatening language was,
"I am going to blow your brains out." In another, a woman's
ex-boyfriend left a message on her answering machine that said, "Your
husband's health will take a turn for the worse and you will be
widowed."

   Although the woman he named in the fictional story could bring a
civil suit against him for invasion of privacy or infliction of
emotional distress, it seems unlikely that prosecutors will be able to
show that Jake Baker made the kind of unequivocal and immediate threat
the courts have required for conviction on the criminal charge.

((A brief discussion of internet participation deleted)

   Baker's case has been assigned to Detroit Federal Judge Avern Cohn,
a jurist who has often shown his sensitivity to the 1st Amendment.

   Five years ago, Cohn severely chastised the University of Michigan
for enacting a speech code that violated the free speech rights of its
students.

   Although it can foist some of the blame on the FBI, the university
soon may have to extend its wrist before the judge once again.

[3/17/95:
 Yet even more organizations have joined us.  Welcome aboard!

 Next week (Mar 23, 1995) the telecomm reform bill will be marked up in
 the Commerce committee.  If the Communications Decency Act is added to
 the reform bill as an amendment, it will be *very difficult to stop*.
 The result of this bill becoming a law will be to change the nature of
 the Internet as we know it.  The volume of information we take for
 granted will slow to a trickle.

 Win this battle, and we've won the fight for this year and stopped the
 bill.   Lose it and we'll be on the ropes in the Senate for the rest
 of the session.

 Only you can make the difference, and it will only take two minutes.

   at the bottom if you need to.


2. Feel free to use the following communique:

   SAMPLE COMMUNIQUE

        I'm a resident of _______.  Please support Senator Leahy's
        efforts to explore alternatives to S. 314.  Please keep S. 314
        out of the telecommunications reform bill, and remove S. 314
        from the fast track.

        Thanks.



   See below for a brief description of Leahy's initiative. His letter
   to CDT is in the VTW gopher.

   Concern over S.314 is not limited to the U.S. Among many international
   expressions of support, two have stood out in the first two weeks.
   EF-Australia is a member of the growing coalition, and IndiaNet has
   circulated our alert widely. If you are not a citizen of the United States
   you can still express your concern. A sample message to Senator Pressler
   follows:

        Dear Senator Pressler:

        The Exon bill will cripple the U.S. portion of the Internet
        and thereby devastate the growing global information community.
        Internation commerce and social and political cooperation will
        suffer greatly. I urge you to refrain from incorporating S.314
        into any telecommunications reform legislation and to support
        Senator's Leahy initiatives to explore alternatives to S314.

   Both US citizens and non-US citizens should remember to be polite
   when speaking to legislators, even their own.

3. DON'T FORGET TO DROP A NOTE TO VTW@VTW.ORG to tell us who you contacted.
   (See below for FTN -> Internet emailing instructions.)
   We'll tally the results and feed them back to all participating
   organizations.  It's crucial we have this feedback, even if you just
   got a form letter, or a "thank you" to your phone call.

   Please, when you report back, tell us what state you are in!  This
   will help us track constituent calls, which are the most effective.

4. Feel good about yourself.  You've just participated in democracy
   without leaving your seat.

5. (Extra bonus activism)  Pass this alert to your friends, especially if
   they're in South Dakota, Nebraska, or Oregon.  These states need to
   have as much constituent contact with their Senators as possible.

   Also, you might send a thank-you note to Sen. Patrick Leahy (D-VT) for
   his continuing efforts on behalf of free speech and the free flow of

INTRODUCTION

Dear Net Citizens:

Legislation has been introduced before the Senate which would severely
restrict your freedom of speech, halt the free flow of information on
the net, and require all telecommunications carriers to censor your
public and private communications.

The "Communications Decency Act of 1995" (S. 314), introduced in early
February by Senators Exon (D-NE) and Gorton (R-WA), would place
substantial criminal liability on telecommunications carriers (including
traditional telephone networks, Internet service providers, commercial
online services such as America Online and Compuserve, and independent
BBS's) whenever their networks are used to transmit any material
which is deemed indecent or harassing.  In order to avoid these penalties,
carriers would be forced to restrict the activities of their subscribers
and censor all public and private communications.

We must act quickly to stop the progress of S. 314.  The bill may soon
be incorporated into Senate telecommunications reform legislation, which
is currently being drafted by the Senate Commerce Committee.  The
telecommunications reform bill may be introduced as early as mid March,
and is expected to be considered on a fast track.  If S. 314 is included
in this bill, it will be extremely difficult to change or remove and
could pass quickly.

We are asking you to join us in urging key members of the Senate to
prevent S. 314 from being included in Senate telecommunications reform
measures and to hold open, public hearings on the issue.

---------------------------------------------------------------------
CURRENT STATUS OF S. 314/H.R. 1004

The bill was introduced on February 1, 1995 by Senators Exon (D-NE) and
Gorton (R-WA).  It is currently pending before the Senate Commerce
Committee (chaired by Senator Pressler (R-SD)).

No committee action has been scheduled as of March 9, 1995.

The telecommunications reform bill is scheduled for hearing starting
March 21, 1995.  It is possible that S. 314 will be folded into the
bill during markup next week.

H.R. 1004 (worded the same as S. 314) was introduced on February 21,
1995 in the House by Representative Johnson (SD) and has been referred
to the House Commerce and Judiciary committees.

No committee actions in the House have been scheduled as of March 17, 1995.

BACKGROUND

S. 314 would expand current law restricting indecency and harassment on
telephone services to all telecommunications providers and expand
criminal liability to all content carried by all forms of
telecommunications networks.  The bill would amend Section 223 of the
Communications Act (47 U.S.C. 223), which requires carriers to take
steps to prevent minors from gaining access to indecent audiotext and
criminalizes harassment accomplished over interstate telephone lines.

If enacted, S. 314 would compel service providers to severely restrict
your online activities.  Your access to email, discussion lists, usenet,
the world wide web, gopher, and ftp archives would be substantially
reduced or cut off entirely. The bill would also force providers to
closely monitor and pre-screen your electronic mail, and refuse to
transmit any message or other content which may be considered to be
indecent.

This bill poses a significant threat to freedom of speech and the free
flow of information in cyberspace. The bill also raises fundamental
questions about the right of government to control content on
communications networks, as well as the locus of liability for content
carried in these new communications media.

Recently, Sen. Patrick Leahy (D-VT) has requested the Center for
Democracy and Technology's Public Interest/Industry working group IWG
(Interactive Working Group) to explore other solutions to the problems
that S. 314 attempts to solve.  The working group must be allowed to
examine current legislation and explore technical alternatives that are
consistent with the First Amendment and the free flow of information.

We've received over 400 messages in two weeks, with our log showing
over 700 letters, faxes, phone calls, and email messages (many people
contacted more than one Senator. At least two respondents wrote all 19
members of the committee!)  Of course many more people have probably
contacted Congress without sending that note to VTW.

Almost 200 messages went to Pressler, who may be getting the point.
His staff told one caller, "Why are you calling us? It's Exon's bill!"
(This is why phone calls to Pressler are so important.)

One citizen wrote to Senator Gorton, a co-sponsor:
        "I, frankly, am amazed at the audacity of your proposed
         bill. We are not children sir, nor do we need your
         misplaced guidance in raising our children!"

Along the same lines, another wrote to his own Senator:
        "While I am pleased, being an enthusiastic supporter of
         anti-harassment legislation, with many of the provisions of
         this bill, I am frankly astounded and appalled with others."

Someone came up with metaphor that frankly we aren't clever enough to
have thought of:
        "A few years ago, a tanker laden with a crude, noxious substance
         ran aground in the virginal territories of the Alaskan coastline.
         It poisoned the land and sea for many miles around.... We are now
         faced with another 'Exon Valdez'...  a vehicle filled with crude
         legislation, currently at risk of running ashore on our pristine
         rights."

Finally, someone writing to Pressler spoke for all of us to all of us:
        "At a time when communications between ordinary citizens has
         been all but drowned out by the barrage of mass media, online
         communication has become the last bastion of real citizen
         deliberation and has become the "public square" so to speak,
         of the nation.  This bill would destroy this great experiment
         in the rejuvenation of grassroots democracy.  Please do all
         you can to prevent its passage."

We are encouraged by the success so far of the campaign, and hope that
you take the time to participate at this crucial time.

WHERE CAN I LEARN MORE ABOUT THE BILL? (URL INCLUDED)

The Voters Telecommunications Watch has set up a gopher page where
you can get a copy of the bill (including analyses by the American
Civil Liberties Union, the Center for Democracy and Technology, the
Electronic Messaging Association, and others).  Here's the URL:

        WWW URL: gopher://gopher.panix.com/11/vtw/exon
        Gopher command : gopher -p 1/vtw/exon gopher.panix.com

If you have difficulty getting to this gopher page, or if you don't
have access to Mosaic/gopher, drop a note to:

        vtw@vtw.org

BBS Network Users:

You can FREQ the files from the EFF BBS, 1:109/1108, 1-202-861-1224.
The "magicword" for a list of relevant files is S314.  You do NOT have to be
nodelisted to get the files, or in any particular network.  Just create a
dummy nodelist entry with our phone number if you need to do so.
Those in QWK nets or otherwise not able to File REQuest can download the
files manually from the BBS, in the ALERTS file area.  Feel free to login
as ANONYMOUS, password GUEST to bypass newuser questionnaires.

To send mail to vtw@vtw.org from FidoNet or other FTN systems, create a
netmail message to your local UUCP host.  Search the nodelist for the
GUUCP flag, and use the address of that system:

To: UUCP, [GUUCP system's address here.  "To:" name MUST be set to UUCP]
From: [you]
Subject--S.314
---------------------------------------------------------------
To: vtw@vtw.org

[Message starts here on 3rd line.  The second "To:" line with the internet
email address MUST be the first line of the message body, and the blank
line following that is REQUIRED.  Mail will not be delivered by the gateways
without it.]

To email one of the Senators in the list above, just put the Senator's email
address in place of "vtw@vtw.org" in the above example.

If you are unsure whether your FTN has an Internet gateway, or suspect it
may use something other than a GUUCP nodelist flag, ask your network
coordinators.
