MISC. ITEMS:

--CUD and USENET: Chip Rosenthal is investigating the possiblity of setting up
a group gateway into USENET for a newsgroup called alt.cud to
stimulate debate and dialogue of issues. If all goes as planned, it
will happen very soon. We will keep people posted.

--SUBSCRIPTIONS:
If you have requested to be added to the mailing list but have
not received anything from us, keep trying and include several
alternative addresses. Sometimes neither "reply" nor the addresses
listed work.
CuD is available hardcopy, and we will provide back issues to
libraries or other archival sources at no cost.

MAIL--We receive considerable mail, but we cannot print it all.
We strongly encourage comments to be related to the general issues
reflected here, and we will not print flames, insults, or general
opinions unless there is some additional (and strong) redeeming
value. We *STRONGLY* encourage law enforcement and others to
submit comments or articles as a way of stimulating dialogue and
understanding.
