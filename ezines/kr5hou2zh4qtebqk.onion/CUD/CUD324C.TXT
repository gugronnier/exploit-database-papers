 Houston, TX, Comsec Data Security announced its entrance into the
 field of computer security consulting.  Comsec, comprised mainly of
 the now defunct computer group "The Legion of Doom," plans to offer a
 full-scale security package to private industry.

 The firm's officers are Scott Chasin, Robert Cupps, Chris Goggins and
 Ken Shulman.  The three key computer specialists Chasin, Goggins and
 Shulman, all ex-members of LOD, each have over eight years experience
 dealing with computer security.  Cupps, a graduate of Emory School of
 Business and former securities trader, will operate as the firm's
 administrative partner and concentrate on the firm's marketing
 efforts.

 Since it's formation in the summer of 1984, the Legion of Doom had
 been the object of much controversy in the media.  Often referred to
 as "the most notorious hacker group in America," LOD underwent four
 major reorganizations of members.  Goggins, one of the original nine
 founding members of the group said of the final reorganization, "we
 were looking for individuals who had the skills and desire to move
 the group specifically to this point.

 "We feel that we are bringing a fresh approach to security consulting
 in the corporate marketplace.  We were all the cream of the crop of
 the computer underground and know precisely how systems are
 compromised and what actions to take to secure them," said Goggins.
 In fact, the group feels its success rate in the area of system
 penetration is 80 to 85 percent.

 Comsec will offer security penetration testing and full auditing
 services to corporate clients.  In addition, the firm aims to endorse
 a wide range of software and hardware security products. "Our firm
 has taken a unique approach to its sales strategy and is confident
 that contracts currently under negotiation will firm up within the
 next 30 days," said Cupps.

 Aware of the possible shockwave among the hacking underground over
 this venture, the firm maintains that they are security consultants
 and not informants or hacker-trackers.  "We are not going to go after
 people, we are going to ensure that no one, hacker or corporate spy,
 can compromise the security of our clients computers," said Chasin.

 Comsec is ready to assume normal operations and is looking to provide
 the business community with a much needed service.  Comsec is located
 at 60 Braeswood Square, in Houston, Texas, and can be reached at
 713-721-6500 or 713-683-5742 (A/ hrs).
