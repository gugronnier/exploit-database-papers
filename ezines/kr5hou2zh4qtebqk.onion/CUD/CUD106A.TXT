Call for Articles
------------

It's the busy time of the term, but we're hoping people will send more
articles on various topics. In this issue we review Clifford Stoll's THE
CUCKOO'S EGG, and we'd like to get some pro or con responses on the book,
as well as publish a few more articles on it from various perspectives.

In a previous issue of C-u-D, a typo slipped by: THERE ARE ONLY THREE
issues of LoD Technical Journal. The fourth was in progress.  Most of those
files were destroyed, but if anybody received any advance drafts or has any
of those files laying around, please send them. They would be a nifty
addition to the archives, and we're hoping that issue is not lost forever.

SO--send those articles in!

-------------------
More Crackdowns?
-------------------

The computer underground isn't the only target of enforcement or
legislative crackdowns. The CHICAGO TRIBUNE (April 20) reports two more
"crimes" that can result either in heavy penalties or in confiscation of
possessions.

In Illinois, a law is being considered that would make it a felony to give
*ANY* minor a drink of alcohol. On the suface, this seems a reasonable law,
but it also outlaws parents allowing their 20-year old offspring a sip of
wine under their supervision in the privacy of their home or a sip of wine
at private religious ceremony at home. The penalty is THREE YEARS IN PRISON
AND A FINE OF UP TO $10,000! (CHICAGO TRIBUNE, April 20, p. II-1).

In Wisconsin, "the governor signed a law authorizing authorities to seize
and sell cars used in prostitution crimes, a measure aimed at increasing
the pressure on customers" (CHICAGO TRIBUNE, April 20, p. I-3).

Laws originally used to fight drugs and racketeering are being expanded to
criminalize and punish in ways not originally intended. We seem to be
living in a time when special interest groups (and not so special interest
groups) are attempting to criminalize all those behaviors to which they
object and impose potentially cruel and unusual punishments, or at least
extreme punishments. It's hard to be sympathetic toward a drug pusher, so
when harsh laws were passed, few objected. But, now those laws are being
expanded and the confiscation of personal property seems to be in vogue.
Isn't it time to "JUST SAY NO!?"

---------------
LoD Rumors
---------------

Some of the most outlandish rumors have come to us about the LoD events. We
have heard that some are in jail, some have been indicted for treason, that
Mentor was awoken with a shotgun at his head...the list goes on. We have
reprinted the events as they occured in previous issues, and will keep
subscribers up to date.  The sources for our information include
participants on both sides of the case, and despite the predictable slants
each side may have, the facts are consistent, so we consider the
information accurate.  So, c'mon--tell others to quit spreading rumors!
