CuD Survey
+++++++++++++++

We thank everybody who filled out the CuD survey and thanks to Pat Townson for
printing it in Telecom Digest. The response was far, far better than expected,
and Bob Krause will have the results as soon as he tabulates them.  Because of
the volume, it may take a few weeks. Names and all identifying references are,
of course, removed.

+++++++++++++++++
Computer Security Conference
+++++++++++++++++

Coming Next Issue:  An eyewitness report on the National Computer Security
Conference held last week in Washington, D.C.  CuD's coverage will be
limited to a single article unless someone else contributes! If you attended
the NCSC (and we know many of you did!) why not jot down a few
thoughts/observations and send them in?  Alternate views, reviews,
comments, and summaries are all welcome.

Correction on ATI

Gremlins in the keyboard mistyped---ATI stands for
ACTIVIST TIMES, INC.,  (*NOT* "Anarchist")--
