Copyright Article Information
+++++++++++++++

CuD is *NOT* copyright, and articles by moderators, anonymous articles, and
other articles may be reprinted as long as the source is attributed.
However, occasionally an individual article is copyright protected. The
article in CuD 2.08 by Jim Warren on "PCs and Political Organizing" is an
example of a submission that is copyprotected but remains freely available
for others' use. We have heard horror tales of authors who make public
posts and then later find their material plagiarized and copyright
protected under another's name. So, do not copyright others' material as
your own. That's tacky--very, very tacky.  If a CuD article is listed as
copyright (this notice was excluded from Jim Warren's article), you should
check directly with that author (not CuD) for permission to reprint it.

Bibliographic Resources

We are trying to compile a list of bibliographic sources related to the CU
to eventually place in the archives. If you are writing term paper,
conference papers, or articles, or if you come across books, legal cases,
or other references that seem relevant, send the full citation over to us.
If you come across new books, or better, if you do a book review, send the
titles or the review along as well.
