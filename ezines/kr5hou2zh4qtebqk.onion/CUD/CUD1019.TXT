From what I'm reading here, you think that censorship of any kind is
bad. Even the right of a parent to control the information a child
receives. Not the guvmint, not censorware, but the parent. Correct?

>It is comforting to me to believe that we are very concerned with child

My comments have nothing to do with political agendas. No one has the
right to tell me what is best for my children, not the censors not the
anti-censors. They are not raising my kids, I am.

Wrong, at least in my case. I will discuss any subject they bring up as
honestly and as completely as I am able. I note generalizations in this
paragraph while the whole point of my earlier comments is how I, and no
one else live my life and raise my children.

>Controlling and monitoring are distinct activities.  I heartily approve

>I do not approve of controlling it to the extent that any information

And here is the point of disagreement. While I agree that there is a
great resiliancy is kids, there are also many things they cannot handle
until they have had a chance to grow. I have spent many nights awake,
comforting one of my children because of an image, idea, or occurance
that happened in their life that they were, at the time, unable to
handle. I would protect my kids from that when I can.

That remains to be seen, however it is mere speculation.

True, what a child learns in grade school differs enormously from high
school, but then so does the child's worldview and maturity.

You betcha. It has persisted because someone will always try to
subjegate another. Someone will always want to take what another has.
And when it reaches a point where it affects nations, war is inevitable.
Hoping it will go away is just wishful thinking.

>Frightened, shocked and confused.  That's how I feel about war.  What
>about you?

No I don't. Instead I want them to feel confident, knowlegable, and
aware. War is horrible, the premature death of any individual should be
considered the greatest outrage against mankind. This is a feeling that
should be instilled in all people, children and adults alike. But to
live in such fear of fighting that not to fight if and when it becomes
necessary goes against everything I believe in.

>> I don't and will do everything I can to
>> block such sights from them until I think they're ready.
>"Ready", how?  Ready to accept such sights unemotionally?

No, not unemotionally but instead mature enough to see them as the
horrors they are, not the horrors a small child can imaging them to be.
Little children take most everything they see, hear, and learn very
personally. They do not see it as history but as immediate and now. They
see these things as something that could happen to them that very day.
They do not see it as something that has happened and good people
everywhere are trying to prevent from happening again.

I was also disturbed and confused when I learned about the camps. The
pictures and movies I saw still haunt me at times. I still cannot
understand the motivation for such atrocities. It is completely alien to
my thinking.

I have no idea when I first saw such things, but I must have been at an
age when the emotions they generated were not revulsion so much as rage
that this could happen. And that is the emotion I want my kids to feel,
not revulsion so great that they hide from it but rage that it could
happen and should never happen again.

True, we only disagree on the extent and at what age a child should be
shown the images of war.

I won't prohibit my children from learning anything. I will try to
protect them from things I don't think they are ready to handle. But if
they do find out about a subject, I won't prevent them. In fact, it
means that I miss-judged their ability and maturity and will encourage
them. But at the same time, the whole point of my original post is that
I AM the judge, not some faceless guvmint or software publisher. I do
not, and will not use any type of screening software. I don't rely on
movie rating or other nonsense that this country tries to use to protect
us from ourselves. I will not surrender to anyone my right to raise my
children the way I believe they should be raised. And when I have to do
that by censorship, I do.

But you learned about the draft in other ways. The point here is that
your mother was exercising her right and duty to raise her son the way
she saw best.  Right or wrong, I do not fault her for trying.

You are reading much more into my words than I wrote. It is not
abrogation of responsibility but the exercise of responsiblitly that I
am talking about. Censorship plays only a small part in my raising of my
kids, but it does play a part and I will not give up my right to use it.

>You lead by example.  Regardless of your motives, the value you are

Again, no. Just to the point I feel they are ready to handle it. I do
not keep things from a 13 year old, I think they are on the path to
adulthood and probably ready for whatever they encounter. But I would
from a 7 year old.

>Perhaps they will learn this lesson well, and use it on you.  Watch out
>for the teen years.

My kids are teens, and raised using the methods I've tried to describe.
Two have graduated high school already, one is a senior. My son is
heavily into computers and is now apprenticed to a computer graphics
firm to learn the business. My oldest daughter is saving money for her
schooling (a value instilled), and the youngest wants to be a writer and
artist. I am proud of my kids.

>they're "ready".  Or supervise them.  But don't surrender your parental

Again, I DO NOT surrender my responsibilities, not to the censors, not
to the others who think differently from me.

>systems that will sterilize the 'net.

You are free to say anything you wish and learn anything you wish, I
support that wholeheartedly. But then so am I. And if you say something
that I would see as detrimental to my children I would block it from
them. I don't lend support to cockamamie rating systems, nor do I want
to see anything like mandatory censorship of the net or anything else. I
only want to make it clear that I will not give up my duties as a parent
and the tools I have available, including censorship, to anyone.

I am curious about the tax writeoffs you mention, I can't remember ever
getting a break.:^)

>I don't mind too much if some parents choose to keep their kids ignorant,
>but not anyone else's, and certainly not the world at large.

It is not ignorance I support, but what as I see as responsible
parenting. My methods have worked for me. My kids are the proof. My
biggest objection is ANYONE telling me that what I do with and for my
family is wrong because it does not agree with what they think is right.
I don't do it to others, do not do it to me.

Peace.

I am surprised that nobody mentioned another old standard, UUCP.  It
was passing news and email long before the Internet.  It works via direct
connections over the phone lines.  It is not a great replacement for
"the Internet", but in a pinch, it is would certainly be much better
than nothing at all.  So the trick is, prepare now to bring up a UUCP
network in a crisis, if you are concerned about this.  Virtually all
Unix systems have UUCP support, and I have seen UUCP on DOS systems
as well.

Subject: File 3--Fwd: Does John Q. Public understand software complexity?

I dare say he does not. If the general public understood the realities of
software design, development, testing, documentation and maintenance -
simply
put, what an incredible amount of work it all is - we wouldn't be having
problems like a "sudden" 2YK crisis ("what do you mean there isn't enough
time to fix all systems, there are almost two years left and it's just a
few 0s!") and even software piracy would probably not be as widespread as
it is ("hey, it's not stealing - besides, it's absurd what those lazy, fat
cat programmers would have you pay for a few lines of code").

That's why I came up with the idea for the contest at

http://www.polyhedric.com/software/acid/contest.html

Taking part is very simple: all you have to do is guess the size of the
source code for a new, moderately complex program (available for download
at the same site). Get it right to within ten lines and you win a free
user
license. More importantly, you will have given some thought to the
complexity of a minuscule part of "cyberspace", hopefully gaining some
insight in the process. At least, that's the idea.

So how is it working out? Well, I've just had the first answers sent over
-
both the contest and the software are brand new - and it's even worse than
I thought. So bad in fact that the deadline for submissions may have to be
extended beyond the originally planned date of April 6. If not, we may not
even have somebody land in the right ballpark.

We already have the terms "illiteracy" and (semi-officially) "innumeracy",
but I think the time has come to coin a counterpart for the information
age.

Subject: File 4--Brian Milburn thread

Re: the CyberSitter issue - I have 2 daughters who are now both in
college so I might be able to provide an additional perspective on this
issue.

At some point, usually in high school but certainly by college, even the
most vigilant parent has to trust that what they've taught their child
is sufficient preparation for them to go it on their own.

If all that a parent has taught a child is to obey the dictates set
down, then they've done a poor job of preparing that child to make
decisions on their own. The child might make a good soldier or prison
guard but certainly not anyone creative.

As far as limiting access on the net, at some age it might be wise to
involve the child in making decisions about what to block. Of course,
this would require that reasons be given to the child for such
censorship and a parent should be aware that the reasons given now will
be re-examined by the child at an older age - relying on trickery or
poor logic is unwise.

As for parental discretion within software that limits children's
access: if I were the author of such a product, my goal would be to have
a default setting that would reflect my standards for children  or
possibly what I perceived to be the standards of the parents likely to
use my product with the option for parents to easily adjust the default
settings.

I suspect that many parents think they can take software like
CyberSitter and plug it in to relieve themselves of the responsibility
of participating in their child's usage of the net.

While I think that a child should be allowed the chance to explore the
net on their own, I also think that a parent who truly cares about a
child would want to be part of his/her net experience just as they would
want to be part of other aspects of a child's life. No one would expect
a parent to take a test for a child or to be at bat for them in a little
league game. Why expect a parent to act in place of a child's discretion
on the net?

IMHO, a child is a person with qualities to be discovered and brought
out, not some piece of material to be hammered into something you wish
you could have been.

If you *must* force some dogma on your children, at least make it
something that you've thought out rather than some "conventional wisdom"
that you've unthinkingly accepted.

The Netly News / Afternoon Line
March 4, 1998

Loin-cloth

   One lawmaker who doesn't seem to have much of a sense of humor about
   titillating web sites is Sen. Lauch Faircloth (R-N.C.). When his
   presumably technology-impaired staffer stumbled across whitehouse.com
   and found not Hillary Clinton's child care proposals but a doctored
   photo of Hillary in leather, Faircloth decided to take action. "I plan
   to introduce legislation that would ban the assignment of popular
   government agency names to anyone," he told The Netly News after
   speaking at an Internet child safety seminar this afternoon. "Can you
   imagine how many people have thought they were contacting the White
   House only to see that?" A better question might be which site is the
   more popular one. --By Declan McCullagh/Washington

Might Makes Right

       Congress rarely does the right thing for the right reason.Instead,
   lobbyists vie to make voting the wrong way too politically costly for
   legislators.

       Now a new coalition, called Americans for Computer Privacy, is
   trying out this strategy on encryption legislation. The group of high
   tech firms and nonprofit groups aims to convince lawmakers that
   supporting restrictions on either the domestic use or overseas
   shipment of encryption productions is too politically painful.

       "We would not turn the keys to our front doors over the
   government. Why should we have to turn over the keys to our
   computers?" asked ACP counsel and former White House lawyer Jack
   Quinn.

         To convince Americans that ACP's answer is the right one, the
   coalition has gathered together an advisory panel of former spooks and
   law enforcement agents.

       Quinn told the Netly News that his strategy has already won
   results--"Senior officials at the National Security Council and the
   vice president's office" this morning signaled they're willing to sit
   down at the table for a friendly chat about crypto-laws. --By Declan

                   Seeking an Effective Democratic
                      Response to Globalization
                        and Corporate Power

           an international workshop for activist leaders

           Summer 1998, Canada -- details available soon

         Organized by: Citizens for a Democratic Renaissance
       ~-===================================================-~


WHO WE ARE...
We are an informal association of concerned citizens from around the
world who are dedicated to overcoming corporate domination through the
revitalization of constitutional democracy.

OUR MISSION...
is to work with people and organizations everywhere to help
bring about an historic transition from this "Era of Corporate Hegemony"
to a new "Era of Democratic Renaissance".

WHY WE ARE SPONSORING THIS WORKSHOP...
The purpose of the workshop is to begin a global consensus-building
process among diverse activist groups -- to develop a shared perspective
on globalization and a common strategy for effective democratic counter-
measures. This process will be continued in larger follow-on conferences
and in other ways, aiming toward the the creation of a potent political
movement...

         The Global Coalition for a Democratic Renaissance


    ~-===============================================================-~
                              Manifesto for a
                          Democratic Renaissance

      (1) Corporate globalization is leading the world to disaster and
      something MUST be done about it. Corporate influence has corrupted
      our democracies, undermined our sovereignties, bankrupted our govern-
      ments and is destroying the very earth our survival depends upon.

      (2) The very success of corporate globalism in subjugating everyone
      to its agenda has created the potential for a massive counter-movement,
      a peaceful democratic counter-revolution on a global scale.

      (3) Political activists must rise to the challenge of this strategic
      opportunity -- it is time to move beyond our special-interest
      causes and find a path to solidarity and the collaborative pursuit
      of shared objectives. Foremost among our tasks is to build bridges
      across the gulfs dividing factions such as liberals & conservatives,
      believers & non-believers, labor & environmentalists, etc.

                     We are all in this together!

      (4) Overcoming corporate globalism calls for more than protest or
      resistance -- it requires a different vision for the world, a
      coherent agenda which can provide sustainable prosperity and
      which avoids chaos during the historic transition.

      (5) That vision and agenda must be based on the establishment of
      healthy democratic processes in our individual nations and on
      the realization that sustainable economics and respect for the
      environment are not just good ideas, but are rather necessities
      for human survival.
    ~-===============================================================-~

About the workshop..

This initial workshop will be very small, limited to approximately
fifty invited delegates. We are seeking a "representative sample"
of activist leaders from every corner of the world, representing
diverse constituencies and all walks of life. This workshop will be
held in English, but we are developing the capability to support
multiple languages in future events.

The reason for the small size is to ensure that everyone will be heard
and to encourage an atmosphere of comradarie and focused endeavor.
Workshop deliberations will be based on the principle of consensus,
ensuring that no one is coerced and that no viewpoints are ignored.

The workshop will be one week in duration. Meals and accommodations
will be provided on-site and local volunteers will enable us to keep
workshop fees to a minimum. Staff and other locals, including indigenous
tribal members, will join us for evening activities, which will emphasize
sharing of cultural traditions through conversation, music, dance, and
story telling.

A web page on our server will be dedicated to the workshop, and daily
bulletins will be published, including session reports and delegate
interviews. An email list will be dedicated to discussion of the
workshop, and netizens everywhere are invited to participate remotely
via these facilities.

A professional and unobtrusive film crew will be in attendance to record
selected workshop activities and to interview delegates and others.
A broadcast-quality documentary will be produced to promote the coalition
and will be made available at a nominal fee for non-commercial use. We
will also seek broadcast, cable, and video distribution worldwide.

The workshop process will begin before the workshop actually convenes.
As delegates are recruited, email and fax will be used to introduce
delegates to one another and to begin substantive discussions.
Session details will be settled in this way and a draft manifesto
will be developed on a collaborative basis.

Sessions will generally begin with a panel presentation and then open
up to general discussion. We will break up into smaller groups fre-
quently to enable all delegates to contribute and to facilitate the
consensus process. Session descriptions may change depending on
delegate interest and willingness to participate on panels.
