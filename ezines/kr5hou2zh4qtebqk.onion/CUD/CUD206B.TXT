Regarding "what to do when you talk to LE agents":

Most of these guidelines are important when talking to reporters, too.  One
would expect the press to be the underground's natural allies: the First
Amendment should always be  near  and  dear  to their  hearts. In practice,
however, they have often taken action that seems designed to encourage
authorities to curb free speech.  Also,  one of the recurring themes in
articles posted by victimes of witchhunts is the effect of unfavorable
publicity on  people's lives.  There  was  such  an account in this very
issue! So watch your tongue. Remember, if the press  believe  you're  a
bad  guy they'll   say  anything  to  get  you  to  make  a  "publishable"
statement.

Law Enforcement and Computers:

Not many law enforcement officials KNOW about computers. They see a computer
as a way to check on a license plate or NCIC (we all know what that is)

Refusing to answer questions gets on the bad side of a law enforcement
officer, and sometimes he/she WILL use force against you (Indianapolis
is a prime example of violent force against criminals)

Saying "I want my lawyer" will do nothing but enrage your typical cop/agent
and there is the possiblity that they would say "F*** your lawyer, I want
answers NOW!!!" then proceed to beat the holy snot out of you...

To the police, a criminal is a criminal...no matter is you're a murderer, a
rapist, a thief or even a hacker.

Of course you *could* bring brutality charges... so then the agent/cop lies
and gets out of it ... big deal. Like the alleged thief described in
C-u-D 2.05, you might be innocent but their being there makes you guilty.

Enough Said...

Comment on Operation Sun Devil

One of the reasons SS agents confiscated various BBS systems was because of
the so called "ILLEGAL" information contained on them.  It doesn't matter
that most if not all of the "ILLEGAL" information can be found in a local
Library, the SS still claimed it should not be posted on Electronic
Bulletin Boards.

Well the other day as I was thumbing through the latest issue of Computer
Shopper I stumbled across an ad for, Guess what??? "TOP SECRET MANUALS"
among them being:  Computer Phreaking, Beyond Van Eck Phreaking, Automatic
Teller Machines, Phone Color Boxes, Voice Mail Hacking, etc, etc.

I suppose this is ok because it is in printed form.  Same information but
different form, is there a difference?  Not to me!!!
