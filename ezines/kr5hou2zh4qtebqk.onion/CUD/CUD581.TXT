Subject: File 1--Another BBS/Bombing Connection (Ill.)

Another incident of an alleged BBS/bombing connection has occurred,
this time in Cook County (Illinois).  WILLIAM PRESECKY, "6 Youth's
Hobby was Bombs, Police Say," (Chicago Tribute, 8 October, 1993:
Section 2,pp1, 4) summarizes six 15 and 16 year-old highschool
students' escapades in blowing up over 70 mailboxes in Lyons Township,
Ill., in Cook County near Chicago.  The story begins:

     Armed with potentially deadly materials and some
     computer-generated know-how, six west suburban teenagers
     allegedly formed the nucleus of a bomb-making club broken up
     by authorities this week.

                                      ....

     At least two of the suspected teens could be charged as
     adults, pending a review of the juvenile petitions next week
     by the Cook County state's attorney's office, authorities
     said.

                                      ....

     "These are A and  students, honor roll students.  They come
     from well-to-do families," but appear to have no other
     activities to keep themselves busy, according to ((a police
     spokesperson)).

     As many as  10 more teenagers from the same area are
     suspected of being involved in the manufacture and
     detonation of assorted homemade bombs that police said may
     have damaged or destroyed as many as 70 mailboxes in the
     west and southwest suburbs over the past several months,
     according to ((a police spokesperson)).

                                      ....

     A search of two of the teens' homes yielded a large cache of
     bomb-making material, including pipes, chemicals, black
     powder and detonating devices as well as eight to 10
     partially made bombs.  Also found were several ready-to-use
     bombs that were rendered harmless by members of the Cook
     County Bomb Squad and sent for analysis to the federal ATF's
     laboratory in Maryland.

     Also confiscated from one of the homes were three computer
     didks containing recorded information that, despite its
     disclaimers, ((the police spokesperson)) said could be used
     to create an assortment of mayhem, with titles such as "22
     Ways to Kill a Human Being With your Bare Hands." The disks
     contained information  on advanced bomb-making technology,
     including the use of remote-control and time delay
     detonation, ((the spokesperson)said.

     Whether the teens accused of making and using the bombs
     actually used the computer-generated information to
     manfacture the devices isn't certain.

                                      ....

     "It's a frightening thing that kids have this kind ov
     access, that anyone with access to this kind of material
     would be this irresponsible," said Burr Ridge Police Chief
     Herbert Timm.

Chicago's Channel 2 tv, a CBS affiliate, also covered the story on
it's evening news. "The SHOCKING part of it is where they learned" the
information, intoned the story (original emphasis).  In a substantial
(by news standards) segment, Channel 2 reporters interviewed what
appeared to be a computer store owner who claimed that most BBS sysops
are "kids from 8 to 14" and that there are even a few adults who run
BBSes. The reporters informed the audience that most "hackers" are
under 14, and that there are "thousands of BBSes in the Chicago area
and elsewhere." Although the intent to inform parents of their
responsibility in monitoring juveniles and instilling a social ethic
is laudable, the factual errors and superficial hyperbole are not.

             COMPUTER PORN CASE TRIGGERS LEGAL QUESTIONS
                     By David Zizzo, Staff Writer

Is talking to Anthony Davis hazardous to your health?

In a manner of speaking, that's what numerous people with computers and
modems apparently have been worrying about since late July.  That's
when Oklahoma City police raided Davis' software publishing firm and
confiscated his sophisticated commercial computer bulletin board
system.  Authorities allege Davis was selling pornographic computerized
materials on CD-ROM and through files downloaded over phone lines.

Names of everyone who signed onto Davis' bulletin board service, those
who downloaded or uploaded graphic files depicting sexual acts and
those who didn't are in the hands of investigators.

                                .....

The Davis bust sent a chill throughout the national computer community,
said Jack Rickard, editor and publisher of Boardwatch magazine, a
bulletin board newsletter published in Littleton, Colo.  "It's causing
chaos," he said.  Rickard said Oklahoma City is being viewed "a little
bit like clown city" in computer circles, since the explicit material
Davis offered can be purchased in nearly every computer magazine and is
carried by numerous bulletin boards.  "This is off the shelf," he said.
"It's considered pretty mundane stuff."

                                .....

The bust will test Oklahoma laws on "community standards" regarding
pornography, said Mike Godwin, attorney for the Electronic Frontier
Foundation.  The Washington, D.C., advocacy group is funded by donors
that include large software companies.  "When you talk about community
standards, who's the real community?" Godwin wonders.  "Is it the city
or ... the community of people on-line?"

Holmes, a former Cleveland County prosecutor, calls Oklahoma's
pornography law "an extremely broad statute." "I'm not sure it wouldn't
include Playboy or Penthouse type publications," he said.

                                .....

Critics also say police over reached in grabbing Davis' entire system,
shutting down his pay-for-play computer service, because of four CDs.
Prosecutors are seeking forfeiture of the system, which includes a 13
gigabyte memory unit and 10 high speed modems.  "They don't have to
seize it any more than they have to seize the building when they
confiscate a bookstore," said Godwin of the Electronic Frontier
Foundation.

>From Boardwatch Magazine / September, 1993. Under the byline of
Lance Rose:"BBS BURNINGS" in the Legally Online column, p. 62
================================================

 OKLAHOMA BBS RAIDED ON PORNOGRAPHY CHARGES

The legal assault on bulletin boards continues this month with a raid
by Oklahoma City Police Department Vice Division on Tony Davis's
OKLAHOMA INFORMATION EXCHANGE BBS and his associated Mid-America
Digital Publishing Company.

About 4:00 PM on July 20, four officers of the Oklahoma City Police
Department arrived at the offices of Mid-America Digital Publishing
with a search warrant for "pornographic CD-ROMs."   Davis was arrested
on suspicion of the sale and distribution of pornographic CD-ROM
disks.  Of the 2000 CD ROM disks available on site, they confiscated
about 50 disks, and an estimated $75,000 worth of equipment Davis runs
his 10-line OKLAHOMA INFORMATION EXCHANGE BBS on.  The equipment
including two computers with gigabyte hard drives, two Pioneer 6-disk
drives, four single CD ROM drives, 10 High Speed Hayes modems, Novell
network software and associated hardware, etc.

Apparently, an undercover agent had contacted Mid-America Digital
Publishing on two occasions and purchased CD-ROM disks containing
adult material from the company.  At the raid, Davis cooperated with
the police showing them whatever they wanted to see, and even removing
four disks from CD-ROMS on the BBS machine and showing them to the
police.  Curiously, these were standard off-the-shelf CD ROM
collections NOT published by Davis, including "Busty Babes", "For
Adults Only #2," "For Adults Only #3", and "Storm II".  More
curiously, the police themselves put the disks BACK into the BBS in
order to video tape callers accessing the files on the disks.

                                ......

Despite Davis' notification, none of the specific procedures required
by federal law (Privacy Protection Act) when serving search warrants
on publishers was followed, and no acknowledgement or even apparent
cognizance of the Electronic Communications Privacy Act made when
notified of the electronic mail for some 2000 BBS users available on
the system.  OKLAHOMA INFORMATION EXCHANGE carries some 750 FidoNet
conferences, an additional 750 Usenet Newsgroups, and offers callers
private FidoNet mail and Internet mail and actually hubs mail for
other bulletin board systems as well.

                                ......

All possible charges relate to Oklahoma State statutes against
obscenity.  Located in the heart of the Bible Belt, this could be
serious. A penalty of up to $5000 and 5 years in prison per infraction
is possible.  If you count each file on a CD-ROM as an infraction, Mr.
Davis could in theory be facing over a 100,000 years in jail and
nearly a $100 million in fines - another contrast between
technological reality and our legal system. From what we understand,
in Oklahoma, it is technically illegal to actually BE naked at any
time when not actually getting wet somehow, and some legal theorists
posit that HBO and Showtime cable television channels are actually
infractions under the state laws as written.

Subject: File 3--A Few Biblio Items (Paulsen, Encryption, & P. Zimmerman)

--JULIAN DIBBELL'S "Code Warriors: Battling for the Keys to Privacy in
the Info Age," (The Village Voice, 28 July, 1993: pp 33-37) summarizes
the debates in encryption and privacy. It includes snippets from John
Gilmore, Tim May, and Eric Hughes, and cleanly and concisely explains
in simple (but not simplistic) lay terms the nature of the debates
underlying Clipper, Moby Crypto, and other issues in the encryption
wars.

--ERIC DEXHEIMER, in Denver Westord (Vol.17, #6, 29 Sept '93), "Secrets
gend: The Government wants to Breakhim,but Boulder's Prince of Privacy
remains Cryptic" summarizes the issues in the Phil Zimmerman/PGP
encryption controversy. The story inludes an indepth analysis and a
strong profile of Zimmerman (in CuD archives).

--JONATHAN LITTMAN, "The Last Hacker," in Los Angeles Times Magazine (p
18), 12 September, '93, focuses on Kevin Poulsen and his recent legal
problems.
While not unsympathetic to Paulsen, the story concludes:

       Born in a time when hacking was an innocent rite of
    boyhood, when laws were as unclear as the boundaries of the
    Arpanet,  Kevin Poulsen had outlived his era.

HoHoCon is the largest annual gathering of those in, related to, or
wishing to know more about the computer underground. Attendees
generally include some of the most notable members of the "hacking"
and "telecom" community, journalists, authors, security professionals,
lawyers, and a host of others. Previous speakers include John Draper
(Cap'n Crunch), Ray Kaplan, Chris Goggans (Erik Bloodaxe), Bruce
Sterling, and many more. The conference is also one of the very few
that is completely open to the public and we encourage anyone who is
interested to attend.


                            Hotel Information -----------------

The Austin North Hilton recently split its complex into two separate

                            Conference Details
                            __________________

HoHoCon will last 3 days, with the actual conference being held on
Saturday, December 18 starting at 11:00 a.m. and continuing until 5 p.m.
or earlier depending on the number of speakers. Although a few speakers
have confirmed their attendance, we are still in the planning stages and
will wait until the next update to release a speaking schedule. We welcome
any speaker or topic recommendations you might have (except for, say, "Why
I Luv Baked Potatoes On A Stik!"), or, if you would like to speak yourself,
please contact us as soon as possible and let us know who you are, who you
represent (if anyone), the topic you wish to speak on, a rough estimate of
how long you will need, and whether or not you will be needing any
audio-visual aids.

We would like to have people bring interesting items and videos again this
year. If you have anything you think people would enjoy having the chance
to see, please let us know ahead of time, and tell us if you will need any
help getting it to the conference. If all else fails, just bring it to the
con and give it to us when you arrive. Any organization or individual that
wants to bring flyers to distribute during the conference may do so. You
may also send your flyers to us ahead of time if you can not make it to
the conference and we will distribute them for you. Left over flyers are
included with information packets and orders that we send out, so if you
want to send extras, go ahead.


                                   Cost
                                   ----

Unlike smaller, less informative conferences, we do not ask you to shell
out hundreds of dollars just to get in the door, nor do we take your money
and then make you sleep in a tent. We are maintaining the motto of "give
$5 if you can", but due to the incredibly high conference room rate this
year, we may step up to "$5 minimum required donation" or "give us $5 or
we'll smash your head in". Five dollars is an outrageously low price
compared to the suit infested industry conferences or even the new "Cons
are k00l and trendy, I gotta do one too!" conferences that are charging
up to $50 for admission alone.

To encourage people to donate, we will once again be having our wonderless
"Raffle For The Elite" during the conference. We will issue a prize list
in a future update, but we can guarantee that this year there will be a
lot more (and better) prizes than last year, including a full system (and,
no, it's not a c64 or 286). Anyone who wishes to donate worthwhile items
to the raffle, please let us know ahead of time, or if it's a last minute
acquirement, just bring it to the conference.


                           Miscellaneous Notes
                           -------------------

To save myself some time by mailing responses to a lot of the same
questions I expect to get, I'll answer a few of them here.

Although I have not talked to him myself yet, Steve Ryan has told me that
Bruce Sterling will indeed be in attendance and may say a few words.

As far as I know, there will not be any visitors from any other planets
at the conference. Scot Chasin is still on Earth and will be making an
appearance.

Video cameras will *not* be allowed inside the conference room without
prior consent due to previous agreements made with speakers who do not
wish for certain parts of their speech to be rebroadcast. Still cameras
and Etch-A-Sketch's are fine and tape recorders are too easily hidden
for us to be able to control.

Videos and T-Shirts from last year's conference are still available, and
will also be on hand during the conference. We do not handle the LoD World
Tour shirts, but I can tell you that that the old ones are gone and a
*new* LoD shirt will be unveiled at the conference. The HoHoCon shirts are
$15 plus $3 shipping ($4.00 for two shirts). At this time, they only come
in extra large. We may add additional sizes if there is a demand for them.
The front of the shirt has the following in a white strip across the
chest:

                               I LOVE FEDS

      (Where LOVE = a red heart, very similar to the I LOVE NY logo)


                          And this on the back:

                            dFx & cDc Present

                               HOHOCON '92

                              December 18-20
                              Allen Park Inn
                              Houston, Texas


   There is another version of the shirt available with the following:

HoHoCon information available in /pub/hohocon. The .gifs from previous
cons are *not* currently online.

Conference information and updates will most likely also be found in most
computer underground related publications and mailing lists, including
CuD, CSP, Mondo 2000, 2600, Phrack, TUC, phn0rd, cypherpunks, etc. They
should also appear in a number of newsgroups including comp.dcom.telecom,
alt.security, comp.org.eff.talk, and sci.crypt. We completely encourage
people to use, reprint, and distribute any information in this file.


     Same stupid ending statement from last year to make us look good
     ----------------------------------------------------------------

HoHoCon '93 will be a priceless learning experience for professionals
and gives journalists a chance to gather information and ideas direct
from the source. It is also one of the very few times when all the
members of the computer underground can come together for a realistic
purpose. We urge people not to miss out on an event of this caliber,
which doesn't happen very often. If you've ever wanted to meet some of
the most famous people from the hacking community, this may be your
one and only chance. Don't wait to read about it in all the magazines
and then wish you had been there, make your plans to attend now! Be a
part of what we hope to be our largest and greatest conference ever.

Subject: File 5--"Hacker" Documentary Proposed

((MODERATORS' NOTE: Annaliza Orquamada, a film-school graduate from
London, intends to challenge conventional media myths about "hackers"
in a proposed documentary. Below, we print a summary of her project.
We will post a substantial version in about a week.  From our
conversations and e-mail interaction with her, we find her a highly
informed and competent observer and a refreshing change from most
conventional media folk)).


                       UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS ONLY

Computers are becoming an integral part of our everyday existence.
They are used to store a multitude of information, from credit reports
and bank withdrawals to personal letters and highly sensitive military
documents.  So how secure are our computer systems?

The computer hacker is an expert at infiltrating secured systems, such
as those at AT&T, TRW, NASA and the DMV.  Most computer systems that
have a telephone connection have been under siege at one time or
another, many without their owner's knowledge.  The really good
hackers can re-route the telephone system, obtain highly sensitive
coporate and government documents, download individuals credit
reports, make free phone calls globally, read private electronic mail
and corporate bulletins and get away without ever leaving a trace.

So who are these hackers?  Just exactly WHAT do they DO, and WHY do
they do it?  Are they really a threat?  What do they do with the
information they obtain?  Are hackers simply playing an intellectual
game of chess or are hackers using technology to effectively take
control of corporate and government systems that have previously
appeared omnipotent?

Our group is in the course of filming "Unauthorized Access", a
documentary that will demystify the hype and propaganda surrounding
the computer hacker.

We will expose the truths of this sub-culture focusing on the hackers
themselves.  This will be a view from inside the global underground.
We intend to shoot in the United States, Holland and Germany.

This documentary will be of the highest broadcast quality and is
intended for international television, festival and theatrical
distribution.

We are currently looking for additional financial backers interested
in this project. For more information about "Unauthorized Access" or
if you are intrested in providing any information or support, please
contact annaliza@netcom.com.

Extortion at AT&T
=================
Two men, one a former computer support services employee at AT&T, have
pleaded guilty to conspiring to extort one million dollars from the
company.  The US Attorney in Newark, NJ reports that Lou Pacich and
Richard Vignevic sent AT&T a tape-recorded message claiming sensitive
information about commercial accounts was being leaked to competitors.
The two offered to plug the leak in exchange for the money. To bolster
the claim they sent copies of account information on 4,000 AT&T
commercial customers. The information has been obtained, w/out
authorization, from AT&T computer systems. Each man faces 20 years and
$250,000 in fines.
(Information Week. Sept 20, 1993 pg8)

Piracy Around the Globe
=======================
The Oct 1993 issue of Technology Training reports on software piracy
in various countries. In Cuba, there is a National Software
Interchange Center where all types of software is available to any
Cuban at no charge.  The estimated piracy rate in China and South
Korea is about 90%.  Italy checks in at 80%.
(Information Week. Sept 20, 1993 pg62)

How do I love thee...
=====================
In "Hard Drives" (Los Angeles Times Magazine, Sept 12, 1993 pg26)
author James Fallows says that we value computers for the ways they
increase our efficiency and productivity. But we love them for the way
they undermine productivity (games, BBSing, etc) and satisfy our
craving for new possessions. Computers play on one of our basic needs,
the compulsion to figure something out and make it work.
(Information Week. Sept 20, 1993 pg62)

IW Security Survey Results
==========================
Information Week magazine and Ernst and Young conducted an extensive
security survey and found, to their surprise, that a _minority_ of
organizations polled considered security to be an important issue.
They also found that one in four companies had last money over last
two years due to security breaches in their networks. Most
organizations don't even have full time security staffs.  CuD
encourages you to refer to "Tempting Fate", pgs42-52, October 4, 1993
for complete details.

P&G Consultant Indicted
=======================
A Procter & Gamble consultant, Matthew Daughtery, has been charged
with three felony counts for using P&G computers to access a company
bulletin board without authorization.  The BBS is identified as
"Regulatory and Clinical Development Network".  Ohio prosecutors have
not said what information Daughtery could have obtained from the
system.
(Information Week. pg8. Oct 4, 1993)

Consumer Privacy Survey ======================= A Harris poll,
sponsored by the non-profit Center for Social and Legal Research
(Washington, DC), found that 53% OF American adults are very concerned
about threats to their privacy from corporations. This is a
substantial increase over results in previous years.  Respondents were
most concerned about financial services and health industries (72%),
with mail-order consumer goods businesses rating 48%. For complete
results refer to the Privacy & American Business newsletter. For more
summary information refer to Information Week, pg58, Oct 4, 1993.

Internet Access in NJ
=====================
New Jersey Bell and Bellcore are sponsoring a two-year experiment to
allow people free access to the Internet in three dozen public
libraries in the Garden State. Anyone with a modem can also tap into
portions of the Internet from home by calling the project's dial-up at
(201) 989-5999. Plans are in the works to have fiber-optic cable
installed in every home and business throughout NJ by 2010. Officials
will monitor this experiment to see how pedestrians interact with the
worldwide network and hope the project will become a model for the
nation.
(Communications of the ACM, pg11, Oct 1993. Reprinted with permission)

Sex and Violence Nipper Chip
============================
For as little as $5 parents may soon be able to implement a computer
chip in televisions to monitor programs their children watch. With the
growing concern over TV sex and violence comes the debate whether
"lock out" technologies are the solution. Under pressure from
Congress, networks and stations may eventually be forced to rate shows
-- "V" for violence, "N" for nudity, for instance -- and broadcast a
code along with the show which could then be read by the "V-chip"
installed in the set or cable box. The same technology is already used
for broadcasting closed captioned information for the hearing impaired
and will be used to transmit and display information such as the title
and time remaining of shows in progress.  Broadcasters and program
producers are no fans of this idea, arguing the technology will take
away viewers and frighten advertisers.  (Communications of the ACM,
pg12, Oct 1993. Reprinted with permission)

Nightline on Security/Privacy?
==============================
According to James Daly ("Security Watch") the folks at NBC's
Nightline have been talking to folks in the computer security industry
over the past few weeks. A show on security/privacy can't be far
behind. Keep an eye out for it.

Wrongo - This application was made by ASP, my company (then) in
Pittsburgh, PA and with no government contracts whatsoever.  This is a
typical assumptive response from someone who doesn't understand that
poor people like me get access to computers by the grace of others.
Perhaps you think I was previously a professor at Duquesne University,
and before that an employee of the NSA, and before that an employee of
wherever my previous mail account came from.  This kind of response
from someone who appears from his mailing address to be from a person
at a major university who is almost certainly getting government
grants is certainly the pot calling the kettle black.

Interesting question, and one that I have asked, but then why should I
need any permission from the government for anything?  Perhaps I
shouldn't, but the fact is, they have the power, and if you work
within the structure, you may find that it is not as oppressive as you
thought.

The point is that even ASP, a tiny company with no government ties got
permission by simply following the rules.  Should IBM be treated
unfairly?

Try reading more closely.  The EFF is defending those who may have
broken the law.  Sorry if I mixed my pronouns, I am a human being.

The government certainly has the right to require it, but perhaps it
won't have that right as a result of the PGP case.  The issue is that
if they didn't want to go to federal court, why were they trying to
play it so close to the edge?  If I walk up to you and swing a
baseball bat within a few inches of your head, are you going to ignore
me because I didn't hit you?

Where does the constitution say this?  I agree that I would prefer it that
way, but I don't think there is any basis in law for your statement.
