New FTP Site
+++++++++++

 A second FTP archive has been set up at the University of Chicago, to help
distribute the load. It'll be an exact shadow of the
ftp.cs.widener.edu site. The info you'll need is:

   ftp to chsun1.uchicago.edu [128.135.12.60]
   login as anonymous
   send your email address as the password
   the stuff's in pub/cud

The Mail-server is also up and runing.  People need to send mail to:
archive-server@chsun1.uchicago.edu with the word "help" on a line by itself
in the body of the letter.  This will send them the help file for the email
server.  Also, adding the word "index" on a line by itself will send the
general Index for all files on the email server (includes other things
besides the CuD archives).  Basically, the sections are broken down to the
various directories contained in ^^/pub/cud on the ftp archives.  So if
someone wanted to get specific index by a section, they would put the
phrase:

index cud

on a line by itself and get the cud index file.  Since there are quite a
few large files contained in the archives, the arc-master will have to
personally make special requests to split the files up and make them
available to whoever asks (the email and ftp servers are linked together to
save space).  This puts more delay for email requesters but it's probably
the best way to go for the time being.

Resource Corrections

The cost of TAP has increased a bit. They are now $2 for single issues or
$10 for ten.

NIA's correct address is:  elisem@nuchat.sccsi.com

Len Rose Update
+++++++++++++

Len Rose's trial in Baltimore remains scheduled for January 28 in the
Federal District Court before judge J. Frederick Motz.  Len's public
defender has been replaced with Jane Macht, described by those who know her
as highly competent and responsive.  Len faces a five-count indictment
alleging "crimes" under 18 USC s1030(a)(6), 18 USC s2314, and 18 USC s2,
which, as written, charge him with interstate transportation of AT&T source
code and with transfering a "trojan horse login program." The indictment
also links Len to the Legion of Doom, which it describes in a highly
prejudicial narrative. Previous issues of CuD have provided in-depth
details of the case, including a copy of the indictment.  A large (1650
line) file with complete background is available from the CuD ftp sites.
