Subject: ATI and bounced mail
Date: Oct 15 '90

Ati #51 has been sent out, and anyone who hasn't received it yet should
email me again with an alternate address.  About 10 addresses bounced back
when I tried to mail ATI to them.

Alt.society.ati has been created and people can read ATI that way instead
of having it mailed to them.
ATI's editors can be reached at:  groundzero@TRONSBOX.XEI.COM

   I was surprised at the voluminous amounts of mail we received because of
the article I submitted to CuD (#2.07, file 7) recently...  However, I was
even more surprised at the number of people asking about subscriptions and
what have you to the publication "Toxic Shock."

               "What we have here is a failure to communicate."

   Toxic Shock is a group, *NOT* a publication.
   We write text files in which we give our views/opinions, and sometimes
      just have fun.
   We occasionally send out a newsletter entitled The Flaming Fetus, which
      is essentially an electronic newsletter.  It is put out on a *VERY*
      irregular schedule right now...
   We DO want new members/writers, and we DO try to educate, inform, and
      piss off, but we do this through our text files and the occasional
      newsletter.  We do not have the finances available to make an actual
      magazine for our views (but would gladly do so if the finances were
      available to us, hint hint), and our views are probably not the kind
      that the government would allow to be printed for very long.

   I hope this clears up the misunderstanding...It was an easy mistake...

Several authors argue that the major financial impact of computer crime
comes from inside jobs.  In the March 1990 Communications of the ACM, the
president's letter has the following example:

Take for example the case of Harold Smith and Sammie Marshall.  Between
1976 and 1981, they embezzled $21.3 million from Wells Fargo Bank.  The
fraud was nothing but standard old check kiting.  Check kiting is cashing a
check on an account whose only deposit is a check that has not cleared yet
and then covering the draft on the other account with another rubber check
from the first bank, which is covered by a rubber check from the second
bank, etc. etc.  This can go on indefinitely.  It is a game that anyone can
play.  A major national brokerage house was recently fined by the federal
government for doing the same thing on a massive scale.  Smith and Marshall
played the game from inside the bank.  Instead of using ordinary checks,
they used the bank's branch settlement system to keep a steadily growing
mountain of fraud in circulation within the branch settlement system.

You'd have to make a lot of free phone calls to match that.
