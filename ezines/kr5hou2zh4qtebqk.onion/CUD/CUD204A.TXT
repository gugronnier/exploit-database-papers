CuD Survey About Ready
++++++++++++++++++

Bob Krause has the survey of CuD readers about ready to send.  The earlier
announcement of the survey received positive responses, so he will send it
out directly from his site.  The purpose is to find out who the readership
is. The subscribers are overwhelmingly professional (computer scientists,
journalists, academics), with the rest divided up among students, law
enforcement or computer security, and the generally curious.  The results
will remain in-house, although Bob intends to use some of the data for a
conference paper.

CuD Format
+++++++++++++++++++

We have tried to format CuD in response to the various suggestions that
have come to us since we began. Since we moved to the current "standard"
format, we have received few suggestions and no complaints. Sometimes a
reality check is wise, so if you have suggestions, let us know. We
currently format at 75 characters per line, but reader who print it out
before reading may prefer 65 characters, our own preference. We are
wondering if there is any strong feeling on the format, one way or the
other.

++++++++++++++++++++++++
LEN ROSE UPDATE
++++++++++++++++++++++++

Len Rose's trial is still scheduled for February. His situation, however,
continues to cause problems. Although even by the least charitable
assessment his crimes are not serious, the publicity and that "taint" makes
it difficult for him to find employment, and he has no steady source of
income whatsoever.  His problems are complicated by the seizure of his
possessions.  He lost his equipment, and even if ultimately exonerated as
Craig Neidorf was, the financial burden makes it impossible to support his
wife and children.  Strong arguments have been made in the past for hiring
people with competent computer skills, especially those who possess
expertise in the realm of computer security. Len has demonstrated his
competence in the past as a programmer and as a consultant, and his skills
would be an asset to any employer.  CuD is not an employment bulletin, but
there are times when those seeking employment should have an alternative
forum to engage in their search, and we are willing to provide space on
occasion to put potential employers in contact with candidates.
