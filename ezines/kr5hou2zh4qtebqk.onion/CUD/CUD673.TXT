          communication.
            `(c) Emergency or Exigent Circumstances  . - In emergency or

          (a)(3) by allowing monitoring at its premises if that is the only
          means of accomplishing the interception or access.
            `(d) Mobile Service Assistance Requirements  . - A
          telecommunications carrier offering a feature or service that

          access to the content of such communications or call-identifying
          information within the service area in which interception has been
          occurring as a result of the subscriber`s use of such a feature or
          service, information is available to the government (before,
          during, or immediately after the transfer of such communications)
          identifying the provider of wire or electronic communication
          service that has acquired access to the communications.

From: Jerry Leichter <leichter@LRW.COM>
Subject: File 2--The Good, the Bad, the Ugly, and the Confused (Re: CuD 6.72)
X-Vms-Mail-To: CUD

A couple of CuD issues back I took Wade Riddick to task for calling on the
government to get involved in computer technology by drafting
standards for computers.  In the interest of sniping at both extremes,
I feel compelled to reply to Brock Meeks.  Unlike Mr. Riddick, who
proposed things that probably offended much of the on-line community,
Mr. Meeks, in his outraged condemnation of the current version of the
FBI "wiretap access" bill (and really the principles that would apply
to any version thereof) probably speaks words near and dear to the
hearts of most of his readers.  I believe he, and those readers, are
being every bit as naive as I accused Mr. Riddick of being.

Mr. Riddick believes the direction of technology is influenced by the
market, and that society, through the government, has a right to exert
its own influence.  Mr. Meeks seems to believe that technology will go
where it wishes - perhaps modulated by the market, perhaps not - and
society/government should have no say in the matter.  He seems to
believe that the telephone industry is being uniquely cursed with
government regulation of the direction it can let technology take it.
"Never again, under the provisions of this bill, will a
telecommunications provider be able to develop a service or technology
without first and foremost asking the question:  How can I design this
so that it pops off the assembly line wiretap ready?"  There will be
actual government penalties for non-compliance.

The automobile manufacturers, of course, have never been subject to
such regulation.  No, they can make brakelights any color they like.
They need not worry about what goes out the tailpipes of their
automobiles - they can simply use the cheapest, best technologies for
engines.  They needn't waste money and weight on silly things like
seat belts and air bags and energy-absorbing bumpers and collapsing
steering wheels that don't crush the driver.  If the market wants
those things, let the market worry about it.  If the market likes
high-powered engines, let the manufacturers go ahead and build them -
who cares how much gas they use?

Of course, while the auto makers are building those high-technology
cars, they need not be constrained by any worries about the chemicals
that happen to go up their smokestacks or out their sewers or get
buried in their waste dumps.  Any such worries would constrain their
techological choices.

Oh, and when the designers work on aerodynamics, they needn't feel
constrained to leave space for a flat 6 by 12 inch (or a different
size, elsewhere than the US) plate on the front, right in the air
stream.  No, and purchasers needn't pay their governments significant
amounts of money on a regular basis so that they can display that
piece of ugly steel - which, by the way, seriously invades their
privacy; anyone remember the scandals of the 60's when police
photographed the license plates of cars parked near anti-war
demonstrations?

Oh, yes, TV makers were never forced to include the ridiculous UHF
tuners for stations no one wanted to watch anyway, or radio makers
that silly FM band - they could just use the best, cheapest
technology, good old VHF and AM.  For that matter, TV broadcasters
could choose any color encoding system they liked - "the best
technology" was more important than all those silly old black and
white TV's.  Likewise, the FM broadcasters could choose any stereo
encoding system.

Let's look further.  Supermarkets can save money by scanning UPC
labels - they needn't label each individual item with its price.  Gun
makers are under no obligation to include serial numbers on their
weapons.  (For that matter, neither are auto manufacturers.)  Makers
of children's clothing needn't worry about how flammable it is - just
use the latest man-made fibers!  Builders can use any materials they
wish, and make buildings as tall as they like, anywhere they like.
You want a nuclear reactor in your basement so you can be free of the
power grid?  Go ahead!  Plutonium is available at your local hardware
store.

Hey, any other approach *interferes with the technology*!  It makes
the world *less efficient*!

Let's get real.  There are social goods beyond the "latest and
greatest" technology.  There are social goods beyond "the most
efficient" solution.  If you don't believe that, perhaps you're in
favor of getting rid of all those labor laws - it would be so much
more *efficient* to go back to 6-day weeks of 10-hour days.  And, of
course, we should get rid of those silly child-labor laws - kids
aren't learning anything in school anyway, why not let them earn a few
cents an hour, all the while making US manufacturing more competitive
with the third world?  While we're at it, look at the money we waste
on all those people sitting in prison - prison labor is cheap and
plentiful.  An untapped resource if ever there was one!

You want to drive on the public highways?  You *will* register your
car, pay the appropriate fees, and mount a license plate.  You want to
open a shop and sell to the public?  You *will* collect sales taxes,
and by the way keep records of sales - whether that slows down your
business or not - and make them available to the tax authorities on
appropriate demand, whether you think that invades your privacy or
not.  Oh, yes, and you will make those records available in a form
convenient to the tax authorities - probably paper, perhaps 1/2 inch
magnetic tape in some long-obsolete format - whether you find that
consistent with your vision of the correct technology for running a
business or not.

We are all members of a society, and we all make use of the social
goods it provides to us.  How long would the telephone companies last
with no legal system to enforce its contracts?  (I suppose some of the
radical libertarians out there will say "Who needs police?  Let the
telephone company hire people to enforce its own contracts."  A
gambling debt cannot be enforced in court in Nevada, but somehow few
people find it a good idea to stiff the casinos.  Do you really want
the whole world to run like that?)  You use those goods, you incur
obligations.  With rights come responsibilities.

There is certainly room for a legitimate debate about *what*
regulations it is desireable and proper for society to impose - the
government *is* the (admittedly imperfect) arm of society whose task
is to impose regulations - on telephone companies, or any other
enterprise.  What I find distressing is the blind kow-towing to the
technological imperative - if it *can* be done, we *must* do it, and
society be damned.  Does anyone really believe that?  Let's go back to
Mr. Meeks's statement and change it a bit:  "Never again, under the
provisions of this bill, will a medical database provider be able to
develop a service or technology without first and foremost asking the
question:  How can I design this so that it pops off the assembly line
ready to protect the privacy of the patients whose records it
contains?"  Does it still sound like such a bad thing?

No, what we really have here, hidden under a supposed appeal to
technological requirements, is the same belief that law enforcement
agencies just should not be able to tap telephone calls, no matter
what.  It makes no difference what limits are placed on the tapping,
what kinds of oversight there is; because tapping can be abused - and
because it's pretty clear that a populace worried about crime is
perfectly willing to allow for tapping under controlled circumstances
- what's needed is a technological fix that will simply render the
whole question moot.  That this fix will come at zero apparent cost -
the paranoid won't even have to get hold of encryption boxes - only
makes it look better.  If you really and truly believe this, ask
yourself why you are not arguing against license plates, or for that
matter driver's licenses, which have probably been abused to invade
privacy much more often than telephone taps.

On another note, I also find it distressing that many have bought into
the sob story from the telcos about costs.  The government - that's
*us*, in case you haven't noticed - tosses in $500 million, and the
response from the telcos is to be upset that, if their costs are
greater, they might actually have to pay up - or be subject to
penalties.  How much money did the government put up when it forced
auto manufacturers to make cleaner engines?  Engines with higher
mileage ratings?  Seat belts?  Air bags?  Third brake lights?  How
much is California offering to pay them to come up with
"zero-polution" vehicles?  How much does it pay your local grocer
toward the purchase of a cash register with dual recording rolls of
paper tape?  (Do you think a grocer *needs* such a cash register to
run his business?)  Do you think the penalties if these businesses
don't comply will be a government letter saying, "Well, you tried,
sorry you couldn't do better - see you next year?"
