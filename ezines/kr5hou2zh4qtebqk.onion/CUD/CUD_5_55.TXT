Subject: File 1--"What is CPSR and how can we Join?"

((MODERATORS' NOTE:  CPSR, like EFF, is dedicated to improving
cyberspace. CPSR has been relatively low-key in expanding its
membership, and we asked them to provide some information on what they
do and how people can join. In our view, it's a dynamic and productive
organization, and one well worth supporting by joining. CPSR has been
instrumental in filing a number of FOIA suits related to Operation Sun
Devil and other law enforcement abuses, in lobbying efforts, and most
recently, in filing FOIA requests and suits to peruse the U.S. Secret
Service's role in the surveillance of the 2600 meeting in Washington,
D.C., last fall. As the following summary indicates, CPSR is
interested in a wide range of activities, and their track record over
the years has been rather impressive)).

************************************************************************
         COMPUTER PROFESSIONALS FOR SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY
************************************************************************

CPSR empowers computer professionals and computer users to
advocate for the responsible use of information technology and
empowers all who use computer technology to participate in the
public debate.   As technical experts, CPSR members provide the
public and policymakers with realistic assessments of the power,
promise, and limitations of  computer technology.  As an organization
of concerned citizens, CPSR directs public attention to critical choices
concerning the applications of computing and how those choices
affect society.

Every project we undertake is based on five principles:

*  We foster and support public discussion of and public
   responsibility for decisions involving the use of computers in
   systems critical to society.

*  We work to dispel popular myths about the infallibility of
   technological systems.

*  We challenge the assumption that technology alone can solve
   political and social problems.

*  We critically examine social and technical issues within
   the computer profession, nationally and internationally.

*  We encourage the use of computer technology to improve the
   quality of life.


Founded in 1981 by a small group of computer scientists concerned
about the use of computers in nuclear weapons systems, CPSR has
grown into a national public-interest alliance of computer industry
professionals  dedicated to examining the impact of  technology on
society.

************************************************************************
                         CPSR PROJECTS
************************************************************************

As computer technology becomes increasingly pervasive, the issues
facing us become more complex.  CPSR provides a forum where we
can examine technology's impact on our lives, the lives of our fellow
citizens, and on society as a whole.  By sponsoring both national and
local projects, CPSR serves as a catalyst for in-depth discussion and
effective action in key areas:

     Civil Liberties and Privacy

     The National Information Infrastructure

     Workplace Issues and Participatory Design

     Reliability and Risk

In addition, CPSR's chapter-based projects and national
working groups tackle issues ranging from the development
of nanotechnology and virtual reality to computing and ethics
to community computing to computers and education.

************************************************************************
                     HOW TO BECOME A MEMBER

Subject: File 2--Incident Response Workshop info

  ** NOTE: July 10 is the deadline for discounted registration!! **

			  PRELIMINARY AGENDA
	   5th Computer Security Incident Handling Workshop
Sponsored by the Forum of Incident Response and Security Teams (FIRST)

			  August 10-13, 1993
			    St. Louis, MO


TUESDAY, August 10, 1993  Full-day Tutorials

1.  Creating a Security Policy
    presented by Charles Cresson Wood:

      [no abstract available at time of posting]

2.  Vulnerabilities of the IBM PC Architecture: Virus, Worms, Trojan
      Horses, and Things That Go Bump In The Night
    presented by A. Padgett Peterson:

  An intensive look into the architecture of the IBM-PC and MS/PC-DOS --
  What it is and why it was designed that way. An understanding of
  assembly language and the interrupt structure of the Intel 80x86
  processor is helpful.

  The day will begin with the BIOS and what makes the PC a fully
  functional computer before any higher operating system is introduced.
  Next will be a discussion of the various operating systems, what they
  add and what is masked. Finally, the role and effects of the PC and
  various LAN configurations (peer-peer and client server) will be
  examined with emphasis on the potential protection afforded by login
  scripting and RIGHTS.

  At each step, vulnerabilities will be examined and demonstrations
  made of how malicious software exploits them. Demonstrations may
  include STONED, MICHELANGELO, AZUSA, FORM, JERUSALEM, SUNDAY, 4096,
  and EXEBUG viruses depending on time and equipment available.

  On completion attendees will understand the vulnerabilities and how
  to detect attempted exploitation using simple tools included with
  DOS such as DEBUG and MEM.

3.  Unix Security
    presented by Matt Bishop:

  Unix can be a secure operating system if the appropriate controls and
  tools are used.  However, it is difficult for even experienced system
  administrators to know all the appropriate controls to use.  This
  tutorial covers the most important aspects of Unix security
  administration, including internal and external controls, useful
  tools, and administration techniques to develop better security.

  Upon completion, Unix system administrators will have a better
  understanding of vulnerabilities in Unix, and of methods to protect
  their systems.

THE WORKSHOP

     A good  working definition of science fiction is "speculative ex-
trapolation about  the effect  of science  and technology on society".
The aim of this International Workshop is to provide a forum for iden-
tifying, encouraging  and discussing  research about science and tech-
nology, or  their consequences,  as portrayed  in science fiction. The
Workshop will  bring together  researchers, scientists, and other aca-
demics with science fiction professionals to share information and ex-
plore new  ideas  about  the  relationship  between  science  fiction,
science and technology.


TOPICS OF INTEREST
     The topics of interest include but are not limited to:
          -  Biotechnology, genetic engineering
          -  Computer science, robotics, artificial intelligence
          -  Macroengineering

Subject: File 4--New hearing set for E-Fingerprinting in SF

NEW HEARING SET FOR JULY 27 on ELECTRONIC FINGERPRINTING for
WELFARE RECIPIENTS IN SAN FRANCISCO

Once again electronic fingerprinting for San Francisco welfare
recipients is on the Board of Supervisors agenda. A formal request has
been made by the SF Department of Social Services (DSS) to change the
ordinance governing General Assistance (GA) to begin requiring
electronic fingerprints as a condition for receiving GA benefits.
Prints are matched ostensibly to prevent people from obtaining aid
more than once.

A hearing on the ordinance has been set for TUESDAY, JULY 27 at 2:00
p.m. in Room 228 of City Hall, San Francisco.

The Automated Fingerprint Image Reporting and Match (AFIRM) system is
essentially a _political_ plan, using vague and unsubstantiated claims
of welfare fraud as a justification for installing the computer
system. That is, it is NOT a real fiscal savings plan and is incapable
of introducing "accountability" into the welfare system, because no
data exists to support its use (see below for details). As such the
only way that the AFIRM system will be stopped is by raising as much
noise about it as possible. If you think that electronic
fingerprinting is a bad idea, please let the following supervisors
know, and/or come to the hearing:

Supervisor Willie Kennedy
(415) 554-5734 (voice)
(415) 554-7034 (fax)

Supervisor Barbara Kaufman
(415) 554-4880 (voice)
(415) 554-4885 (fax)

Supervisor Annemarie Conroy
(415) 554-7788 (voice)
(415) 554-5163 (fax)

Mail address for all supervisors:
Room 235
City Hall
San Francisco, CA 94102

*******
Here are some abbreviated details on the situation. I have a
longer question/answer analysis type background piece which I'm
happy to send to you, you can also FTP it from cpsr.org
(/ftp/cpsr/fingerprints/sffinger.analysis)


Key points are:

-- IT'S NOT CLEAR THAT THERE IS A NEED FOR THE SYSTEM, OR THAT THE
SYSTEM WILL SAVE ANY MONEY

The Department of Social Services (DSS) has presented NO DATA to
substantiate how extensive the problem of "double-dipping" is, and
data from Los Angeles County (which has been using the same system for
two years) and Alameda County (using it since February) shows that the
problem may be quite minuscule. Wild claims of cost-savings by Los
Angeles and Alameda Counties do not stand up to careful scrutiny.
During a changeover period, cases are closed for "non-compliance" if
people fail to show up for their fingerprint appointment. I.e., no
evidence of "fraud deterred" exists. It appears that cases counted as
being closed because of the fingerprint program include cases that
would already have been closed because of the normal 15 - 20% monthly
turnover in GA cases (i.e., they would have been closed anyway, but
are assigned as savings to AFIRM). "Non-compliance" could be the
result of lost mail, lack of bus fare, paperwork screw-up, mental
disability, or confusion about the rule change. Actual fraud that does
occur may be caught by existing DSS security measures, including their
ID process, social security number matching with other counties, the
Fraud Early Detection Program, etc, so are unfairly assigned to the
AFIRM system. And the cost of the system is probably understated.
After an accurate cost-benefit accounting is made (none has been done
yet), it could very well show that the system does NOT save _any_
money.


-- THERE ARE PROFOUND PRIVACY CONCERNS.

EDS, the computer services giant, will store and process the data.
The data will be shared with other counties. The police, legally,
under specific conditions, may get information from DSS on recipients.
Conceivably this will include some kind of access to, or search
capability of, the fingerprint data. And laws governing access to
confidential welfare data may change. Historically, breaches in
privacy protection have started with welfare programs (e.g., computer
matching of data in 1977), and from their extend to other programs
after the precedent has been established.


-- IT PUSHES SOCIAL SERVICES TOWARDS BEING A LAW ENFORCEMENT ACTIVITY.

Regardless of its extension into many areas, fingerprinting is still
commonly perceived as a law enforcement technology. While
fingerprinting in some professions has a rationale because public
safety is involved, or for personal security reasons, these do not
apply to its use in welfare, where people must rely on the government
for their survival. Being poor is technically not a crime, but the
fingerprinting scheme reinforces this too common perception.

-- THE AFIRM SYSTEM IS DESIGNED FOR EXPANSION.

After GA, fingerprinting will extend to AFDC (mostly welfare mothers &
kids). LA County is planning to extend AFIRM to AFDC recipients, as a
pilot program this summer. This will quadruple the records on their
system to 400,000. Will they fingerprint the kids? After that, food
stamps is a likely candidate. Then we are well on the way to
establishing a national poverty database. As the system extends to
more government programs, it becomes a threat to everyone.


In short, the electronic fingerprinting scheme is a bad idea. It is an
expensive solution to a problem of unknown (but most likely
overstated) dimensions, which will have undetermined results, with
potentially serious negative side-effects. The proposed AFIRM system
is not focused, cheap, or safe enough to merit its social and
financial cost. The system is simply a poor use of taxpayer
money.

Again letters, faxes, and phone calls are important!
