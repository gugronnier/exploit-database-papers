PRESS RELEASE May 5, 1994 - For Immediate Release

          SECRET SERVICE PAYS DAMAGES TO STEVE JACKSON GAMES

On March 1, 1990, agents of the US Secret Service invaded the offices
of Steve Jackson Games, in Austin, Texas, in what became a landmark
case for the rights of computer users. The agents seized several
computers, including the company's BBS, and hundreds of computer
disks. Among the files taken were several uncompleted books, including
one that was about to go to the printer!

    The raid was carried out under a sealed warrant. It was eventually
revealed that the Secret Service was investigating an imaginary
"conspiracy" based on false information, and knew it had no grounds to
suspect SJ Games of any crime, but had never even considered asking
the company for its cooperation while planning the raid!

On March 12, 1993, a federal judge ruled for Steve Jackson Games and
its co-plaintiffs - Steve Jackson himself and three users of the
Illuminati Bulletin Board - on two separate counts.  Judge Sam Sparks
ruled for SJ Games on the PPA (Privacy Protection Act), saying that
the publisher's work product was unlawfully seized and held. Under the
ECPA (Electronic Communications Privacy Act), he ruled that the Secret
Service had unlawfully read, disclosed and erased the computer
messages on the BBS - despite their repeated denials that they had
done any such thing. On a separate ECPA count, he ruled for the
defendants, saying that taking the computer out the door was not an
"interception" of the messages on it within the meaning of the law.
That decision is now being appealed.

Judge Sparks' opinion was harshly critical of the Secret Service's
behavior before, during and after their raid, calling the affidavit
and warrant preparation "simply sloppy and not carefully done."

Now, more than a year later, the Secret Service has finally paid the
judgment. The checks received today included $1,000 per plaintiff
under the ECPA, plus about 3% interest since the judgment. Under the
PPA, SJ Games received $52,431.50 for lost profits and direct costs of
the raid.  The government agreed to pay additional costs of the suit,
originally borne by the EFF and the attorneys, adding another
$252,405.54.

Commented Jackson: "The heroes in this case are the people at the EFF
and the attorneys who put it together - especially Sharon Beckman at
Silverglate & Good, and Pete Kennedy at George, Donaldson and Ford.
Without them, we never would have had our day in court. They made a
big investment in justice.  "As for us, we'll use our share to pay off
old debts and buy new computers."

Since the raid, Jackson's bulletin board service has grown hugely.
Originally a one-line forum for game fans, it is now a full-scale
Internet access service, specializing in helping newcomers learn their
way around the Net. Doing business as "Illuminati Online," Jackson now
serves over a thousand paying customers, with more signing up every
day. "If not for the raid, I wouldn't have done it," he says. "It
brought home to me how important the Internet is becoming. And even if
we protect our legal right to be on the info highway, somebody has to
teach people how to use it!"

Subject: File 2--"Why Censoring Cyberspace is Futile" (H. Rheingold reprint)

By Howard Rheingold. Originally published in the San Francisco
Examiner, part of a weekly series of columns called "Tomorrow."
Reposted with permission.]

=======================================
vc.181: Howard Rheingold's "Tomorrow" Columns Online vc.181.27: Howard
Rheingold (hlr)  Tue 5 Apr 94 20:30
 The following appeared in the San Francisco Examiner on April 6, 1994

                  Why Censoring Cyberspace Is Futile
                         By Howard Rheingold

 For years, many Netheads had a recurring nightmare that a pedophile
 would use a computer bulletin board system to make contact with a
 child, and follow up with physical abuse offline. Now this nightmare
 has become a reality. (See the news pages of today's Examiner.)

 It is only a matter of time before law enforcement authorities use
 cases like this to crack down on the free-wheeling,
 everything-is-permitted culture of cyberspace. It's not hard to
 imagine Jesse Helms standing before the US Senate, holding up an
 X-rated image downloaded from the Internet, raging indignantly about
 "public funds for porno highways."

 As the public begins to realize that communications technology is
 exposing them to an unlimited array of words and images, including
 some they might find thoroughly repulsive, the clamor for censorship
 and government regulation of the electronic highway is sure to begin.

 But it would be a mistake to let traffic cops start pulling people
 over on the highway.

 Yes, we have to think about ways of protecting our children and our
 society from the easy availability of every kind of abhorrent
 information imaginable.  But the "censor the Net" approach is not
 just morally misguided.  It's becoming technically impossible. As Net
 pioneer John Gilmore is often quoted: "The Net interprets censorship
 as damage and routes around it."

 The Net's technological foundation was built to withstand nuclear
 attack. The RAND Corporation designed the network to be a thoroughly
 decentralized command-and-control-and communications system, one that
 would be less vulnerable to intercontinental missiles than a system
 commanded by a centralized headquarters.

 This decentralization of control means that the delivery system for
 salacious materials is the same worldwide one that delivers economic
 opportunity, educational resources, civic forums, and health advice.
 If a hacker in Helsinki or Los Angeles connects to the Internet and
 provides access to his digital porno files, anybody anywhere else in
 the world, with the right kind of Internet connection, can download
 those steamy bits and bytes.

 This technological shock to our moral codes means that in the future,
 we are going to have to teach our children well. The locus of control
 is going to have to be in their heads and hearts, not in the laws or
 machines that make information so imperviously available. Before we
 let our kids loose on the Internet, they better have a solid moral
 grounding and some common sense.

 I bought an Internet account for my daughter when she was eight years
 old, so we could exchange e-mail when I was on the road. But I didn't
 turn her loose until I filled her in on some facts of online life.
 "Just because someone sends you mail, you don't have to answer unless
 you know them," I instructed her. "And if anybody asks if you are
 home alone, or says something to you that makes you feel funny about
 answering, then just don't answer until you speak to me."

 The worldwide virtual communities that provide  users with
 companionship, personal support, enlightenment, and entertainment can
 also contain imposters and worse. Your 14 year old might look like he
 is doing his homework, but is actually secretly joining a hot chat
 session with lecherous strangers. (The same dangers exist with the
 telephone -- ask parents who have had to pay hefty bills for their
 kids' 976 habits.)

 You should have the the right, and the ability, to restrict the
 massive information-flow into your home, to exclude subject matter
 that you don't want your children to see. But sooner or later, your
 children will be exposed to everything you have shielded them from,
 and then all they will have left to deal with these shocking sights
 and sounds is the moral fiber you helped them cultivate.

 Teach your children to be politely but firmly skeptical about
 anything they see or hear on the Net. Teach them to have no fear of
 rejecting images or communications that repel or frighten them. Teach
 them to have a strong sense of their own personal boundaries, of
 their right to defend those boundaries physically and socially. Teach
 them that people aren't always who they present themselves to be in
 e-mail and that predators exist. Teach them to keep personal
 information private. Teach them to trust you enough to confide in you
 if something doesn't seem right.

 Yes, pedophiles and pornographers use computer networks. They also
 use telephones and the mail, but nobody would argue that we need to
 censor or shut down these forms of communication. The most relevant
 question now is: how do we teach our children to live, in an
 uncensorable world?

                      The Great Clipper Debate:
              National Security or National Surveillance?


Sponsored by:  The Georgetown University Law Center Space Law Group
               and Communications Law Forum

In Coordination with:    The George Washington University Institute for
Computer and Telecommunications Systems Policy, the Association for
Computing Machinery Special Interest Group for Computers and Society, and
the American Bar Association Criminal Justice Section.

Date and Time:    May 9, 1994, at 7:30 p.m.

Place:            The Georgetown University Law Center(Moot Court Room)
                  600 New Jersey Avenue, N.W., Washington, D.C.



     The Administration, through the Department of Justice and the
National Security Agency, has proposed a standard encryption algorithm
for both the public and commercial marketplace, with the goal of making
this algorithm the method of choice for persons wishing to encode their
telephone and other voice and data communications.  The  FBI and the NSA
are concerned that the increasing availability, and affordability, of
encryption mechanisms will make it difficult and in some cases impossible
for law enforcement and intelligence agencies to tap into and to
understand the communications of criminals and other pertinent groups.
This proposal has become known as the "Clipper Chip,"  in that it would
be implemented by the voluntary insertion of a computer chip into
telephone, fax machine, and other communications systems.

     The Clipper Chip has generated considerable controversy.  Opposing
it are various civil libertarian groups, as well as telecommunications
companies, software and hardware manufacturers, and trade associations.
The debate has raged behind closed doors, and openly in the press.

     On Monday, May 9, at the Georgetown University Law School, a round
table debate will take place on this controversy.  The participants
represent both sides of the issue, and are illustrative of the various
groups which have taken a stand.  The participants are:

        Dorothy Denning, Chairperson of the Computer Science Department
        of Georgetown University

        Michael Godwin, Legal Counsel of the Electronic Frontier
        Foundation;

        Geoffrey Greiveldinger, Special Counsel to the Narcotic and
        Dangerous Drug Section of the U.S. Department of Justice;

        Michael Nelson, of the Office of Science and Technology Policy
        of the White House;

        Marc Rotenberg, Director of the Electronic Privacy Information
        Center; and

        Stephen Walker, President of Trusted Information Systems, Inc.,
        and a former cryptographer with the National Security Agency

     In addition, there will be two moderators:  Dr. Lance
Hoffman, Professor of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at The
George Washington University, and Andrew Grosso, a former federal
prosecutor who is now an attorney in private practice in the District of
Columbia.

     The program will last approximately two and one half hours, and will
be divided into two parts.  The first half will offer the panel the
opportunity to respond to questions which have been submitted to the
participants beforehand; the second will present the panel with questions
from the audience.

     There is no charge for this program, and members of the public are
encouraged to attend. Reservations are requested in advance, and should
be directed to one of the following individuals:

   - C. Dianne Martin, Associate Professor, Department of Electrical

Subject: File 5--DOJ Clipper documents scheduled for summer release under FOIA

As you know, there has been much debate about the Clipper Chip
initiative, but relatively little hard information.  John Gilmore,
member of the board of directors of the Electronic Frontier
Foundation, filed FOIA requests to numerous government
agencies last April after the Clipper plan was announced.  In
June 1993, he filed a FOIA lawsuit against the Justice Department
("DOJ") and the Federal Bureau of Investigation ("FBI").
Gilmore v. FBI, et al, C-93-2117, U.S. District Judge Charles
Legge, Northern District of California.

As a result of this lawsuit, the Justice Department has agreed to a
staggered release of some documents about Clipper and Digital
Telephony.  The Justice Department and Gilmore signed a joint
stipulation and agreement on Friday, April 29, 1994, in which the
Justice Department and several other federal agencies agreed to
release documents over the next several months:

          a)     DOJ's Office of Information and Privacy ("OIP")  will
transmit all documents recovered in its search for responsive
documents that it has identified as requiring referrals or
consultations to the appropriate agencies or DOJ components by
May 31, 1994.  OIP will complete processing of all documents that
it has identified as not  requiring  referrals  or  consultations  to
other agencies or DOJ components by June 20, 1994.

          b)     DOJ's Justice Management Division ("JMD") will
complete processing of all documents  recovered  in  its  search  for
responsive documents, excluding documents which have been
referred for processing to other agencies, by July 30, 1994.

          0)     The Office of Management and Budget ("OMB") will
respond to all DOJ consultation  requests  which  OMB  had  received
as of April 20, 1994 by May 20, 1994.

          d)     The National Security Agency ("NSA") will  respond  to
all DOJ consultation requests which it  had  received  as  of  April
20, 1994 by July 18, 1994.  NSA  will  complete  processing  of  all
documents which had been referred to it by DOJ as of April 20,
1994 for direct response to plaintiff by July 18, 1994.

          e)     The National Security Council ("NSC") will  respond  to
all DOJ consultation requests which NBC had received  as  of  April
20, 1994 by July 29, 1994.

          f)     The Department of Commerce and National Institute  of
Standards and  Technology  (collectively  "Commerce")  will  respond
to all DOJ consultation requests which  Commerce  had  received  as
of April 20, 1994 by August 7, 1994.  Commerce will complete
processing of all documents which had been  referred  to  it  by  DOJ
as of April 20, 1994 for direct  response  to  plaintiff  by  August
7,   1994.

The documents being processed by the NSC include the Presidential Review
Directive and Presidential Decision Directive which started the Clipper
initiative.  We have been informed that NSC is processing the two
final versions as well as 68 draft versions.

We have also been informed that documents produced in the course
of the OMB legislative clearance process for the Digital Telephony
Bill are being processed.  This should provide insight into how the
government decided to proceed with this bill.

We have also been informed that there are approximately 25
documents produced in the course of the government's solicitation
of industry views on Clipper.

Obviously, we do not know how much useful information will be
released.  It is probable that the documents will be heavily redacted.
Given the recent directives from the President and the Attorney General
that all possible discretionary disclosures of information should be made,
we hope, optimistically, that these disclosures will prove illuminating.

Unfortunately, the FBI is not a party to this agreement.  We are in
the process of attempting to obtain the release of about 3000 pages
of FBI records.  FBI has told the Court that it will be approximately
2 years and 8 months before it will even begin processing Gilmore's
request, and that actual processing will take about a year, if not more.
We believe that this delay is unlawful and cannot be countenanced.

From: timk@YCRDI.COM(Tim King)
Subject: File 6--Re: Comment on the Lamacchia case

The legal council for David LaMacchia posted an article in CUD #6.32,
basically asserting that a BBS sysop or other computer administrator
should not be held liable for information transferred illegally
through his computer system, even if the sysop knows that this
activity is occuring.

J. Eric Townsend (jet@NAS.NASA.GOV) responded, "If the SYSOP actively
encourages others to use the system, doesn't that somehow change this?
This is something like saying that because a bar owner isn't
responsible for the activities of prostitutes, they should go out and
encourage prostitutes to frequent their bar."

I am interested in understanding this point of view, but I don't see
how the statement addresses the issue.  The original statement did not
say that bar owners _should_ encourage prostitution, although one
might conclude that they _can_.  I'll grant that the analogy holds,
but it hasn't been shown that the hypothetical bar owner is
responsible for the activities of the prostitutes.  Is he?  Why?  By
what reasoning?

Again, Silverglate & Good state, "...Certain classified advertisements
for '_dating services_'... are really covers for high-class
*prostitution* rings.
 Yet...  editors and publishers of the newspapers are *not*
prosecuted... even if the editors and publishers were well aware of
the fact..."

Eric replied, "But what about instances where the editors or
publishers actively sought out 'escort services' to advertise in their
paper, with full knowledge that the 'escort services' were
prostitution rings?"

Okay, what about these instances?  Please describe at least one.  It
is reasonable that the original posters would not cite instances that
had not come to court, and they would have had to in order to support
their claim that editors and publishers are not prosecuted.  But Eric
certainly should be expected to cite instances that have come to
court, in order to support his counter-assertion.

However, Silverglate & Good _did_ cite a case that supported their
position.  (_Smith v. California_, 361 U.S. 147 (1959))  This point
was not addressed at all in Eric's response.

So comes the conclusion, "In short, I don't buy the 1st Amendment
defense in this case."

Okay, but this doesn't change the way the courts view First Amendment
rights, which is the only point on which Silverglate & Good were
relying.  I have not been provided any reason to believe that the
defense has made any false statements, as Eric did not address the
court's view.

Furthermore, it is obvious that the issue has not been treated deeply
enough to give me reason to develop a desire to see the law changed in
this matter.  There was no legal precedent treated.  No one examined
the reasons for which the current rules were established.  Eric did
not even thoroughly address the points that are already on the table.

Therefore, Eric, I don't understand precisely what you want to
accomplish.  Why did you post your original response?  Was it to try
to convince readers of your views?  Although, my gut reaction would be
to agree with your conclusion, you've given me no objective reason to
do so.

Subject: File 8--Net-Letter Guide 5/05

NET-LETTER GUIDE
A newshound's guide to newsy periodicals available through the
Internet. Compiled by John M. Higgins (higgins@dorsai.dorsai.org)
Updated May 5, 1994

  Introduction: My favorite things on the Internet are informative, high-
quality newsletters. The quality of info contributed to what Mitch Kapor
describes as the Net's "gift economy" is amazing. Despite some excellent
e-pub guides, tracking down good NEWSY letters can be frustrating, partly
because they get lost in the flood of zines and very technical pubs.

  So this list aims to point people to the news-oriented net-letters with
somewhat broader appeal. It's not intended to be as comprehensive as
other guides, but helpful nevertheless. Very technical and fanzine
newsletters are not included because they are well covered by other guides.

  GIMME FEEDBACK!! This is just an initial stab, just a dozen or so I've
seen and like (including one I edit!). Some are well-known, others are
not.  Send me your favorite net-letters, particularly if you're the
editor.  Include any subscription information plus a copy.

  HOW TO GET THE NET-LETTER GUIDE: For now, it will be available by
e-mailing higgins@dorsai.dorsai.org, plus Usenet groups alt.zines,
alt.etext, misc.writing, rec.mag, alt.internet.services, alt.answers,
misc.answers, rec.answers, news.answers. If folks like it, other
arrangements will be made.

Subject: File 9--RSA-1,600 number Encryption Code Broken

"1,600 Computers Help Break 129-Digit Code"
(From: Chicago Tribune, 27 April, 1994 (Sect 1, p. 3)

Reuters

     NEW YORK--The world's ultimate secret code--a 129 digit
     combination billed as impossible to break--has finally been
     cracked.

The article explains how 600 people using 1,600 computers linked
together via the internet over five continents cracked the code in
about eight months. Dr. Arjen Lenstra of Bellcore compares the feat to
finding 8.5 million needles in a haystack. Lenstra coordinated the
breaking of the encryption, "names RSA for the first letters of its
three inventors' surnames."

The story explains that the code was devised 17 years ago by computer
scientists adn mathematicians Ronald Rivest, Adi Shamir, and Leonard
Adleman.

     "This discovery is important if you want to protect the code
     guarding something like the secret formula for Coca-Cola or
     nuclear weapons," rivest said at a press conference. He
     suggested the encoders would have to use much longer numbers
     in the future.

The article explains that numerical codes such as RSA 129 are
based on the difficulty of breaking down long numbers into
two sets of prime number (numbers divisible only by itself and
"1"). Lenstra is quoted as saying the breaking of the code
required the longest mathematical computation ever performed.
The secret message that they successfully decrypted was
"The magic words are squeamish ossifrage." The words were chosen
randomly, according to Lenstra.

     Rivest presented Lenstra with a $100 check, the prize he and
     his two colleagues offered when they first presented the
     code to readers of Margin Gardiner's "Mathematical Games"
     column in Scientific American magazine to solve.

     While they billed it as being so hard that it would take 40
     quadrillion years to do, they did not count on the power of
     modern-day computers.
