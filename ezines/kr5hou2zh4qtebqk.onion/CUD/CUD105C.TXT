THE SOFTWARE PUBLISHERS ASSOCIATION: DON'T CALL US, WE'LL CALL YOU.

NOTE!! Several attempts have been made to obtain information from the SPA
regarding their programs, charter, and membership information.  Despite
multiple promises I have not yet received any information that I have
requested.  Therefore what is stated about the organization, it's purpose,
and history is based on independent piece-meal research and has not been
supplied by the SPA.

The Software Publisher's Association is an industry organization composed
of small, medium, and large software publishing firms. One of their chief
activities in the past has been to wage a public relations battle against
"software piracy".  This campaign, largely through print ads in major
computer magazines, has emphasized the illegality of trading software
programs with coworkers and friends.  To my knowledge they have not
directed their attention to the CU realm of the pirate, and in fact, up
until recently, have largely avoided using the label "pirate" at all.

One of the newest "weapons" the SPA has unleashed against software trading
is something called a "corporate audit".  My knowledge of this is hazy (see
above notation) but from what I can gather it is a process that
corporations submit to voluntarily.  The SPA will conduct an audit of
magnetic media (hard drives, etc) used on a corporation's computers to
assist them in complying with copyright laws and license agreements.  Again
the thrust of the program is directed to the corporate world, not the
Computer Underground.

However the SPA has taken some steps to curb the CU trading of "warez".
One of these techniques has been to open a toll-free "snitch line" where
people could call and report BBS systems that have copyrighted programs in
their download areas. This "snitch line" (my term, I don't know what they
call it...again, see above notation.) differs from an SPA program of a few
years ago when they offered a $100.00 dollar reward for turning in Pirate
bulletin board systems. At that time the caller had to supply a list of
downloadable files, the number of the board, the name and address of the
sysop, and a valid sign on and password to the board in question.  To the
best of my knowledge the current program does not offer a monetary reward,
and they extent of the information they are requesting may have changed.

I recently called the "snitch line" as a participant observational
experiment in turning in a Pirate bulletin board.  My intent was to
determine the information collected by the SPA and the conceptualization of
"piracy" and "warez" that was being used.  Below
is an account and  transcript of that conversation.
--------------
Software Publisher's Association  Monday 2/19/90

I dialed the SPA "turn in a pirate board" number that I had picked up
somewhere in my bbs travels. 1-800-388-PIRS...cute, but not cute enough to be
considered bagging the whole warez scene.

The phone was ringing... "Hello, Warren (or something that sounded
like Warren) Travel", a male voice said.

"Errrr, I think I've reached a wrong number, who is this?"

"Warren Travel, are you trying to get a hold of that software place?"

I told him that I was.

"They published our number by accident. Sorry."

I apologized to him and hung up. I should have asked him how many calls
he had been getting...would be some indication of how much activity a
snitch hotline could generate. I wonder if the SPA is paying for this
guys phone bill?  Toll free calls cost about fifty cents...

I then tried toll free information, and asked for the Software Publishers
Association.  No listing.  Hmmmm, have they given up the "report a pirate
line" idea?

I called information for the District of Columbia and got the office
number for the SPA.  After about 10 rings  (yes, ten..this was not at
lunch time) a guy answered...

"Software Publishers Association".

"Hi, I was wondering what kind of mechanisms you have in place for
people who want to report a pirate bulletin board."

"Give me the number." (curtly)

"That's it? That's your mechanism?"

(about 4 seconds of silence)
"What have you got?"

"A pirate bbs, 100 megs, pirated software for IBM, Atari, and Amiga."

(about 3 seconds of silence)

"Where did you get the number?"

"Off a list a bbs somewhere, I don't know for sure."

"What did it say?"

"The listing?  It's a list of BBS's...it said the name of the board and
gave the phone number."

"No, _this_ number." (sounding frustrated or hurried)

"Your number?  I called information and asked for the SPA!"

(silence)

"Can you give us a lot of information on this board? Who's the sysop?
What's his address?"

"I don't know that. All I have is the number and it's a pirate board.
First time callers get full access to all the downloads and you can see
the files right there."

"oh. Well, give me the phone number."

"Okay, 708/555-5555"  (I gave him the phone number for the local
Telenet port.)

(about 3 seconds of silence)
"We'll look into it."

"What are you going to do?"

(more silence)

"We'll look into it."

"I see, and what's your name please?"

(again, some silent hesitation)

"Ken"

"Okay, Ken. Bye."

>click<  (Ken hung up w/out saying anything else)

end of transcript. Total time for call, approx 3 minutes.
____________________________________

I believe the transcript portrays the uninterested, slightly rude manner in
which my call was taken.  The fact that Ken was suspicious of where I had
gotten the number to his office, and failed to  query me as to the
contents, location, etc of the board I was supposedly reporting indicates
to me that either I reached an individual that was not accustomed to
answering the phone for these calls (as may be indicated by the excessive
number of rings he took to answer, maybe the secretary was ill that day)
or, perhaps, a lack of seriousness on the part of the SPA in dealing with
this "crime".

The Software Publishers Association is a leading source of unverified (and
un-verifiable) information regarding the expense and extent of "piracy".
Here we have seen just how interested they appear to be when presented with
an opportunity to squelch what may have been, for all they knew, a "major
supplier of pirated software".

Postscript: I have since learned that the correct number for the "snitch
line" is 800/388-PIR8. As of yet I have not repeated my experiment.  Others
are welcome to do so and I'd appreciate hearing
