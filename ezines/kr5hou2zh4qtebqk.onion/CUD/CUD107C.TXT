Response to Stoll Review
---------------------

Date:     Tue,  1 May 90 21:44 EDT
From:     Stephen Tihor <TIHOR@NYUACF>
Subject:  Cliff Stoll
To:       tk0jut2


Two quick items from times past:

Cliff Stoll is accurately portrayed in his book as being part of the
current thread of the 60's hippy culture.  Despite the reviewer's
assertions %see the review in CuD, #1.06 (eds)%, that culture did not die.
It continues to live as hardy as any weed that can not be completely paved
over or removed.  I met Cliff during the period covered by the book and it
is substantively accurate in all the areas I am directly and indirectly
aware of.

Further I do not view it as a piece of social analysis but as a ripping
good true story.  If de-polemicized, %the reviewer's% comments might form
an interesting commentary to Cliff's actions and reactions as compared with
his mental model of the Cuckoo and as compared to the idealized
non-intrusive "hacker". Unfortunately the reviewer's axe is rather a bit
too clear and, frankly, Cliff's book is irrelevant to the  subject being
discussed as presented.  It is clear that the reviewer has different
standards on right and wrong, on privacy and property rights, and on basic
courtesy than either Cliff, myself, or the bulk of the legislatures and
judiciaries of the United States.

I would also like to mention that I know some of the people involved in
SPAN security and that unlike their characterizations in a  previous
posting they are not unaware of the risks involved in some of the security
configurations of their systems.  Two concerns prevent a much tighter
security curtain in the SPAN areas that I know of.  First, some researchers
were using the accesses for legitimate research, relying on the community
spirit that the reviewer of Mr. Stoll's book claims not to see evidence of
for security.  That changed.  Second there is the general problem of
enforcement in a cooperating anarchy of systems manage by scientists not
professional computer users.  This problem is being address by current
version of the networking software for some of them but having dealt with
them day to day it is hard to explain the risks to someone unfamiliar with
the field and if they do understand they are likely to give up on
computing, remove their systems from the internetwork, or turn into the
witch burners that we are warned against becoming.  None of these seem
particularly good to me although I have know people on various sides of the
fence who would argue for each of them in turn.
