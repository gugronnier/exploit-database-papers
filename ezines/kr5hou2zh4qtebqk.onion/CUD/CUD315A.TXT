The "CU in the News" stories have piled up, so this issue is devoted
to clearing some of the longer files that were bumped from previous
issues.  Just in case you missed the following news blurbs:

++++++++++++++++++++++
CONGRATS TO NEWSBYTES
+++++++++++++++++++++++

NEWSBYTES, an invaluable source of computer-related information,
was awarded the "Best On-Line Publication" by the Computer Press
Association. Newsbytes publishes approximately 30 technology-related
stories daily on GEnie, and is also carried on America OnLine,
NewsNet, Dialog and foreign wire services. It is supported by 18
reporters in bureaus world-wide, and reaches an audience of
4.5 million.

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

+++++++++++++++++++
Anti-Encryption Bill
+++++++++++++++++++

{Snuck into the language of a federal anti-terrorism Bill was the
following small section. If passed, the Bill would require
those who write encryption programs to leave in a "backdoor" that
would allow decryption for "law enforcement" purposes. This would
defeat the purpose of encryption. Apparently the FBI was pushing
for passage of this section. Information and up-dated discusssions
can be found on The Well in Sausalitoito (Calif) and in RISKS Digest.
Thanks to Mike Riddle for his contribution}.

                          102ND CONGRESS; 1ST SESSION

                  Subtitle B-Electronic Communications
SEC. 2201. COOPERATION OF TELECOMMUNICATIONS PROVIDERS WITH LAW
ENFORCEMENT.
  It is the sense of Congress that providers of electronic
communications services and manufacturers of electronic communications
service equipment shall ensure that communications systems permit the
government to obtain the plain text contents of voice, data, and other
communications when appropriately authorized by law.

{A substantial lobbying effort may be needed to block this, which
many see as a potential threat to privacy rights}.
