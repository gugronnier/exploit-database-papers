**MAIL PROBLEMS:**

We are not getting thru all the gateways, so if you know of anybody who has
requested back issues but hasn't heard from us, let us know, or have them
send several addresses we can try. Do not rely on the header has an address,
because it doesn't always work.  "@ORION" has been a special problem.
--------------------------------------------------------------------

**ARCHIVES**:

We're still trying to work out a site to make archives of text files
available. Our own system software can't provide one. A few volunteers have
come forth, but if anybody else can set something up, it might speed things
up.

Current holdings are still sparce. They include:
  a) PHRACK, PIRATE, ATI, LoD/H, P/Hun, and several hundred
     miscellaneous small files.
  b) A Master's thesis and several academic papers
  c) A variety of news clippings, most of which are probably
     copyright protected and cannot be published

WE *STRONGLY* urge anybody who comes across any research papers, news
articles, or other "hard copy" info related to computer underground activity
to send it along so we can build the archives.

We have found it difficult to honor all requests for arhives at once. So, to
get copies of something, for example ATIs, just send periodic requests and
we'll send a few out at a time, and keep sending requests until you have
what you originally wanted.

--------------------------------------------------------------------

**LEGION OF DOOM UPDATE (Indictment news)**:


Many have asked how the LoD/Phrack E911 case(s) is coming.  Well,
unfortunately very little news has reached us regarding the status of the
charges against The Prophet.  Anyone with factual news in this regard is
welcome to submit it... The case against Knight Lightning has a pre-trial
motion pending in the next week or so (late April, '90).  The defense has
asked that the indictment be withdrawn and re-submitted in a form that
eliminates the prejudicial and un-proven allegations presented as fact that
it presently contains.

The actual trial date was once set for early June, but the Government asked
that the pre-trail motion be rescheduled from it's original date of a couple
of weeks ago so I would assume the trial date will also be pushed back
accordingly.

As more facts become known and appropriate to share, we will keep you
updated.

**ANONYMOUS POSTING POLICY**:

We have been asked our policy on anonymous postings. We have previously
defended the use of pseudonyms as necessary, and are willing to post
questions, general information, or articles of a reasonable nature either
with a handle or anonymously.  However, we cannot reproduce flames or
articles for which attribution might be required. Our rationale for allowing
anonymous postings is based on the respect for privacy of those who feel
they have something to say, but who may be afraid of repercussions from
employers or colleagues for speaking in public.  Not everybody realizes that
we still have a first amendment, and speaking in public is not always wise
if one values their job.  Unfortunately, the "chilling effect" has real
sources. Just ask Steve Jackson.

--------------------------------------------------------------------

**CALL FOR ARTICLES:**

We need some people to contribute a few more stories, comments, or articles.
We can try to keep news coming, but were hoping for some lively debate and a
bit more news from various regions.  We know that lots of subscribers are
down on computer underground activity, and we don't want this to be a
one-sided forum. The purpose here is to break down barriers so the two sides
have a better appreciation of the other.
