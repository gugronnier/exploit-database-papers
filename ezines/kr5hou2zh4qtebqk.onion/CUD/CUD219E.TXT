GAIL THACKERAY RE LICENSING MODEMS & RESTRICTING MODEM USE
  On 12/21, as a postscript on e-mail to Gail Thackeray, I asked:
+++++++++++++++++++++++++
  Been meanin' to check this *rumor* for months (I rarely trust what I
haven't checked, personally):  Have you said that modems should be licensed
and their use restricted?  (It's been widely quoted/paraphrased and is a
common [mis?]perception of your views.)  If you ever said it, do you now
hold that view?
  I'm not challenging it; just tryin' to verify or refute a provocative
rumor.

To which, Gail responded:

    No, I never said so -- when talking about the lack of parental
supervision of computer use for beginning youngsters, I have pointed
out that in other instances involving driving, guns, etc. we
recognize that kids don't have good judgment and we insist on training,
supervision, licensing, etc. to minimize the risk to the rest of
society.  I have specifically said that I DON'T want to see licensing
of modems, or FCC regulation, etc. -- but that if we look at historic
parallels involving new technology (driving, airplanes, etc.) when
society grows annoyed/concerned enough with abuses, damage, risk to
others, "entry requirements" such as licensing have been imposed.
I have recommended that to avoid such a trend in electronic technology,
we should put a lot of effort into developing "rules of the road"
that we all agree on and abide by & teach youngsters -- or the back-
lash may cause formal regulation (just think about the regulations
controlling ham radio, etc. -- and the potential for similar rules
is quite real, computer-wise.)
    Regulation usually comes about as a reaction to complaints of
enough  people to attract the interest of legislators.  We are
rapidly approaching that "critical mass" stage with computer
communications, and if we don't want to see licensing of BBS's, we
need to do whatever will curb the abuses (interference with other
people's rights).  I have recommended that parents check into what
their kids are doing with their modems, set rules, ans if need be,
"ground" their kids just as they do for other kinds of rules-
violations, like being reckless with the family car....
--------------------------------------------
This prompted my 12/24 comments and request:
--------------------------------------------
& mail gailt
Subject: licensing etc.
Gail,
  This is important:
  If you have not yet posted exactly those comments, in detail, regarding
licensing and regulation of modem users, I *urge* you to post them
immediately and completely to the eff Conference, and explicitly add a note
encouraging their widespread duplication (without editing, of course)
across the nets.
  You are more than welcome to preface it with a comment that I urged you to
post the comments (if that has any value :-).
  I absolutely agree with your observations and think we have *much* to fear
from overzealous legislators/regulators responding to the miniscule
minority who are abusive of our tremendously productive cooperative anarchy.
...
------------------
I also urged her to send it to jthomas for the Computer Underground Digest
and emmanuel for 2600, and sent mail to both of them urging them to publish
it, if Gail sent it, saying, in part:
------------------
  Her explanation of what she had and had not said related to such matters
was both reasonable and **illustrated a very real threat** (from legislators
and regulators; *not* from Gail T) against all of us.  Her comments were
very realistic; her prognosis highly likely, if we cannot exercise adequate
discipline within our ranks.
  I have urged her to post her comments on the WELL, and forward them to
Cud and 2600 for publication (and release them for general posting around
the nets).
---------------------------------------------------------------
I hope you will help do so, because we now have her permission:

was sent in E-mail went into the cosmic winds.... is there a way I
can retrieve what I sent you, & post it?  Can you retireve & upload
it?  I'm (definitely) still stumblin' around here, and help would be
great/grate/fully accepted....

   By the by -- feel free to use it -- I just don't know (after scanning%

e-mail.  ...
**************
For those who don't know of Ms. Thackeray, she is an Assistant State
Attorney General for the State of Arizona, active in pursuing computer
crime, and controversial for some of her public statements and/or
statements that.some press *allege* she said.  In some cases, she may have
been as misleadingly quoted-out-of-context -- or flat-out abusively
misquoted -- as has been the case with some reports about Mitch Kapor, John
Perry Barlow and the Electronic Frontier Foundation.
