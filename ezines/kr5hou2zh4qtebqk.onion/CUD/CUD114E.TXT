Unfortunately, much of what Frank subsequently says about law-enforcement
procedures in this country is either nonfactual or illogical or both.

So far as I know, there has been no dispute as to whether any of the
Operation Sun Devil searches and seizures were warrantless. Critics of this
operation are not claiming that the searches and seizures lacked warrants,
but that the warrant-approval process has proved to be an insufficient
protection of Fourth Amendment rights.

This comes as no surprise, of course, to those who have more than a high
school civics textbook familiarity with criminal procedure.

>Warrants are issued by judges and are based on evidence.

Not exactly. Typically, warrants are issued by judges (or some other
"neutral magistrate") on the basis of affidavits written by law-enforcement
agents. The agents describe and characterize the illegal activity they seek
to investigate. So long as the FORM of warrant-seeking procedure is adhered
to, the content of the warrant is rarely (one is tempted to say "never,"
but that's not quite true) inquired into by the judge. The procedure is
NONadversarial--that is, there's no one there to challenge the
law-enforcement agent's characterization of the facts. So long as the judge
has no reason to believe that the agent is INVENTING facts, she'll normally
approve the warrant.

But the agent's good faith is NOT a measure of the accuracy of the
information contained in a warrant, especially in computer-crime cases, in
which the very nature of the property crime is being defined in the process
of prosecuting alleged wrongdoers. (These are the cases that will set the
precedents for how the federal computer-crime law will be interpreted in
the future.)

There is little doubt that the agents have a good-faith belief that they
are going after genuine wrongdoers. But to assume that law-enforcement
officials have any kind of *objective* sense of the magnitude and damage of
the "crimes" being prosecuted here is to misunderstand the character of
federal law-enforcement--generally, these are a bunch of zealous (and
sometimes over-zealous) policemen who tend to define the reach of federal
crime statutes VERY broadly.

This is more or less a non sequitur. It ignores the fact that warrants,
like indictments, are *rhetorical* documents, designed to convince the
reader that the goals of the writer are correct.  The question is not
whether the facts are wrong, but how they are characterized for rhetorical
purposes.

This assumes that if the Fifth Amendment requirement of Due Process (as
well as, I assume, the Fourth Amendment requirement of "reasonable"
searches and seizures), there can be no First Amendment interests at stake.
This is a misreading of Constitutional Law; the requirements of the
respective Amendments must be met independently of each other.

>Indictments are handed down by grand juries - your peers.  Indictments

This is incorrect. The presumption of innocence is never overcome by
grand-jury indictments, even if the allegations contained therein are
unrefuted.

Properly, one should say that a grand-jury indictment reflects a prima
facie case against the defendant(s), who are nevertheless presumed innocent
until judged guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.

>INDICTMENTS ALSO SERVE TO PROTECT
>THE ACCUSED AGAINST FRIVOLOUS PROSECUTIONS.

No, they do not. The grand-jury process is NOT a screen against any kind of
prosecution, regardless of what you may have been told.  Patrick allowed in
his comment to your letter that "sometimes" grand juries are merely
rubber-stamps for prosecutors. "Sometimes" actually is "the great majority
of the time"--it was not for nothing that Rudy Giuliani said he could get
the jury to indict a ham sandwich.  Grand-jury proceedings are orchestrated
by prosecutors, and no one has a right to have her attorney present when
questioned by the grand jury.

>Once you have been indicted you
>go to trial.  The indictment is not a guilty verdict!

No, but it vastly increases the likelihood of one, especially if it comes
from a federal grand jury. Assuming that you can afford the cost of
defending yourself in federal court (most people find the cost crippling),
you're up against an organization that has fact-gathering organizations in
every state in the U.S., and whose agents have automatic credibility with
most jurors.

How soon we forget the 1960s!

Or, perhaps, on misc.legal, where this topic has been discussed in the
past.

>in these cases.  I think we need to read the law and look at the way
>the courts apply the law.  It's not helpful to argue a case on the
>basis of what you think the law should be.

Sure it is, when the law is being interpreted in new and more expansive ways.
Moreover, given the fact that even unindicted third parties can be crippled by
overzealous (but warranted) seizures, Fourth Amendment interests require that
we tell judges and legislators how we think the law should be interpreted.

This statement assumes that law-enforcement folks have no discretion in how
they conduct their searches or prosecutions. This is untrue.  Some
law-enforcement agents have a great deal of respect for the Constitution,
while others have an us/them mentality that motivates them to pay only
cursory attention to the Constitutional interests at stake.

Yes, indeed. Which is one of the main problems.

Sysops who received common-carrier status would be a bit dismayed at their
inability to deny access to some users. What is needed is a new status,
somewhere between common-carrier and private-operator status.  Such a
middle ground would allow sysops to control their user bases while not
being required to read every bit of verbal information that is transferred
into or through their systems.

It may be that Len Rose was indicted for "stealing source code" (I haven't
seen that particular indictment), but the other Legion of Doom indictments
concern the alleged "theft" of an E911 text document. Many newspapers and
journals have misreported this.

Disclaimer: I have a law degree, but until I take and pass the bar exam, I
won't be a lawyer, either.
