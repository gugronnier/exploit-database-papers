The U.S. Attorney's office in Boston announced on Friday, January 27,
that it will not appeal the dismissal of its legal case against MIT
student David LaMacchia.  The case was dismissed by District Judge
Richard G. Stearns on December 29.

In announcing his decision, the U.S. Attorney Donald K. Stern
underscored his intent to work toward initiating new legislation
"which would remove any uncertainty that willful, multiple
infringements of copyrighted software, even where there is no
commercial motive, is illegal."

Information about the case, including the most recent announcement by
the U.S. Attorney, can be found on the David LaMacchia Defense Fund
(DLDF) homepage, or by request.

        Should the Government Hold the Master Keys to Electronic Commerce?
(A Public Debate of the Administration's Clipper Chip and Key Escrow Initiative)

[Following is my review of the Clipper Chip public debate.  I have attempted to
 be as accurate as possible, but have had to paraphrase the participants.  My
 overall impressions from the pro-Clipper side were that Clipper Chip as a
 technology may be dead,
but that key escrow by the government was moving forward.  From the con-Clipper
 side, I was left wondering, would we agree to key escrow if cryptographic
 export controls were lifted? - DaVe McComb]

 [Opening Statements]

SB:     We need the Clipper Chip to stop threats to the US.

DW:     Clipper hasn't succeeded commercially.  There are problems with export
 controls and privacy.  The belief that terrorists and drug dealers will be
 stopped by Clipper is ridiculous; they won't use Clipper.  I forsee a new field
 developing in the future;
 that of "Mob Cryptographer."

JK:     We have to protect ourselves and our children against terrorists, child
 pornographers, kidnappers, the selling of trade secrets, and drug dealers.
 Would you buy a car or house if you were told, "If you lose the keys, you can
 never get back in?"

WW:     There are many legitimate uses of cryptography.  However, Clipper is not
 compatible with the installed base of software.  Also, non-US firms will not
 embrace a technology that the US government has the keys to.

MN:     The federal government needs good cryptography to build the National
 Information Infrastructure.  However, this cryptography must not affect law
 enforcement.  We had three choices:  weak crypto - easy wiretap; strong crypto
 - no wiretap; or Clipper -
strong crypto with the capability for wiretaps.  Clipper was designed for the
 government and is voluntary.  Clipper only solves the problem of voice
 encryption and not data encryption.  Also, it's in hardware and therefore more
 costly.

[Start of debate]
DW:     Why should users turn down Clipper?  Matt Blaze found a flaw in Capstone
 that cast doubt on the whole project.  We shouldn't accept a "secret"
 algorithm; there's no confidence in the security of the algorithm.  Also, for
 key escrow, the keys are held
by two federal agencies.  Why should we trust them?  Both agencies are
 responsible to the president and there are no binding government statutes
 regulating access to the keys.

MN:     The government has to get a court order for a wiretap in order to get th
e
 data before they even go to the key escrow agencies.  Therefore, we now have
 two layers of protection:  the wiretap order and obtaining the keys from the
 escrow agencies.  Also,
 the Blaze attack only showed that by not using the LEAF, it was possible to
 undermine the authorities.

SB:     Who would you rather trust to hold the keys?  Private business or a
 democratic system with automatic checks and balances.

DW:     New technology presents new problems.  People already know about
 cryptography.  And criminals won't go to Radio Shack to buy their "NSA
 Approved" crypto phone or modem.

WW:     This is not a US only problem.  However, Clipper is a US solution to a
 vastly expanding global electronic marketplace.  Would we trust other
 governments?  No.  Why should they trust the US government?

        I am part of the "Key Escrow Alternatives Working Group."  We're a group
 of
 50-60 industry representatives who are looking for alternatives.  We're trying
 to work with the government, but having frustrating results.

MN:     The questions we've received from this group are being dealt with, howev
er
 they directly impact the national security policy.  One of these unanswered
 questions is: "Will the government allow exportation of cryptography if the
 keys are escrowed?"  The
 goal of the government is to export cryptography only if national security is
 not compromised.  We're working towards the ideal, but we're not there yet.
 Clipper helps to meet this goal.

AW:     Are there any concrete proposals to replace Clipper?

MN:     Some companies have proposed DES coupled with key escrow and the governm
ent
 is talking about these concepts.  However, it will take several months to
 review these new products.  Clipper does have a secret algorithm, but it has
 been tested by a number
of top cryptographers.

DW:     Here's the lesson of Clipper:  the government should not be in the busin
ess
 of designing cryptographic products.  They should work out the legislative
 concerns, like exportation.  Taking from Maria Cantwell's letter, we want any
 solution to be: unclas
sified, voluntary, exportable, able to be implemented in software, have
 guarantees for the liability of the escrow agencies, and ensure the privacy of
 the escrow agencies.  My personal top two concerns are: exportable and
 voluntary.  When the 1968 Wiretap
 Bill was proposed, civil liberty groups felt that wiretaps constituted secret
 searches and violated the 4th Amendment.  We should see that it is not an
 absolute right of the government to conduct searches.

JK:     The government has to protect the citizens.  How would you feel if your
 child was enticed into some snuff film, or killed?

MN:     We are looking at other possible escrow agencies.  The first two we chos
e
 were for use by the government, so two other government agencies were picked.

AW:     How would the escrow agencies be regulated?  What would happen if the ke
y
 was improperly released?

SB:     It's difficult to say, especially if the government holds the keys.  If
they
 were held by private businesses, they would have direct liability.

AW:     As far as export controls go, cryptographic printed materials and Intern
et
 traffic easily go overseas, yet software and hardware cannot.

SB:     In the 80's the government viewed cryptography in much the same way as
 atomic bomb making.  It was put on the munitions list.  However, in the last 10
 years we have seen many commercial uses.  Also, importing crypto into other
 countries is difficult a
s well, especially France.

WW:     IBM invented the basic algorithm for DES as a result of a call by govern
ment
 to protect both business and government data.  As soon as it was made the
 standard, export controls were slapped on it.  Now there are substantial
 implementations of DES by f
oreign companies.  IBM is not thrilled when we can't deliver DES solutions to a
 foreign company, and we lose the business to a foreign DES product.  As for
 France, they don't have an import law, they have a registration law whereby the
 French government i
ssues a registration certificate.  The main export problem is the US laws, not
 foreign government import laws.

DW:     The Schneier book was allowed out of the country, and it contained C cod
e in
 printed form.  However, a disk with that same code would not be allowed out of
 the country.

MN:     There probably are cases where US companies lose business, but the
 government is accomplishing their goal of preventing the spread of this
 technology.  We can ensure that Libya does not get the Clipper technology.

[Closing Remarks]

JK:     As technology advances, there's no easy solution.  Clipper was not the
 cure-all/end-all.  Other technologies have the same problems:  the picture
 phone is great until some pervert exposes himself to you and your family by
 using it.  We can offer stron
g crypto and the only people who have to fear us are the criminals.

DW:     Clipper as a policy solution is a dead end.  We have to move on.  Law
 enforcement is being unfairly advantaged and individuals lose their privacy.

SB:     When Clipper was announced, there was a great uproar.  The administratio
n is
 standing firm - We will not allow criminal activity on the Internet.  The idea
 of escrow has slowly sunk in with business.  As this goes on, we'll see a
 convergence of busine
ss and government between escrow and the method of cryptography.

WW:     The government can relax export controls by loosening restrictions on
 exporting cryptography to "friendly" countries.  For example, Ford in Germany
 can buy IBM cryptographic solutions, but Mercedes Benz cannot.  Also, the users
 would like the freedom
of choice to choose the best cryptographic product for them.  We need
 cooperation between the private and public sector.

MN:     Everyone wants the following:  easing export restrictions, a software
 solution, ease of use, inexpensive, public algorithm, and law enforcement.
 Clipper was the first step.  We will now look at other escrow technology, as
 well as law enforcement and
export issues.  We are moving step-by-step towards new approaches.  The Clinton
 administration is moving ahead.

Subject: File 3--Beta-testers : EFF-Austin Law Enforcement Incidence Database

                        CALL FOR "BETA" TESTERS

             EFF-Austin Law Enforcement Incidence Database
                           January 24th, 1995


EFF-Austin is interested in creating and maintaining a database of
search and seizures involving BBS systems / Internet sites.

The intention of such a database is to:

* provide a status of recent incidences of government search and
  seizures.  A file is to be opened for each raid, and then tracked as
  it's case winds it's way through the legal system.  Ex: what is the last
  we heard about the Rusty N Edie BBS case?

* provide a historical record of past seizures.  People new to the Net,
  for example, need to know about the Steve Jackson Games case, and other
  important cases.

* track certain trends and trouble areas for civil libertarians, such as
  computers that are seized and never returned, people who are raided and
  never indicted, and the "downsizing" of draconian tactics, where those
  who are likely to cart stuff out the door are not the FBI, but rather
  state or local law enforcement.

* provide primary and secondary documentation sources for journalists,
  students, activists, law enforcement, and anyone else interested in
  these issues.

* track incidences that don't generate media coverage.


                      SCHEDULE FOR IMPLEMENTATION
                              (tentative)

February --     Beta-testing : fields, forms, and designing a database
                               application accessible via gopher/Web.
                               This is about six weeks.

March   --      Start data entry on huge backlog of cases. Initial
                estimate : 150 to 200 cases to-date.

        --      Public "un-veiling" during 1995 CFP.  Important to have
                a sizeable chunk done (50 to 70 or so). Also want to
                create a "Top 10 List" of important cases.


               WHAT WE NEED NOW IN TERMS OF BETA-TESTERS

We have taken an initial stab at designing a report format that we think
will cover all the bases, do what we want it to do, and be useful.

We want feedback from :

* People most likely to use the database (journalists, activists,
  students, law enforcement officials, lawyers, etc.) to examine the
  reports, make suggestions, and provide feedback on what information
  you would want from such a database.

* People experienced in designing databases accessible via the Internet.
  This should be accessible via gopher and the World Wide Web, though we
  haven't selected a database engine yet.

Since EFF-Austin is a non-profit, volunteer-run organization, we will
need assistance from the entire online community in order to make this
work.  Anyone is eligible to contribute input or participate; you don't
need to live in Austin or be a member of EFF-Austin.

Send e-mail to bladex@bga.com if you have any questions, comments, or
want to join the project.

I am concerned about the kinds of articles and books that get

Mr. Haden,

I saw your request for information reposted to an Internet mailing
list.  I have grown somewhat suspicious about such requests, given
of the terrible, yellow, sensationalist journalism about the net
that has been published in the last few months.

Before I begin to post challenges to your request, wherein I question
your morals, goals and motivations for requesting such information,
I thought I would offer you an opportunity to explain the thrust of
your work.

Perhaps I am wrong, but your questions look suspiciously like those
"answered" in works with similar titles in national magazines and
newspapers.

To be specific, do you plan to write more of the same "your children
are in danger of being brutalized by computer bulletin board
systems," of something different, better informed, and realistic (we
are, after all, talking about virtual reality and not FTF, physical
contact here).

That's funny, I'm writing a book called

    "Nearsighted and Dangerous:
     A Parents Guide to the Dangers of the Public Library"

I am seeking real events that are "public record" (either newspaper
articles or court documents) which involve the following criminal
activity:

1.) Sexual predators who have commited sex crimes on minors with a
    connection to a public library or salacious book.

2.) Teenage readers who have been charged with any type of plagiarism,
    copyright violation, document forgery, unauthorized access to
    private university libraries, or similar crimes.

3.) Any teenagers involved in making explosives with information
    obtained from a book.

4.) Any selling of illegal drugs involving minors and books available
    in libraries.

5.) Any other crimes involving teenagers as either victims or
    perpetrators with the use of public libraries or written documents
    of any sort.

Also would be interested in hearing from victims or perpetrators
willing to be interviewed "off the record", and/or willing to appear
on national talk shows.

If you have any such information please contact me.

Subject: File 6--Re: The InterNewt

Larry Mulcahy wrote concerning David Batterson's article:

> Why does this venemous screed deserve to be in CUD?  In it,
> Batterson only makes personal attacks against right wing
> figures, saying nothing about issues.

Funny, this is the same thought that came to my mind.  But I
considered the article more likely to be a lame attempt at poor humor,
rather than a series of genuine personal attacks.  So I let the matter
drop.  However, my feelings about the article are shared by others.
And, more importantly, perhaps these others don't see the humor
content.  Therefore, maybe this blatantly offensive series of
ramblings does deserve some response.

David Batterson wrote, for example, that "we can expect the clueless
Newtbies, chainsmoking Helmsmen and Rush dittohead dorks to increase
their invasion of the Net."  Now, I will reserve my personal opinions
regarding Newt Gingrich, Jesse Helms, and Rush Limbaugh -- and Rush
would probably be proud to make fun of David's article.  I'll also
fail to mention the obvious, that not every conservative is a
replicant of one of these men.

Nevertheless, if conservativism is what it claims to be, we should see
the current government get out of the way of the Internet.  Sometimes
this means that the government refuses to step in when it should, but
I think the Net is strong and organized enough so that this would not
be a danger.  In any case, subjects that have been recently most the
rave -- things like escrowed encryption, digital telephony, and
encryption export -- seem to cut across party boundaries.  If memory
serves, both democrats and republicans have taken both sides of these
issues.

Also, servers and newsgroups are already available for discussing
silly sectional interests in a variety of fields.  This is what we in
the Net call "free speech."  This necessarily means that some people
post ridiculous articles about the holocaust, for example.  But my
experiences have shown me that such silliness rarely leads to mass
conversion.  Why not?  Because "critics" also have access to the
Internet, and they can post a rebuttal to anything they feel requires
one.  So it is abundantly clear to me that there is no danger, even if
Jesse Helms does set up "a WWW home page for the tobacco industry,
where we can view video clips on the joys of smoking."

Thirdly, no congress, no matter how extreme, could possibly get away
with requiring free citizens "to learn some new terminology," even if
there is no "prison time for first time offenders who still use the
old meanings." Anyway, it's idiotic to think that such "new
terminology" would actually mock the government that created it!

You know, recently, when Conan O'Brien and Andy Richter did a similar
bit --Newt was giving the president commands that were patently absurd
-- it was funny.  I thought that, perhaps, it seemed funny because, in
the bit, Clinton was a willing subservient in this ridiculous
scenario.  But, then again, David Batterson's article in a way is just
as funny.  He has the whole of the world, embodied in the Internet,
being a willing subservient to such absurdities.  So perhaps it is
funny after all.

From: anthec@LIBERTYNET.ORG(Charlie Anthe)
Subject: File 7--CUD7.05, Article #2 (Newt Response)

        In his response to the critics of Newt Gingrinch found in CUD7.03,
Mr. Mulcahy cites as an example of Speaker Gingrich's dedication to the
voters the unveiling of the "Thomas" WWW server at the Library of Congress
earlier this year. The article provied goes to great pains to point out that
the server will provide the average voter with easy and instant access to
the daily activities of Congress and of the legislation being debated,
something that previously would have required enormous paperwork from the
Library of Congress.
        What is not mentioned by either the article of Mr. Mulcahy's
response is the fact that Speaker Gingrich probably had no influence
whatsoever in the installation of the Thomas server. Obviously a computer
system that was going to be unveiled to the entire nation and have such
politically important imformation on it would have begun in the planning
stages years ago, back when the Democrats were firmly in control of the
Congress. Mr. Gingrich is just being sure to soak up the limelight and
proclaiming the ideas and work of the Democrats as his own personal example
of the Republican fulfillment of their "Contract With America".

        While the creation of the Thomas server as well as that of the House
of Representatives own home page (available at http://www.house.gov) are
certainly important milestones in the advancement of information to the
public, let us not be so quick as to reward Mr. Gingrich with the fruits of
another group's labor.

          Critical Information about Unix /bin/mail Vulnerabilities

The /bin/mail utility on several Unix versions based on BSD 4.3 Unix contain
a security vulnerability.  The vulnerability is the result of race conditions
that exist during the delivery of messages to local users.  These race
conditions will allow intruders to create or modify files on the system,
resulting in privileged access to the system.

Below is a summary of systems known to be either vulnerable or not
vulnerable.  If your vendor's name is not listed, please contact the vendor
or CIAC for more information.

Patch Information
-----------------

DEC          The /bin/mail patch is a part of a comprehensive Security
             Enhanced Kit that addresses other security problems as well.
             This kit was released on May 17, 1994 and was described in
             DEC Security Advisory #0505 and CIAC Notes 94-03.

             OSF/1 users should upgrade to a minimum of version 2.0 and
             install Security Enhanced Kit CSCPAT_4061 v1.0.  Ultrix users
             should upgrade to at least version 4.4 and install Security
             Enhanced Kit CSCPAT_4060 v1.0.

             Both kits are available from your Digital support channel or
             electronically by request via DSNlink.


SCO          Vulnerabilities in SCO's /bin/mail utility are removed by
             applying SCO's Support Level Supplement (SLS) uod392a. It is
             available via anonymous FTP from ftp.sco.com in the /SLS
             directory:

Sun          Sun has made patches available to remove vulnerabilities in
             /bin/mail.  These patches address all vulnerabilities CIAC has
             seen exploited to date, and CIAC recommends they be installed.
             However, the patches will be updated again in the near future
             to remove additional vulnerabilities that have recently come
             to light.  CIAC will announce the availability of the new
             patches when they are released.

             The patches may be obtained from your local Sun Answer Center
             or through anonymous FTP from sunsolve1.sun.com in the
             /pub/patches directory:

             SunOS    Filename         MD5 Checksum

Alternative Solution
--------------------

For those sites unable to obtain a vendor patch for a vulnerable version of
/bin/mail, a replacement package called mail.local has been developed and
made freely available on the Internet.  The /bin/mail program is relatively
complex software, serving both as a mail delivery agent and a user interface,
allowing users to send and read E-mail messages.  Complex system software,
like /bin/mail, is more likely to exhibit security vulnerabilities.

The mail.local package was written to perform only one task: the delivery
of mail to local users.  It is comparatively small, and the code has been
examined carefully by experts in the security community.  While it has not
been formally evaluated, it is probable that mail.local addresses all
vulnerabilities currently being exploited in /bin/mail.

Subject: File 9--Re: Amateur Action BBS Update
Date: Sat, 21 Jan 95 14:47:43 PST

I have been keeping the net up on the AA BBS case since it started
last year.  Latest news (1/21/95) is that bail during appeal was
denied by the Sixth Circuit, and that Robert is to report to federal
prison Feb. 8, in Springfield, MO to serve 3 years, one month.  I have
no doubt that picking a place that far from his home and family was
done on purpose as part of the punishment.

Question for Mike Godwin:

Who pays transport from Springfield back to Utah so Robert can be
present for the bogus kiddy porn trial in a few months?  Also being in
prison will make it nearly impossible for him to prepare the .gif
files his lawyer wants to present in his defense.

They set the date (July 12) and place (Dublin, CA) for Carleen
(Robert's wife).  She is to serve 2 years, 2 months.  I think the
reason they are letting her start later is so she can be present when
their oldest son graduates from high school.

AA BBS is still up, and may well stay up for the whole time Robert is
in prison.  He has no other way to support his family or pay for legal
defense.  Also, outside of western TN, OK, Utah, and other backwards
places, what he is selling is legal--even protected under the First
Amendment.  (Though some of it *is* kinda gross :-) )

AA BBS is up to about 25,000 files.  There is a good chance that they
will be available through the internet at some point.

Trying to control information in the network age is about as sucessful
as pissing into the wind.

Our right to privacy is under concerted attack by authoritarians of every
political stripe. Under the twin rubrics of the "War On Drugs" and
"Stopping Child Pornography", the federal government in the United States
is moving to gut the U.S. Constitution's guarantee of the right to
privacy for every citizen.

We believe that working "through the system" is a hopeless waste of time.
This HyperBook is our effort to disseminate the vital information that
you need to insure your privacy in communications, computing, banking,

Subject: File 11--New Internet Virtual Democracy Software

           Short-Circuit for the Virtual Democracy Backlash

Those of little faith and traditional media who recently pandered to the
same fear mongering tactics they accused special interest groups of, once
again underestimated the sophistication and ingenuity of what they
were messing with.  "More hyper" ; ) Internet minds from Bittco
Solutions have released Co-motion Lite for Internet, virtual democracy
software that turns Internet connections into front row seats at
activist round tables.

Unplugged leaders can lose their fears about being "too plugged in"
and manipulated by "push-button voting."  "It compares to an
interactive survey," says Myrna Bittner from Bittco.  "In this case,
the surveyor puts out one question and decides who in the world gets
to participate, but after that participants can ask their own
questions, tell the stories behind their solutions and concerns,
interact with each other, and register their votes."  All of the
qualitative opinions are supported by quantitative results.  And,
every participant can print, analyze and distribute the results.

Bittco is countering the hyper-backlash by widely distributing client
applications free to Internet members interested in joining Keen
Minds, a group that tackles all types of topical issues.  MacintoshAE
versions are available immediately and a Windows81 version is in the
works.  Virtual democracy is now an undeniable reality on the
Internet.

You'll find Keen Minds in the Info-Mac archives.  The URL for the main
archive is at
ftp://ftp.sumex-aim.stanford.edu/info-mac/comm/tcp/keen-minds .hqx.
This site is mirrored to many locations throughout the world.  Contact
Bittco for a comprehensive list of locations, session times and topics
at 1-403-922-5514 or bittco@ccinet.ab.ca

Bittco Solutions develops and publishes innovative real-time groupware
for group decision support and collaborative brainstorming.  Bittco
also provides customized Internet solutions for collaborative
environments ranging from online activism to distributed customer
support.
