From: Metalhead <metal@MAGELLAN.CLOUDNET.COM>
Subject: File 2--ANNOUNCE: DEF CON ]I[ (Normal)

This is _not_ the professional sounding announcement.  Use that one to con
your boss / employers out of the cost of the trip.  The professional
announcement will be available on the FTP site and other more serious mailing
lists and news groups, etc.  This is the k-RaD kriminal shout out to all u
el1te hacker types that aren't in jail to attend 'da def con.  werd.

READ & DISTRIBUTE & READ & DISTRIBUTE & READ & DISTRIBUTE & READ & DISTRIBUTE
READ & DISTRIBUTE & READ & DISTRIBUTE & READ & DISTRIBUTE & READ & DISTRIBUTE

What's this?  This is an initial announcement and invitation to DEF CON III,
a convention for the "underground" elements of the computer culture.  We try
to target the (Fill in your favorite word here): Hackers, Phreaks, Hammies,
Virii Coders, Programmers, Crackers, Cyberpunk Wannabees, Civil Liberties
Groups, CypherPunks, Futurists, Artists, Criminally Insane, Hearing Impaired.

WHO:   You know who you are, you shady characters.
WHAT:  A convention for you to meet, party, and listen to some speeches
       that you would normally never get to hear from some k-rad people.
WHEN:  August 4, 5, 6 - 1995 (Speaking on the 5th and 6th)
WHERE: Las Vegas, Nevada @ The Tropicana Hotel

So you heard about DEF CON II, and want to hit part III?  You heard about the
parties, the info discussed, the bizarre atmosphere of Las Vegas and want to
check it out in person?  You want to do weird shit _away_ from the hotel
where you can't get me in trouble?  Then you're just the person to attend!

Sure it's great to meet and party with fellow hackers, but besides that we
try to provide information and speakers in a forum that can't be found at
other conferences.  While there is an initial concern that this is just
another excuse for the evil hackers to party and wreak havoc, it's just
not the case.  People come to DEF CON for information and for making
contacts.  We strive to distinguish this convention from others in that
respect.  Plus this year we have official DEF CON GOONS(c) who will pummel
you until you pass out should you cause problems for other con.friendly
people!  Big Brother loves you!

What's been said (Only the good stuff will be quoted, of course)

  Stevyn - "What can eye say, it was intense! . . . the whole con just
     kicked ass!  I totally recommend you check out the next one."

  Gail Thackeray, Prosecutor, "It's partly an entertaining party, it's
     partly a fashion statement.  But it's mostly something about which the
     business world has no clue."

  Wendy Murdock, Boardwatch, "Def Con represents the tug-of-war that has
     always been present - people strive to get that which is just out of
     reach, aggravating governments and breaking rules in the process."

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

WHERE IT IS:

The Tropicana has rooms reserved for the convention.  Rooms are expensive.
They are even more expensive if you don't book under the convention.  If it
is to expensive for you, please see the section below on Las Vegas WWW sites
that can provide you with information on other nearby hotels that are cheaper.
Check-in is 3 pm, check-out time is 12 noon.  Remember there is an 8% sales
tax in Vegas.

               65$ Single or Double room, Midweek (Monday - Thursday)
               90$ Single or Double room, Weekend (Friday - Sunday)
               350$ One-Bedroom Suite (Call for Availability)

     The Tropicana, 3801 Las Vegas Blvd. So., Las Vegas, Nevada, 89109
          (702) 739-2581 or (800) 468-9494 or (702) 739-2448 (Fax)

Held in three conference rooms at the Tropicana hotel in Las Vegas, DEF CON
promises to be interesting.  The Tropicana has a huge pool (largest in the
world?  Anyway, lots of cool movies have been filmed with this pool in them)
and in August Vegas should be about 100(f) degrees at one in the morning.
What do you care?  You'll be wired on caffeine and not sleeping anyway.  There
are numerous attractions in town from the strip bars to the local COs in case
you seek distraction.

The Tropicana is located right on the "Strip" with the other three corners of
the street occupied by the MGM Grand (Largest hotel in the world), the
Excalibur, and the Luxor (The big sense-net pyramid).  If you can afford it
I totally recommend spending some extra time in town.. there are too many
cool things to do, especially if you have never visited.  Heck, last time I
got to rent and fire uzi's and MP-5 machine guns (OK, so you can do that for
cRacK in Los Angeles) see some strippers, and drink 1$ bottles of imported
beer.  What a place!  Now you know why I chose Vegas for a location.

                                 SPECIAL EVENTS

and question a few answers, pile up the points  . . . and win big!

You know the game.  You know the rules.  Now all you have to do is have the
guts, get up on stage in front of your peers and the narks and show us all!

When?  After Dark Tangent's opening speech (which we're all really looking
forward to . . . [yawn]  HACKER JEOPARDY starts!

                         MIDNIGHT - DAY 1 of DEF CON (Friday)

If you wanna play . . . show up.  If you don't wanna play, show up.

There will be three rounds of three people.  Just like real. The winners of
each round will go into the Finals and the winner of that will win 25,000
units of some foreign currency!  From Dark Tangent himself!  Plus:

So, in the inimitable words of Al Bundy . . .  LET'S ROCK!


                       3rd ANNUAL SPOT THE FED CONTEST
                         Spot the fed, win the shirt

"Like a paranoid version of pin the tail on the donkey, the favorite sport
at this gathering of computer hackers and phone phreaks seems to be hunting
down real and imagined telephone security and Federal and local law
enforcement authorities who the attendees are certain are tracking their
every move.. .. Of course, they may be right."  John Markhoff, NYT

Basically the contest goes like this:  If you see some shady MB (Men in
Black) earphone penny loafer sunglass wearing Clint Eastwood to live and
die in L.A. type lurking about, point him out.  Just get my attention and
claim out loud you think you have spotted a fed.  The people around at the
time will then (I bet) start to discuss the possibility of whether or not a
real fed has been spotted.  Once enough people have decided that a fed has
been spotted, and the Identified Fed (I.F.) has had a say, and informal vote
takes place, and if enough people think it's a true fed, or fed wanna-be,
or other nefarious style character, you win a "I spotted the fed!" shirt,
and the I.F. gets an "I am the fed!" shirt.

Note to the feds:  This is all in good fun, and if you survive unmolested
and undetected, but would still secretly like an "I am the fed!" shirt to
wear around the office or when booting in doors, please contact me when no
one is looking and I will take your order(s).  Just think of all the looks
of awe you'll generate at work wearing this shirt while you file away all
the paperwork you'll have to generate over this convention.  I won't turn in
any feds who contact me, they have to be spotted by others.


             TELEPHONE CONFERENCE BRIDGE (801-855-3326)

For DEF CON III there will be a dial in conference set up.  If you are
overseas, or just too poor to make it to the convention this year, you can
still get an idea of what is going on and participate.  One part of the voice
conference equipment will allow you to listen to the convention room
microphone, another will allow you to ask questions during the Q&A sections
of peoples speeches.  A general conversation area will be up so you can chat
with others at the convention, or just others dialed into the bridge.
Navigate through the voice mail maze and get free phone sex!  Impress others!

The Voice bridge is up now at 801-855-3326.  It has 5 analog ports, but in a
few weeks will have eight digital ports for better sound, etc.

                     SPOOAH DOOPAH RAFFLE GIVE AWAY!@#

Throughout the convention, between speakers and events there will be a raffle
giveaway in which if your number is drawn, you win the prize.  Last year's
giveaway included an ancient kaypro monochrome portable, a roll of Sprint
"security" tape, "Computer Warriors" evil anti-virus cartoon, a 240 meg IDE
HD, and other elite things.

>> All the prizes given away are donated by other convention goers, so if <<
>> you have any stuff to give away, please save and donate it to the con! <<

                       RED BOX BUILDING CONTEST

While we don't encourage or condone the use of toll fraud devices, we do
encourage creativity and expression of thought.  We combine these and come
up with a red box creating contest.  The final device doesn't have to
produce the real red box tones (can't have people getting arrested) BUT it
does have to produce some audible tones, any kind of tones.  This contest
is inspired by last year's give away of a red box "Big Red" that looked just
like a big pack of Big Red gum, but really was a red box.  Elite!  There was
also a little girl's doll that was a red box, but the switch for that one was
hidden under the dress and, well, it just wasn't given away.

Come up with unique ideas!  With just a Hallmark card and some spare time you
can create an elite 007 style tone generating device!  What will you win if
yours is chosen as the most k-rad besides the envy of fellow hackers?  You'll
get a tee shirt and the cost of admission to the convention refunded PLUS
some as-of-yet undecided prize.  I bet you just can't wait to burn your
fingers with your soldering iron now!

                                THE VIDEO ROOM

In one of the rooms a LCD wall projector will be hooked up connected to a
VCR, and people can bring flicks to play.  Stuff like Max Headroom, War Games
etc.  You know, the cool cheesey stuff.  Also some "hacker" videos will be
shown.  If you have something you wanna show, bring it along.  When the
projector is needed in the main conference room it will be swiped for the
duration.

                                COOL VIDEO SHIT

At this time we are working to see if a T1 connection is possible.  If it is
there will be a cu-see me connection set up with multiple video cameras in
various locations.  Images will also be added automatically to a WWW page for
people to snag.  As all this works itself out there will be further
announcements.  No, there will be no "Hack our server" contests, and there
will be "Security Professionals" with "Diagnostic Tools" to "Correct" any
people who may cause the network problems.

                               SCAVENGER CONTEST

A scavenger contest is being planned.  The person or group with the most
number of items on the list wins the prize.  (Prize undetermined as of yet)
and there will be a few follow up prizes.  Don't forget to carry massive
amounts of water as you run about the concrete jungle, dehydration can
happen just crossing the street.  This is a contest for only the most k-rad.

                             WHAT YOU CAN DO TO HELP

DEF CON III will be planned right up until the last minute, with problems
being fixed and new things being added all along.. a sort of work in progress
that you get to witness in person when you show up.  Hopefully it won't be
too messed up when presented to the public.  What can you do to help?

=> Please help generate questions for Hacker Jeopardy.  Come up with some
   questions and answers, and Winn will decide which ones to use.  Mail 'em
   to winn@infowar.com.

- -> We are looking for people to speak on Personnel Information Gathering and
   selling.  Hopefully a speaker (who could remain anonymous) in this area
   has experiences in gathering and selling such information.  If you know
   of such a person, please invite them to contact me or let them know we
   are looking for such speakers.

- -> We are looking for some people to submit artwork to be used in the
   convention someplace.  It could be a poster, or in the program.  Black
   and white art would be eligible for the program only.

- -> Articles and interesting FTP sites, WWW pages, mini FAQs, etc. are all
   wanted for the program.  Quality articles that are informative and apply
   to the theme of the convention.  Scanner frequency lists,

                      WHY IS THE ANNOUNCEMENT SIGNED?

Well, last year it came to my attention that some unknown person in
California had modified an announcement and was having people mail their
pre-registration money to them instead.  It was actually pretty funny.  Only
one person was fooled and lost 10$.  Not bad.  I knew something was up when
he said he had pre-registered for 10$ and had the receipt I had supposedly
mailed back.  I am never that organized!  To avoid potential problems like
this one please verify this announcement!@#  My key is available for
verification on public key servers, and my key-id is 46A8294D.  The
other key you will find on servers may be my older 1284bit key, which is
still good, but just not used to sign this text.
