>From:

>To:
Homo Sapiens

Dear Infringing Species,

It has come to our attention that you have been utilizing anatomical
developments pioneered by several of our clients, the dinosaurs, in your
everyday activities.  This letter is to notify you that the dinosaurs
consider these features to be an infringement of dinosaur development,
which has been a documented fact in the scientific community for decades.
Said features are proprietary to the dinosaurs, and their duplication
represents a substantial harm to the saurian reputation and ability to
survive and thrive in a challenging evolutionary climate.
This letter is to formally advise you that the process of bipedal locomotion,
hereafter called "walking", is an activity the dinosaurs are prepared to
demonstrate that they have employed for thousands of years.  Continued
use of your legs for locomotion on land will be considered actionable.  In
addition, any evolutionary developments that you may have reason to believe
were first present in the dinosaurs must no longer be used by your species.
This includes all digestive and reproductive organs, and much of your
circulatory system.  The dinosaurs will vigorously defend their hard-won
evolutionary developments by any and all means available to them, including
but not limited to injunctive relief, monetary damages, and gobbling alive,
against all members of your species and any evolutionary descendants.
We trust that you fully understand the dinosaur position on this matter.

Sincerely,

BB/file

    Before you dismiss the imaginary letter above as completely without
relevance, consider the Bellcore letter to the editor of 2600 magazine that
was recently reprinted in these virtual pages.  Also consider the early
snarls from AT&T lawyers directed at the authors of the BSD NET2 software
distribution.  Those authors, you see, have written something much like the
UNIX operating system that AT&T markets, and have made the source code for
it available for one-tenth the cost of AT&T's version, and, in the case of
one version written specifically for the Intel 80386 processor, for free.
They have taken the first tentative bites out of the Thunder Lizard's food
supply, and the mad, unreasoning blood-lust that overcomes the dinosaur
at such moments cannot obscure the handwriting on the cave wall.  Of course,
the day of the dinosaurs was long gone by the time that our species first
trod upon the Earth...  but even in this day and age, a fossil living in a
museum can still get a good lawyer.  The Dead rise up, and are sworn in.
    It is a shame that the reputation for innovation that once was the
hallmark of AT&T and Bellcore has come to be so dominated by lawyers thriving
in at atmosphere of comparative technical innocence.  The quest for product
viability and excellence may not have been abandoned, but in some sectors
it has been supplanted by a desire to seal the product up in a black box:
A black box that can't be explained, examined, or improved upon... just
paid for in perpetuity.

They may not have proof of it, but the first time I heard about Busy
Line Verification was in '84 or '85 and there's at least one person I
knew in the computer underground at the time who I had reason to
believe when he said he'd used it.  Its existance is certainly no
secret to anyone who's messed around with the workings of the phone
system -- the codes that activate BLV were (and probably still are) a
sort of Holy Grail for telcom hackers.

Subject: File 3--Another View of Bellcore vs. 2600

    To many, the crux of the controversy seems to be whether or not
the internal Bellcore document was legally published in 2600 Magazine.
To me, the issue is one far more basic.

    Mr. Goldstein states that he published the article because it was
of "public importance".  But were there other goals as well?  To
embarrass Bellcore?  To protect the phone system from degradation
caused by inappropriate use?  Which goal or goals were the most
important?  In his response to Mr. Suchyta, he states that "...as
journalists, we have a certain obligation that cannot be cast
aside...".  What is that obligation?  Is "...readers, who have a keen
interest in this subject matter..." enough of a justification?  Or
should there be any justification?

    I believe that Bellcore should be allowed to discover, document
and correct the problem internally.  If Bellcore was negligent/refused
in correcting a known deficiency, that perhaps disclosure of the
problem would bring pressure to bear on Bellcore to correct the
deficiency.  But this was not the case.  Bellcore discovered,
documented and took steps to correct the problem it would seem, in a
timely manner.  Also, the problem that Bellcore documents does not
appear to be caused as the result of a deliberate, planned action to
provide for a "trapdoor".

    I would ask Mr. Goldstein:

        - did you verify the source of the document?

        - did you ascertain how the document was obtained?

        - did the document contain any markings indicating that it was an
           internal Bellcore document?

        - did you weigh the needs of publishing the article versus not
          publishing the article?

    I tried to apply an ethical code or standard that would govern MY
conduct if I was the person who published a similar article relating
to my profession.  I referred to the newly proposed revision to the
ACM Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct (CACM May '92).  I
concluded after review with my attorney that a disclosure of a similar
type by me would probably be in violation of the ACM Code sections 1.2
(Avoid harm to others), 1.5 (Honor property rights including
copyrights and patents - this also deals with unauthorized duplication
of materials), 4.1 (Uphold and promote the principals of this Code)
and possibly 2.3 (Know and respect existing laws pertaining to
professional work).

    This issue is not solely about computers and technology.  It is
about "doing the right thing".  It's about balancing the need for
information versus how that the information is obtained and
disseminated.  It's about having an ethical standard that treats
disclosure for the sake of disclosure and not ensuring that the
information is obtained in a method consistent with high ethical
standards as deserving of skepticism by the reader.

    There are those who liken this series of events to "Just one more
case of Goliath tromping on those ill equipped to defend themselves".
I would respond that if those who are "ill-equipped" to defend
themselves publish a document which may have been obtained in an
unethical manner and which may infringe on another party's rights,
then they should be prepared to face a possible challenge.  And as far
as "the chilling effect of their (Bellcore's) letter threatening to
trample on a free press as well", I would add that we not only need a
free press, but a free and RESPONSIBLE press as well.  The end does
not always justify the means.

    The First Amendment provides for certain guarantees of freedoms as
they relate to assembly, press and speech.  It does not unfortunately
guarantee common sense and a thorough review of all possible
reactions/results of exercising that freedom.  Many cloak themselves
in the First Amendment words - fewer still cloak themselves in ethical
standards that bring credibility to their work and to the causes that
they advocate.  The Computer Underground must win
respect/understanding in all phases of society or it will relegated to
a niche in that society.

Subject: File 4--New 2600 and 2600 Meetings

The summer issue of 2600 has been released. Subscribers should have it
no later than the early part of next week. Included within is the
latest on Bellcore's lawsuit threat against us, as well as a complete
guide to the different kinds of telephone signalling systems used
throughout the world (written by a real heavyweight in the phone
phreak world), a review of the Dutch demon dialer, a tutorial on
"portable hacking", tips on defeating call return (*69), a guide to
voice mail hacking, plus letters, news updates, revelations of an
interesting nature (more Bellcore stuff) plus a whole lot more.

On Friday, August 7th, we'll be having meetings in six American
cities. We expect all of these meetings to continue on a monthly
basis. Please spread the word. NEW YORK: Citicorp Center (between
Lexington and 3rd) downstairs in the lobby by the payphones. Payphone
numbers: 212-223-9011, 212-223-8927, 212-308-8044, 212-308-8162.
WASHINGTON DC: Pentagon City mall.  CHICAGO: Century Mall, 2828 Clark
St, lower level, by the payphones. Payphone numbers: 312-929-2695,
2875, 2685, 2994, 3287. ST. LOUIS: At the Galleria, Highway 40 and
Brentwood, lower level, food court area, by the theaters. LOS ANGELES:
At the Union Station, corner of Macy St. and Alameda. Inside main
entrance by bank of phones. Payphone numbers: 213-972-9358, 9388,
9506, 9519, 9520, 213-625-9923, 9924, 213-614-9849, 9872, 9918, 9926.
SAN FRANCISCO: 4 Embarcadero Plaza (inside).  Payphone numbers:
415-398-9803,4,5,6.

There is no agenda at a 2600 meeting, no formalities of any kind, no
dress code (except maybe in St. Louis), and no constraints other than
common sense. People generally get together, trade information, meet
people, look for feds, and do whatever else comes to mind (all
legally, of course).  Each meeting runs approximately from 5 pm to 8
pm local time on the first Friday of the month. Anyone wanting to
organize a meeting in another city should contact 2600 at our office:
(516) 751-2600.

Our voice mail system is now a voice bulletin board system every night
beginning at 11 pm Eastern time. You can reach it at 0700-751-2600
through AT&T. If you're using another long distance carrier, preface
that number with 10288.  It costs 15 cents a minute and all of the
money goes to AT&T.  Whoopee.

Permission is hereby granted to repost this message with the intention
of spreading news of the above.

Subject: File 5--Is Bellcore Guilty of Stealing Copyright Information?

I read about Bellcore's threat against 2600 and wondered why nobody
made the connection between Bellcore and the Secret Service raids in
1990.  The letter that Bellcore sent to 2600 was in that same petty
spirit.  Bellcore made some vague threats about an unidentified
article that may or may not have been a copyright violation.  This is
consistent with what they did a few years ago.

Bellcore's attempt to intimidate 2600 into silence sounds a bit like
the goring ox roaring even before it itself is gored.  Bell
Communications Research, known as Bellcore, employed Henry M.
Kluepfel as a security specialist and David Bauer, a R&D security
technoid.  Both have testified in hacker trials. Kluepfel was involved
in the Sun Devil and earlier investigations. He was on The Phoenix
Project bbs, where he routinely logged posts and sent them to the
Secret Service.  The posters held the copyright, and Kluepfel, a
private citizen, took them without authorization or permission.  These
were proprietary, and Bellcore, through its agent Henry Kluepfel,
clearly engaged in a conspiratorial scheme to obtain proprietary
information. Release of the information and subsequent use out of
context may be a criminal copyright infringement under 17 USC 506. Who
can ever forget how those posts were used by the Secret Service to
show that the claim that kermit is a 7-bit protocol is obvious
evidence of a conspiracy?  This led to the unjustified raid on Steve
Jackson Games.  Given the pattern of Bellcore's paid accomplice to
systematically, willfully, and knowingly engage in acts of obtaining
proprietary information, the RICO Act (18 USC 1962) might be fun to
invoke against Bellcore.

If Bellcore considers Emmanuel Goldstein guilty of obtaining
proprietary information, then I strongly suggest that the users of The
Phoenix Project have an equally valid claim that Bellcore was
responsible for stealing copyright material from users.  Maybe all
ex-Phoenix Project users should send Bellcore some letters. The
address listed on the letter to 2600 was

Leonard Charles Suchyta
LCC 2E-311
290 W. Mt. Pleasant Avenue
Livingston, NJ 07039

+++

((MODERATORS' COMMENT: The above poster refers to The Mentor's BBS,
known as The Phoenix Project.  Logs and other information taken from
TPP were instrumental in justifying the raid on Steve Jackson games.

In the Secret Service search affidavit for Steve Jackson Games, Henry
Kluepfel was listed as a "source of information." A substantial portion
of this information was derived from 17 messages of logs from The
Phoenix Project written from Jan. 23 through Jan. 29, 1990.  CuD #2.11
includes the complete affidavit and commentary.

The reference to a description of Kermit by The Mentor as evidence of
his participation in an encryption conspiracy read:

    >Name: The Mentor #1
    >Date: Fri Jan 26 10:11:23 1990
    >
    >Kermit is a 7-bit transfer protocol that is used to transfer
    >files to/from machines. It is mostly found on mainframes (it's a
    >standard command on VAX, for instance). Kermit has the added
    >advantage of being able to work through an outdial (because it is
    >7-bit).
    >
    >Mentor

We share the poster's concern with the action of Bellcore's Henry
Kluepfel. In that search affidavit, Timothy Foley wrote that Kluepfel
indicted that TPP's users' list contained the names of two "hackers"
from Illinois' Northern Federal District.  To the best of our
knowledge (and to the knowledge of those familiar with the users' list
during this period), the only two names on it from the Northern
District (former US prosecutor William J. Cook's jurisdiction) were
the CuD moderators.  Given the rather strange logic by which evidence
is fabricated by some prosecutors, perhaps Bellcore should first apply
to its own employees the same standards of integrity and honesty it
expects from others.

Because of his actions, Henry Kluepfel was named as a co-defendant in
a civil suit brought against him, Bill Cook, Timothy Foley, and
others, by Steve Jackson Games in 1991. The litigation, alleging civil
rights violations, is still pending.

Subject: File 6--Update on Len Rose

Len Rose was released from the federal penitentiary in South
Carolina in March after serving 10 months of a one year sentence
for unauthorized possession of Unix sourcecode. He completed the
remaining two months in a community release center in Chicago.
He is now working in Silicon Valley, and involved in some innovative
work. He is working on a project that involves feeding Usenet news and
Internet mail onto a satellite which basically provides a full news
and mail feed anywhere in continental US.

His wife and kids are still living in Chicago, and will hopefully be
able to join him soon. He is also doing consulting work in California,
so it looks like his life may be back on track.

When I recently spoke with Len, he said "... with the exception of my
financial condition, I am probably happier than I have ever been .."

He also mentioned that he is trying to contact everyone who ever
helped him , to say "Thanks" personally, so feel free to send mail to
him at:  "len@netsys.com" and he will get in touch with you.

Perhaps there are happy endings after all.

((MODERATORS' NOTE: Dr Ripco's status on 1 August 1992 is identical to
his status on May 8, 1990, the morning of the raid by the secret
service and others. Although never charged, and although there is to
date no evidence that he was involved in any criminal behavior, none
of his equipment has been returned, he has not been contacted by law
enforcement agents in over two years, he has not heard from attorneys
he believed were helping him in the return of his equipment, and he
has received no information about when, if ever, he can reclaim his
equipment. In short, he has no idea, nor has he been able to learn,
what's happening. Kafka's The Trial should be required reading for

Subject: File 10--CPSR Recommends NREN Privacy Principles

PRESS RELEASE
July 24, 1992

CPSR Recommends NREN Privacy Principles

WASHINGTON, DC -- Computer Professionals for Social Responsibility
(CPSR), a national public interest organization, has recommended
privacy guidelines for the nation's computer network.

At a hearing this week before the National Commission on Library and
Information Science, CPSR recommended a privacy policy for the
National Research and Education Network or "NREN." Marc Rotenberg,
Washington Director of CPSR, said "We hope this proposal will get the
ball rolling.  The failure to develop a good policy for the computer
network could be very costly in the long term."

The National Commission is currently reviewing comments for a report
to the Office of Science and Technology Policy on the future of the
NREN.

Mr. Rotenberg said there are several reasons that the Commission
should address the privacy issue.  "First, the move toward
commercialization of the network is certain to exacerbate privacy
concerns.  Second, current law does not do a very good job of
protecting computer messages.  Third, technology won't solve all the
problems."

The CPSR principles are (1) protect confidentiality, (2) identify
privacy implications in new services, (3) limit collection of personal
data, (4) restrict transfer of personal information,(5) do not charge
for routine privacy protection, (6) incorporate technical safeguards,
(7) develop appropriate security policies, and (8) create an
enforcement mechanism.

Professor David Flaherty, an expert in telecommunications privacy law,
said "The CPSR principles fit squarely in the middle of similar
efforts in other countries to promote network services.  This looks
like a good approach."

Evan Hendricks, the chair of the United States Privacy Council and
editor of Privacy Times, said that the United States is "behind the
curve" on privacy and needs to catch up with other countries who are
already developing privacy guidelines.  "The Europeans are racing
forward, and we've been left with dust on our face."

The CPSR privacy guidelines are similar to a set of principles
developed almost 20 years ago called The Code of Fair Information
practices.  The Code was developed by a government task force that
included policy makers, privacy experts, and computer scientists.  The
Code later became the basis of the United States Privacy Act.

Dr. Ronni Rosenberg, who has studied the role of computer scientists
in public policy, said that "Computer professionals have an important
role to play in privacy policy. The CPSR privacy guidelines are
another example of how scientists can contribute to public policy."
