Subject: File 1--"Internet users get a warning"

((MODERATORS' COMMENT: We've seen a number of media blurbs in the
past few weeks with headlines such as "HACKERS BREAK INTO THE
INTERNET." To readers (or politicians) with little understanding
of the Nets, the headlines and accompanying stories suggest imaes
of roving gangs lurking beneath every PC. The following comes from
the Lansing State Journal)).

WASHINGTON -- Users of the international computer network Internet are
being advised to change their passwords because of a rash of break-ins
to the system.

       Computer break-ins occur when an unauthorized user finds a way
to connect to a computer system, often using a stolen password.  Once
connected, they can read private information or change or eliminate
data belonging to others.

       "Intruders have already captured access information for tens of
thousands of systems across the Internet," said an advisory late
Thursday by the Computer Emergency Response Team, a federally funded
panel that helps coordinate interconnections among computer systems.

       In the short term, the advisory panel urged users to change
passwords.  But it said this is not a permanent solution and said that
the long-term solution lies in finding a way to eliminate reusable
passwords on the Internet.

Subject: File 2--Vice President Gore Questions Current Key Escrow Policy!

National Information Infrastructure Advisory Committee met today in
Washington at the Old Executive Office Building.  In comments made
after a question and answer period,  Vic President Al Gore said that
key escrow policy announced last Friday (2/4/94) had serious flaws and
that he hope the issue of who holds the keys and under what terms
would be given more serious, careful consideration.

Gore made it clear that some amount of control of cryptography
technology was necessary for national security.  However, the key
escrow policies announced by the Departments of Justice, Commerce &
State, and the NSA, were "low level decisions" that got out before
thorough analysis.  In a conversation with Mitchell Kapor, Esther
Dyson, and Mike Nelson (of the White House Staff), Gore said that he
would prefer that the keys be held by some part of the Judiciary
branch, or perhaps even by trusted, private escrow agents.  He made it
clear that he believed that the escrow agents named in last Friday's
announcement (National Institute of Standards & Technology and the
Treasure Department) were no appropriate key holders.  Mike Nelson
also indicated that there was real interest in a software-based escrow
system instead of the hardware-based SKIPJACK standard

Those of us who heard Gore were quite surprised.  His remarks suggest
that the key escrow policies to date do not have full support of the
White House.

Still, Gore was quite firm in asserting that some control of
encryption technology is essential to national security.  "Encryption
and codebreaking have determined the outcome of world wars.  He stated
(incorrectly) that most our industrialized allies place must stricter
controls in encryption that the US does.  In fact, almost all COCOM
countries allow the export of DES-based products, though some do not
allow DES to be imported.

The whole question of encryption was raised when Mitchell Kapor told
the Vice President that over half of the Advisory Council members had
serious reservations about the current Clipper/Skipjack policies.
Gore and Kapor agreed that the Advisory Council should be used to have
a serious dialogue about encryption policy.  Given Gore's departure
from the current Clipper proposals, there might actually be something
to talk about.

==========
NOTE: This DOES NOT mean that Clipper is going away.  Part of stopping
Clipper is to lift export controls on encryption and enable US
companies to start producing products that enable all of us to protect
our privacy with strong encryption.

                       Campaign Against Clipper
          CPSR ANNOUNCES CAMPAIGN TO OPPOSE CLIPPER PROPOSAL

Washington, DC -- Following the White House decision on Friday to
endorse a secret surveillance standard for the information highway,
Computer Professionals for Social Responsibility (CPSR) today announced
a national campaign to oppose the government plan.

The Clipper proposal, developed in secret by the National Security
Agency, is a technical standard that will make it easier for government
agents to wiretap the emerging data highway.

Industry groups, professional associations and civil liberties
organizations have expressed almost unanimous opposition to the plan
since it was first proposed in April 1993.

According to Marc Rotenberg, CPSR Washington director, the
Administration made a major blunder with Clipper.  "The public does not
like Clipper and will not accept it. This proposal is fatally flawed."

CPSR cited several problems with the Clipper plan:

o The technical standard is subject to misuse and compromise. It would
provide government agents with copies of the keys that protect
electronic communications.  "It is a nightmare for computer security,"
said CPSR Policy Analyst Dave Banisar.

o The underlying technology was developed in secret by the NSA, an
intelligence agency responsible for electronic eavesdropping, not
privacy protection. Congressional investigations in the 1970s disclosed
widespread NSA abuses, including the illegal interception of millions of
cables sent by American citizens.

o Computer security experts question the integrity of the technology.
Clipper was developed in secret and its specifications are classified.
CPSR has sued the government seeking public disclosure of the Clipper
scheme.

o NSA overstepped its legal authority in developing the standard.  A
1987 law explicitly limits the intelligence agency's power to set
standards for the nation's communications network.

o There is no evidence to support law enforcement's claims that new
technologies are hampering criminal investigations. CPSR recently forced
the release of FBI documents that show no such problems.

o The Administration ignored the overwhelming opposition of the general
public. When the Commerce Department solicited public comments on the
proposal last fall, hundreds of people opposed the plan while only a few
expressed support.

CPSR today announced four goals for its campaign to oppose the Clipper
initiative:

o First, to educate the public about the implications of the Clipper
proposal.

o Second, to encourage people to express their views on the Clipper
proposal, particularly through the computer network.

Toward that goal, CPSR has already begun an electronic petition on the
Internet computer network urging the President to withdraw the Clipper
proposal. In less than one week, the CPSR campaign has drawn thousands
of electronic mail messages expressing concern about Clipper. To sign
on, email clipper.petition@cpsr.org with the message "I oppose clipper"
in the body of the text.

o Third, to pursue litigation to force the public disclosure of
documents concerning the Clipper proposal and to test the legality of
the Department of Commerce's decision to endorse the plan.

o Fourth, to examine alternative approaches to Clipper.

Mr. Rotenberg said "We want the public to understand the full
implications of this plan.  Today it is only a few experts and industry
groups that understand the proposal.  But the consequences of Clipper
will touch everyone.  It will affect medical payments, cable television
service, and everything in between.

CPSR is a membership-based public interest organization.  For more
information about CPSR, send email to cpsr@cpsr.org or call 415 322
3778.  For more information about Clipper, check the CPSR Internet
library CPSR.ORG. FTP/WAIS/Gopher and listserv access are available.

The Electronic Frontier Foundation needs your help to ensure privacy rights!

                     * DISTRIBUTE WIDELY *

Monday, February 7th, 1994

From: Jerry Berman, Executive Director of EFF
      jberman@eff.org


Dear Friends on the Electronic Frontier,

I'm writing a personal letter to you because the time has now come for
action. On Friday, February 4, 1994, the Administration announced that it
plans to proceed on every front to make the Clipper Chip encryption scheme
a national standard, and to discourage the development and sale of
alternative powerful encryption technologies. If the government succeeds
in this effort, the resulting blow to individual freedom and privacy could
be immeasurable.

As you know, over the last three years, we at EFFhave worked to ensure
freedom and privacy on the Net. Now I'm writing to let you know about
something *you* can do to support freedom and privacy. *Please take a
moment to send e-mail to U.S. Rep. Maria Cantwell (cantwell@eff.org) to
show your support of H.R. 3627, her bill to liberalize export controls on
encryption software.* I believe this bill is critical to empowering
ordinary citizens to use strong encryption, as well as to ensuring that
the U.S. software industry remains competitive in world markets.

Here are some facts about the bill:

Rep. Cantwell introduced H.R. 3627 in the House of Representatives on
November 22, 1993.  H.R. 3627 would amend the Export Control Act to move
authority over the export of nonmilitary software with encryption
capabilities from the Secretary of State (where the intelligence community
traditionally has stalled such exports) to the Secretary of Commerce. The
bill would also invalidate the current license requirements for
nonmilitary software containing encryption capablities, unless there is
substantial evidence that the software will be diverted, modified or
re-exported to a military or terroristic end-use.

If this bill is passed, it will greatly increase the availability of
secure software for ordinary citizens. Currently, software developers do
not include strong encryption capabilities in their products, because the
State Department refuses to license for export any encryption technology
that the NSA can't decipher. Developing two products, one with less secure
exportable encryption, would lead to costly duplication of effort, so even
software developed for sale in this country doesn't offer maximum
security. There is also a legitimate concern that software companies will
simply set up branches outside of this country to avoid the export
restrictions, costing American jobs.

The lack of widespread commercial encryption products means that it will
be very easy for the federal government to set its own standard--the
Clipper Chip standard. As you may know, the government's Clipper Chip
initiative is designed to set an encryption standard where the government
holds the keys to our private conversations. Together with the Digital
Telephony bill, which is aimed at making our telephone and computer
networks "wiretap-friendly," the Clipper Chip marks a dramatic new effort
on the part of the government to prevent us from being able to engage in
truly private conversations.

We've been fighting Clipper Chip and Digital Telephony in the policy arena
and will continue to do so. But there's another way to fight those
initiatives, and that's to make sure that powerful alternative encryption
technologies are in the hands of any citizen who wants to use them. The
government hopes that, by pushing the Clipper Chip in every way short of
explicitly banning alternative technologies, it can limit your choices for
secure communications.

Here's what you can do:

I urge you to write to Rep. Cantwell today at cantwell@eff.org. In the
Subject header of your message, type "I support HR 3627." In the body of
your message, express your reasons for supporting the bill. EFF will
deliver printouts of all letters to Rep. Cantwell. With a strong showing
of support from the Net community, Rep. Cantwell can tell her colleagues
on Capitol Hill that encryption is not only an industry concern, but also
a grassroots issue. *Again: remember to put "I support HR 3627" in your
Subject header.*

This is the first step in a larger campaign to counter the efforts of
those who would restrict our ability to speak freely and with privacy.
Please stay tuned--we'll continue to inform you of things you can do to
promote the removal of restrictions on encryption.

In the meantime, you can make your voice heard--it's as easy as e-mail.
Write to cantwell@eff.org today.



Sincerely,

Jerry Berman

             Federal check on computer bulletin boards.
                   Financial Rev. Feb 4th Page 4

  Mounting evidence that computer bulletin boards were being used by
criminals, neo-Nazis and paedophiles has prompted a federal
investigation into their use.

  The Attorney-General, Mr. Lavarch, said he and the Minister for
communications, Mr. Lee, had agreed to set up a joint task force to
consider ways of regulating the use of computer bulletin boards.

  Mr. Lavarch said he was concerned that the bulletin boards - which
anyone with a home computer and modem could access - were being used
to disseminate "extremely offensive and often illegal material".

  "There is ample evidence that bulletin boards are being used to
distribute banned publications, including child pornography," he said
in a statement released yesterday.

  Although the Government has no idea how many Australians were
tapping into bulletin boards, according to industry submissions to the
Office of Film and Literature Classification, Australia was the
second-largest user after the US where an estimated 40,000 people
regularly used the boards.

  Mar Lavarch said in Amercia, paedophiles have been detected using
bulletin boards to contact each other and their victims.

  "Other examples of misuse include neo-Nazi propaganda dissemination,

unauthorized copying of software and other protected materials, sale
of stolen credit card numbers and the spread of other defamatory
information."

  He said it was time to look at ways to curb the growing misuse of
technology.

  "We are in an era where children operate computers as easily as
their parents rode bicycles.

  "We cannot allow advances in technology to overtake the legal and
law

enforcement measure designed to protect them, in particular, from
undesirable material."

  He said the issue of bulletin boards was on the agenda for the next
meeting of Federal, State and Territory censorship ministers in
Canberra on February 17 where the proposed new classification system
for over-the-counter video and computer games would be finalised.

Subject: File 7--Regulation of BBSes in Canada

     The CRTC (Canadian Radio & Television Comission) is the most
powerful government organization in Canada regarding radio,television,
telephone, and telecommunications service.  Recently, there have been
unconfirmed rumours abounding across Fidonet and some mailing lists
that the CRTC is looking at regulating computer bulletin boards as well.
A recent story on BBSes on one of our national television networks (CTV,
5/2/94) focused on the proliferation of 'pornographic BBSes' in Canada
in recent years, and the question naturally came up, "Should we regulate
computer BBSes?"  To the general public watching this, the response
probably would be "Yes!" after seeing the very great danger to the
moral fibre of this nation's youth <har!>.  An interview with the new
Minister of Communications, Mr. Jon Gerrard, on CBC Radio the same even-
ing did not discount the idea.  Mr. Gerrard evaded the pointed questions
quite nicely, and gave no answer one way or the other as to whether
regulation of BBSes was being considered.  As Minister of Communications
Mr. Gerrard is directly responsible for policy input into the CRTC, and
can direct the CRTC to new areas.  The recently-passed Telecommunication
Act of June, 1993 does not include computer networks (and BBSes specific
-ally) in its mandate, but their are clauses in the document that leave
regulation of areas not specified by the legislation to fall under
regulation at any future point, at the discretion of the CRTC.  As
to whether this is some nasty rumour or covert fact, none of us who
have been investigating the issue can find out.  Mr. Gerrard, however,
did release his e-mail address on the Saturday night CBC program, and
invited inputs from Canadians on this specific issue.  I would venture
to say that Americans should take interest in this issue as well. With
the II initiative in the U.S. heating up, escrow still remaining very
much a probabability in the Clinton administration, and the prolifera-
tion of BBSes and Freenets in both countries, the issue of increased
regulation of computer networks, especially at the more grassroots
level, is a very real possibility.  Along with regulation of the
medium, we can see a number of consequences here in Canada:  1) a
licensing fee of some kind, which hobbists presently running BBSes
may or may not be able to afford; 2) a definite limit as to what is
and what is not permissable to archive/disseminate/discuss on these
licensed boards; 3) those not adhering to licensing, would become, in
effect, 'pirate' boards, due to their non-registration, regardless of
content; 4) a general homongenization of the BBS scene: the rules
would be in favour of larger, more established (re: commercial) boards,
killing off small hobby boards, and limiting all BBSes content.

   I urge all Canadians and Americans to please respond to Mr. Gerrard.
Tell him from your perspective what you think the effects of regulation
of our media would be.  The more pressure we can place at earlier stages
of policy development, the more effect we can have on any policy.  Mr.
Gerrard's Internet e-mail address is

       Gerrard.jon@istc.ca

Please be polite and respectful.  Coming off as boorish and juvenile
will get this effort nowhere.  I am also archiving any files & info
that I cn on the subject on my BBS, RadioCityZen, here in Montreal.
All new users will have full access to all the file bases, and there
are no download ratios.  The files are contained in file SIG #27:
CRTC & BBS licensing.  Thanx for your time!  Anybody with new info
as things develop, please post to can.legal or alt.bbs.allsysop.

Subject: File 8--Pessimism in CuD (Response to Technological Disasters)

The anti-hype of your "A GUIDE TO TECHNOLOGICAL DISASTERS TO COME" in
CuD 6.13 is refreshing and much appreciated, but unfortunately your
pessimistic future is presented as a forgone conclusion rather than a
possible endpoint.  Perhaps that was rhetorically necessary, but there
are a couple things to keep in mind:

1) Numerous on-line commercial ventures were set up hoping to spoon
feed their customers with home-shopping and entertainment services,
but found that the inter-personal communication services that had been
tacked on as an afterthought were what people really wanted.  This
paints a different picture from your gloomy one of the slobby American
couch potato.

2) Changes in form can be accompanied by changes in content, in fact,
the _best_ time to change the structure of content, its quality
control and the incentives systems that produce it, is when form is
changing as well.  You might say that every political revolution is
doomed to failure because "the mediums may change but the content will
remain the same," but clearly this is not true.  Occasionally when an
old regime is overthrown the new form of government, enables an
entirely new kind of nation.

It is up to us to seize the day.

Subject: File 9--Response to "Technological Disasters"

In Cu Digest #6.13, A GUIDE TO TECHNOLOGICAL DISASTERS TO COME,
Kohntark (ktark@src4src.linet.org) says that the multimedia products
of the future, like the television of the present, will contain "the
usual fare of idiocy, sex and violence" and will be another way for
the corporate world and the government to "spoon-feed its citizens with
mindless, easy entertainment".

Goodness.  What cynically narrow view of the future.  Might as well
log off now.

Before we go, let's take a second to not lose sight of the trees from
the forest.  New technology will give us access to information we did
not have before.  Period.  Let's not worry about the emphasis being on
the entertainment side of the coin.  Talking about 500 channels and
on-demand movie rental is the only way business can sell multimedia to
its investors, stock holders, and to us the market.

Sure, there will always be tripe entertainment -- the "People"
magazine of the air-waves or fiber-lines.  Why?  Because there will
always be those of us who read/watch it.  The [entertainment] media is
not to blame.  You might say that they are being morally reprehensible
by *serving* the junk, but you can't say they are dictating it.  They
are just responding to the market.  We should not blame the
supermarket owner who provides donuts for the obese.

In the midst of all the crap -- maybe on the 475th channel -- next to
the 24hr/day Harding/Bobbit station -- there is going to be something
truly exciting -- truly educational.  A multimedia Discovery Channel
if you will.

I'm not going to comment on the ease-of-use problems possibly inherent
in future entertainment systems, except to point out that if they
*are* too complicated, no one will buy them.  This is a powerful
signal to the companies that will be making the stuff, don't you
think?

Also, let's not point the finger at big business and government like
they are some sort of *active* evil process.  They are not.  They both
are just responding (or trying to respond) to our wants and needs --
whether voiced or not.

And I'm not going to TOUCH what I think the root of our social
problems are and what the warning signs Kohntark mentioned really
indicate.

I will say that we must continually encourage all forms of new
technology -- entertainment or otherwise.  Because it just may be the
500 channel, on demand, 'Geraldo' episode super-vision system that
brings the $2/month, 100mb/sec digital fiber Internet line to our
doorsteps.

Subject: File 10--How to avoid Postal Entrapment (Re: CuD #6.11)

Several issues ago, you had an article about how to avoid getting caught
in a Post Office child porn trap.  I found the suggestions of the
writer valid, but unneccessarily risky.  I am an attorney who has done
some criminal defense work.

There is no way most of us are going to be careful enough to not open
a package that comes to us.  So--you have opened a package that
contains child porn, and you can feel the knock on the door coming any
minute.  I think you should immediately call 911 or the local
equivilant.  Tell the dispacher what you have, who it is from, and
request that the police come get it.

This does several things.  The most important is that you now have a
recording of your voice, telling the authorities about your horror at
having recieved such dreck.  Second, the locals might give the US Post
Office a hard time.

If you wait even an hour to call 911, then you risk the Feds picking
you up, leaving you with no record of how you were really trying to
take it back to the Post Office.

Do not worry about whether or not the package contains material which
is illegal locally.  You want to be ON RECORD as not wanting the
package, and you want this to happen as soon as possible.  The time
spent returning the package to the Post Office, or trying to get your
attorney on the phone, is time the Post Office can use to execute
their warrant.

I know this advice might tie up an emmergency line, but you have no
choice.  The police do not always tape record their other calls.  So
make your call short, and be sure to mention the package contents, and
the sender's name.   Be sure your roommates who may open your packages
are also told what to do.

Hope this advice saves an innocent (if anyone is truely an innocent
these days.)
