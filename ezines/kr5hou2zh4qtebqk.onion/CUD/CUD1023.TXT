Subject: File 1--Summary of Loudon County decision coverage

On Tuesday April 8th, Judge Brinkema released her first ruling on the
lawsuit against Loudon County for their filtering policy.  The actual trial
has not been scheduled but will happen later this summer.

Background : Loudon County has a policy only slightly more restrictive than
the Austin Public Library and has been sued by the People for the American
Way and Mainstream Loudon (on behalf of library patrons seeking access to
information) and the American Civil Liberties Union (on behalf of website
owners who wish to provide information to library patrons).

I've appended links to media coverage, statements, etc. that I could find.

   MEMORANDUM OPINION AND ORDER

   Before the Court are defendants' Motion to Dismiss the Individual
   Defendants and Motion to Dismiss for Failure to State a Claim or, in
   the Alternative, for Summary Judgment, in a case of first impression,
   involving the applicability of the First Amendment's free speech
   clause to public libraries, content-based restrictions on Internet
   access.

   I.  Background

   The plaintiffs in this case are an association, Mainstream Loudoun,
   and ten individual plaintiffs, all of whom are both members of
   Mainstream Loudoun and adult patrons of Loudoun County public
   libraries. Defendants are the Board of Trustees of the Loudoun County
   Public Library, five individual Board members, and Douglas Henderson,
   Loudoun County's Director of Library Services. (start page 2) The
   Loudoun County public library system has six branches and provides
   patrons with access to the Internet and the World Wide Web. Under
   state law, the "management and control" of this library system is
   vested in a Board of Trustees (the "Library Board"). See Va. Code Ann.
   '42.1-35. Library Board members are appointed by County officials and
   are not elected. See id. In addition to their management and control
   duties, Virginia Code '42.1-35 directs the Library Board to "adopt
   such bylaws, rules and regulations for their own guidance and for the
   government of the free public library system as may be expedient."

   On October 20, 1997, the Library Board voted to adopt a "Policy on
   Internet Sexual Harassment" (the "Policy"), which requires that
   "[s]ite-blocking software ... be installed on all [library] computers"
   so as to: "a. block child pornography and obscene material (hard core
   pornography)"; and "b. block material deemed Harmful to Juveniles
   under applicable Virginia statutes and legal precedents (soft core
   pornography)." To implement the Policy, the Library Board chose
   "X-Stop," a commercial software product intended to limit access to
   sites deemed to violate the Policy.

   Plaintiffs allege that the Policy impermissibly blocks their access to
   protected speech such as the Quaker Home Page, the Zero (start page 3)
   Population Growth website, and the site for the American Association
   of University Women-Maryland. Complaint 6696-105. They also claim that
   there are no clear criteria for blocking decisions and that defendants
   maintain an unblocking policy that unconstitutionally chills
   plaintiffs, receipt of constitutionally protected materials. Complaint
   6692, 95, 127-129.

   Based on the above allegations, plaintiffs bring this action under 42
   U.S.C. '1983 against the Library Board and against five individual
   Library Board members in both their personal and official capacities,
   and Director of Library Services Douglas Henderson in his official
   capacity. Plaintiffs allege that the Policy imposes an
   unconstitutional restriction on their right to access protected speech
   on the Internet, and seek declaratory and injunctive relief, as well
   as costs and attorneys' fees pursuant to 42 U.S.C. '1988. (FOOTNOTE 1)


   II.  Immunity Issues

   In their Motion to Dismiss the Individual Defendants, the (start page
   4) individual Library Board members (the "individual defendants")
   argue that they are entitled to absolute and qualified immunity and
   that suing them individually is redundant given plaintiffs, action
   against the Board itself.



     A.  Legislative Immunity



   The individual defendants argue that they are entitled to absolute
   immunity for their decision to adopt the Policy. As defendants point
   out, "[i]t is well established that federal, state, and regional
   legislators are entitled to absolute immunity from civil liability for
   their legislative activities." Bogan v.Scott-Harris, No. 96-1569, 1998
   WL 85313, at *2 (S. Ct. Mar. 3, 1998); see Lake Country Estates v.
   Tahoe Regional Planning Auth., 440 U.S. 391, 404 (1979). Legislative
   immunity bars not only actions for damages but also 91983 actions for
   declaratory and injunctive relief. See Supreme Ct. of Va. v. Consumers
   Union, 446 U.S. 719, 732 (1980). Such immunity applies both to the
   legislative body itself and to its individual members. See id. at
   733-34. Legislative immunity is premised on the notion that "a private
   civil action, whether for an injunction or damages, creates a
   distraction and forces (legislators) to divert their time, energy, and
   attention from their legislative tasks to defend the litigation."
   Eastland v. United States Serviceman's (start page 5) Fund, 421 U.S.
   491, 503 (1975).  The Supreme Court has also recognized that the
   threat of civil liability robs legislators of the courage necessary to
   legislate for the public good. See Tenney v. Brandhove, 341 U.S. 367,
   377 (1951); see also Lake Country, 391 U.S. at 405.

   This term, in Bogan, the Supreme Court explicitly extended absolute
   immunity to local government officials, finding that such officials
   "are likewise absolutely immune from suit under '1983 for their
   legislative activities." See Bogan, 1998 WL 85313, at *4; see also
   Bruce v. Riddle, 631 F.3d 272 (4th Cir. 1980) (finding legislative
   immunity for local legislators). Court held that city council members
   acted in a legislative capacity when they voted to adopt an ordinance
   eliminating the respondent's department, and were therefore entitled
   to absolute immunity. See id.

   Plaintiffs argue that Library Board members should not be entitled to
   legislative immunity because they are appointed rather than elected,
   and as such lack a direct electoral check on their actions. Plaintiffs
   rely heavily on Justice Marshall's dissent in Lake Country, in which
   he stated:



     To cloak [appointed] officials with absolute protection where
     control by the electorate is so attenuated subverts the very system
     of checks and balances that (start page 6) the doctrine of
     legislative privilege was designed to secure. Insulating appointed
     officials from liability, no matter how egregious their
     "legislative- misconduct, is unlikely to enhance the integrity of
     the legislative process.



   Lake Country, 440 U.S. at 407 (Marshall, J., dissenting).  The Supreme
   Court, however, rejected Justice Marshall's argument in both Lake
   Country and Boga in favor of a functional analysis of legislative
   immunity. See Lake Countr, 440 U.S. 391, 403-06 (granting legislative
   immunity to decisions of unelected regional body); Bogan, 1998 WL
   85313 at *6. Specifically, the Court explained in Bogan that
   legislative immunity was premised on the notion that "the exercise of
   legislative discretion should not be inhibited by judicial
   interference or distorted-by the fear of personal liability," and that
   this rationale applied equally to state, regional, and local
   legislators. Bogan, 1998 WL 85313 at *6; see also Bruce, 631 F.2d at
   277-80 (adopting functional analysis of Lake Country and finding that
   absolute immunity applied to legislative decisions of local
   officials). Based on this authority, we reject plaintiffs, argument.

   It is clear in this case that the Library Board's decision to adopt
   the Policy was legislative in nature.  Virginia Code '42.1-35 gives
   the Library Board legislative authority to create and adopt rules and
   bylaws for the governance of the library (start page 7) system, and
   the Policy was enacted pursuant to that authority. Moreover, the
   Policy is prospective in nature, and of general application. In
   contrast, the examples given by plaintiffs of non-legislative acts are
   individual and adjudicative in nature and do not pertain here. See
   Scott v. Greenville Co., 716 F.2d 1409, 1423 (4th Cir. 1983)
   (wrongful withholding of building permit); Front Royal & Warren County
   Indus. Park Corp. v. Town of Front Royal, Va., 865 F.2d 77, 79 (4th
   Cir. 1989) (withholding of sewer service). Like the City Council's
   adoption of an ordinance in Bogan, the Library Board's adoption of the
   Policy was essentially a discretionary exercise of rulemaking
   authority. As such, it is properly treated as legislative in nature.
   Accordingly, under Bogan, the Library Board and its members are
   entitled to absolute immunity for their decision to adopt the Policy.

   However, in addition to promulgating Library rules and regulations,
   the Library Board is also charged with the "management and control of
   [the] free public library system."  Va. Code Ann. '42.1-35. The
   Library Board therefore has a prominent role in enforcing the policy
   it has chosen to adopt.  Plaintiffs, allegations specifically target
   the Library Board's enforcement activities, in a section entitled
   "Implementation of (start page 8) the Policy." Complaint 670.  Indeed,
   one aspect of the Board's enforcement role, its choice of the
   filtering software used to block "pornography," is a central issue in
   the instant action.

   In Consumers Union, the Court held that the Virginia Supreme Court
   acted in a legislative capacity when it promulgated the Virginia Code
   of Professional Responsibility, and was therefore entitled to absolute
   immunity for its legislative decisions. See 446 U.S. at 734. However,
   the Court allowed a '1983 action for declaratory and injunctive relief
   to continue against the Virginia court because it found that the court
   also played a nonlegislative role in enforcing the Code. As such, the
   Virginia Supreme Court could properly be enjoined from enforcing the
   rules it had promulgated. Id. at 736. (FOOTNOTE 2) Following Consumer
   Union, we find that the Library Board and its members are not
   entitled to legislative immunity in their enforcement role. See id. at
   73436. Plaintiffs may therefore properly sue the Library Board and its
   individual members for declaratory and injunctive relief (start page
   9) under '1983 to prevent them from enforcing the Policy. (FOOTNOTE 3)
   See id.



     B.  Communications Decency Act Immunity



   Defendants also claim that they are immune from suit under section 509
   of the Telecommunications Act of 1996, now codified at 47 U.S.C. '230.
   Section 230 is entitled "Protection for private blocking and screening
   of offensive material," and provides at '230(c)(2) that:



     No provider or user of an interactive computer service shall be held
     liable on account of ... any action voluntarily taken in good faith
     to restrict access to or availability of material that the provider
     or user considers to be obscene, lewd, lascivious, filthy,
     excessively violent, harassing, or otherwise objectionable, whether
     or not such material is constitutionally protected.



   The Act defines "interactive computer service" to include "a service
   or system that provides access to the Internet [that is] offered by
   libraries or educational institutions." 47 U.S.C. '230(e)(2). Based on
   the above language, defendants argue that they are absolutely immune
   from suit for their decision to promulgate and enforce the Policy.

   (start page 10) Although defendants' interpretation of '230(a)(2) is
   facially attractive, it is not supported by that section's legislative
   history or relevant case law. At the beginning of '230, Congress
   states that "[i]t is the policy of the United States ... to preserve
   the vibrant and competitive free market that presently exists for the
   Internet and other interactive computer services, unfettered by
   federal or state regulation." 47 U.S.C. '230(b)(2). Interpreting '230,
   the Fourth Circuit has explained that:



     The purpose of ['230] statutory immunity is not difficult to
     discern. Congress recognized the threat that tort-based lawsuits
     pose to freedom of speech in the new and burgeoning Internet medium.
     The imposition of tort liability on service providers for the
     communications of others represented, for Congress, simply another
     form of intrusive government regulation of speech. Section 230 was
     enacted, in part, to maintain the robust nature of Internet
     communication and, accordingly, to keep government interference in
     the medium to a minimum.



   Zeran v. America Online Inc., 129 F.3d 327, 330 (4th Cir. 1997).  The
   Fourth Circuit went on to explain that "[a]nother important purpose of
   '230 was to encourage service providers to self-regulate the
   dissemination of offensive materials over their services." Id. at 331.
   Thus, as its name implies, '230 was enacted to minimize state
   regulation of Internet speech by encouraging private content providers
   to self-regulate against (start page 11) offensive material; '230 was
   not enacted to insulate government regulation of Internet speech from
   judicial review. Even if '230 were construed to apply to public
   libraries, defendants cite no authority to suggest that the
   "tort-based" immunity to "civil liability" described by '230 would bar
   the instant action, which is for declaratory and injunctive relief.
   See 47 U.S.C. '230(a)(2); Zeran, 129 F.3d at 330. We therefore hold
   that 47 U.S.C. '230 does not bar this action.



     C.  Eleventh Amendment Immunity



   Although the issue was not raised in the pleadings, at oral argument
   the parties raised the possibility that plaintiffs, suit might be
   barred by the Eleventh Amendment to the United States Constitution.
   The Eleventh Amendment bars federal claims against states and state
   officials for money damages and other retrospective relief. See
   Edelman v. Jordan, 415 U.S. 651, 66667 (1974); Republic-of Paraguay
   v. Allen, No. 96-2770, 1998 WL 19933 (4th Cir. Jan. 22, 1998).  "A
   state and its officers are not entitled to Eleventh Amendment
   protection, however, where a plaintiff seeks only prospective,
   injunctive relief." Gray v. Laws, 51 F.3d 426, 430 n.1 (4th Cir.
   1995); see Edelman, 415 U.S. at 664-68. The same is true for awards of
   costs and attorneys' fees made pursuant to 42 U.S.C. '1988. See Hutto
   v. Finney, 437 (start page 12) U.S. 678, 694 (1978). Accordingly, in
   the instant case, the Eleventh Amendment does not bar plaintiffs'
   '1983 action for declaratory and injunctive relief and attorneys' fees
   against the Library Board or its individual members.



     D.  Qualified Immunity



   In the alternative, the individual defendants argue that, promulgating
   and enforcing the Policy, they are entitled to qualified immunity
   against the present suit. Public officials are entitled to qualified
   immunity from liability for acts that do not "violate clearly
   established statutory or constitutional principles of which a
   reasonable person would have known." Harlow v. Fitzgerald, 457 U.S.
   800, 818 (1982). However, as defendants concede, qualified immunity
   does not apply to actions for prospective, injunctive relief like the
   one at issue here, see id. (qualified immunity shields public
   officials from civil damages liability), nor does it prevent an award
   of attorneys' fees pursuant to 42 U.S.C. '1988 against public
   officials acting in their official capacity. See Pulliam v. Allen, 466
   U.S. 522, 543-44 (1984). Therefore, given the relief sought by
   plaintiffs, the individual defendants are not entitled to qualified
   immunity for the promulgation and enforcement of the Policy.



     E.  The Real Party in Interest



   (start page 13) Finally, defendants argue that plaintiffs' suit
   against the individual defendants is redundant because the Library
   Board itself is already a party. We agree. As the Supreme Court has
   recognized, "official capacity suits generally represent only another
   way of pleading an action against an entity of which an officer is an
   agent." Monell v. Department of Soc. Servs., 436 U.S. 658, 690 n.55
   (1978). Here, plaintiffs' suit against the Library Board itself, if
   successful, will provide plaintiffs with full relief against
   enforcement of the Policy. Moreover, the nine-person Library Board
   appears to act only by the consensus decisions of its members. As
   such, plaintiffs, suit against the five Board members who voted to
   adopt the Policy is impractical as a means to enjoin the Library Board
   from enforcing the Policy. This Court therefore concludes that the
   individual Library Board members are unnecessary parties to this
   action and should be dismissed. Plaintiffs, suit against Douglas
   Henderson, Director of Library Services, is similarly unnecessary
   because Henderson is sued solely as a surrogate for the Board itself;
   moreover, a judgment against him cannot be expected to provide
   plaintiffs with complete relief against enforcement of the Policy.
   Accordingly, he will be dismissed as well.

   III.  Standing

   (start page 13) Defendants argue that plaintiffs lack standing to
   pursue this action because neither the individual plaintiffs nor
   Mainstream Loudoun have suffered an actual injury as a result of the
   Policy. Specifically, defendants allege that no member of Mainstream
   Loudoun has attempted to access blocked Internet materials in Loudoun
   County libraries, or petitioned a library to unblock a blocked site.
   An association has standing to sue on behalf of its members when: "(1)
   its own members would have standing to sue in their own right; (2) the
   interests the organization seeks to protect are germane to the
   organization's purpose; and (3) neither the claim nor the relief
   sought requires the participation of the individual members in the
   lawsuit." Maryland Highways Contractors v. Maryland, 933 F.2d 1246,
   1250 (4th Cir. 1991); see Hunt v. Washington State Apple Adver.
   Comm'n, 432 U.S. 333, 343 (1977). Defendants contend that the first
   requirement is not met here because none of the individual plaintiffs
   has alleged the actual injury necessary to sue on his own behalf.

   Defendants' argument is contradicted by plaintiffs, Complaint, which
   alleges that several Mainstream Loudoun members have attempted to
   access Internet publications at Loudoun County libraries but
   discovered that the sites had been blocked. See (start page 15)
   Complaint 6619, 20, 23. In evaluating a motion to dismiss the Court
   must treat the allegations in plaintiffs' Complaint as true. See
   Scheur v. Rhodes, 416 U.S. 232, 236 (1974). Because these plaintiffs
   have alleged that their access to particular Internet sites was
   blocked pursuant to the Policy, their claims survive dismissal.

   Defendants also allege that no individual plaintiff Claims to have
   requested that a site be unblocked and had that Request denied;
   however, we find that no such allegation is necessary to confer
   standing. See Lamont v. Postmaster General, 381 U.S. 301 (1943). In
   Lamont, the plaintiff sued to invalidate a federal statute that
   directed the Postmaster General not,. to deliver a publication deemed
   "communist propaganda" without a written request from the plaintiff.
   See id. at 302-04. Plaintiff refused to make such a written request,
   claiming that the requirement imposed an unconstitutional burden on
   his First Amendment right to receive protected speech. See id. at
   304-O5.  Despite plaintiff's refusal to seek access to restricted
   materials, the Supreme Court allowed him to maintain his First
   Amendment claim. See id. In accordance with Lamont, the plaintiffs in
   this case need not allege that they actually requested that a
   particular site be unblocked. Instead, (start page 16) plaintiffs need
   only allege that they were unable to access otherwise protected
   materials as a result of the Policy. Because the Complaint contains
   such allegations, the first requirement of Maryland Highways
   Contractors is satisfied here. See 933 F.2d at 1250.

   Defendants also allege that Mainstream Loudoun does not satisfy the
   third requirement of Maryland Highways Contractors because the
   interests of individual members may be in conflict with Mainstream
   Loudoun's interest in pursuing this action. The Fourth Circuit has
   held that associations lack standing where "there are actual conflicts
   of interest which would require that the individual members come into
   the lawsuit to protect their interests." Id. at 1252-53. As evidence
   of an actual conflict, defendants point to Mainstream Loudoun's
   allegation that: "We reflect countless races, religions and
   lifestyles, and we often differ on questions of morality and
   behavior." Complaint 612.  However, defendants ignore Mainstream
   Loudoun's additional claim that its unifying goal is "to ensur[e] a
   free and open society that preserves religious and personal freedom as
   established by the U.S. Constitution." Complaint 612. That Mainstream
   Loudoun has a diverse membership does not, by itself, demonstrate the
   existence of an actual conflict of interest in this case.  (start page
   17) Moreover, plaintiffs have alleged that a judgment invalidating the
   Policy will completely satisfy the interests of the association's
   members. As such, Mainstream Loudoun appears to satisfy all of the
   elements needed to have standing. For these reasons, Mainstream
   Loudoun will not be dismissed from this action.

   Finally, defendants correctly note that several plaintiffs fail to
   allege that they ever attempted to access an Internet site blocked
   pursuant to the Policy. See Complaint 6615-18, 21 22, 24-25
   (plaintiffs Judy Coughlin, Henry Taylor, Ann Curley, Judith Hines,
   Kathryn Kern-Levine, Michael Clay, Jerome Smith, and Mary Adams).
   Without that allegation, these individual plaintiffs cannot claim that
   they were ever denied access to constitutionally protected speech. As
   such, they have not alleged an actual injury sufficient to maintain
   standing. See Northeastern Fla. Contractors v. Jacksonville, 508 U.S.
   656, 663 (1993). These individual plaintiffs must therefore be
   dismissed from this action.

   IV.  Plaintiffs' First Amendment Claim

   In their Motion to Dismiss for Failure to State a Claim, or, in the
   Alternative, for Summary Judgment, defendants concede that the Policy
   prohibits access to speech on the basis of its (start page 18)
   content. See Def. Brief at 11. However, defendants argue that the
   "First Amendment does not in any way limit the decisions of a public
   library on whether to provide access to information on the Internet."
   Def. Brief at 2. Indeed, at oral argument, defendants went so far as
   to claim that a public library could constitutionally prohibit access
   to speech simply because it was authored by African-Americans, or
   because it espoused a particular political viewpoint, for example
   pro-Republican. Feb. 27, 1998 Hearing Transcript at 48. Thus, the
   central question before this Court is whether a public library may,
   without violating the First Amendment, enforce content-based
   restrictions on access to Internet speech.

   No cases directly address this issue. However, the parties agree that
   the most analogous authority on this issue is Board of Education v.
   Pico, 457 U.S. 853 (1982), in which the Supreme Court reviewed the
   decision of a local board of education to remove certain books from a
   high school library based on the board's belief that the books were
   "anti-American, anti-Christian, anti-Sem[i]tic, and just plain
   filthy." Id. at 856. The Second Circuit had reversed the district
   court's grant of summary judgment to the school board on plaintiff's
   First Amendment claim. A sharply-divided Court voted to affirm the
   (start page 19) Court of Appeal's decision to remand the case for a
   Determination of the school board's motives. However, the Court did
   not render a majority opinion. Justice Brennan, joined by three
   Justices, wrote what is commonly referred to as the "plurality"
   opinion. Justice Brennan held that the First Amendment necessarily
   limits the government's right to remove materials on the basis of
   their content from a high school library. See id. at 864-69 (plurality
   op.). Justice Brennan reasoned that the right to receive information
   is inherent in the right to speak and that "the State may not,
   consistently with the spirit of the First Amendment, contract the
   spectrum of available knowledge." Id. at 866 (quoting Griswold v.
   Connecticut, 381 U.S. 479, 482 (1965)); see also Stanley v. Georgia,
   394 U.S. 557, 564 (1969) ("the Constitution protects the right to
   receive information and ideas"). Justice Brennan explained that this
   principle was particularly important given the special role of the
   school's library as a locus for free and independent inquiry. See id.
   at 869. At the same time, Justice Brennan recognized that public high
   schools play a crucial inculcative role in "the preparation of
   individuals for participation as citizens" and are therefore entitled
   to great discretion "to establish and apply their curriculum in such a
   way as to transmit community values." Id. (start page 20) at 863-64
   (quoting Ambach v. Norwick, 441 U.S. 68, 76-77 (1979) (internal
   quotation marks omitted)). Accordingly, Justice Brennan held that the
   school board members could not remove books "simply because they
   dislike the ideas contained [in them]," thereby "prescrib[ing] what
   shall be orthodox in politics, nationalism, religion, or other matters
   of opinion," but that the board might remove books for reasons of
   educational suitability, for example pervasive vulgarity. Id. at 872
   (quoting West Va. Bd. of Educ. v. Barnette, 319 U.S. 624, 642 (1943))
   (internal quotation marks omitted).

   In a concurring opinion, Justice Blackmun focused not on the right to
   receive information recognized by the plurality, but on the school
   board's discrimination against disfavored ideas. Justice Blackmun
   explicitly recognized that Pico's facts invoked two significant,
   competing interests: the inculcative mission of public high schools
   and the First Amendment's core proscription against content-based
   regulation of speech. See id. at 876-79 (Blackmun, J., concurring).
   Justice Blackmun noted that the State must normally demonstrate a
   compelling reason for content based regulation, but that a more
   limited form of protection should apply in the context of public high
   schools. See id. At 877-78. Balancing the two principles above,
   Justice Blackmun (start page 21) agreed with the plurality that the
   school board. could not remove books based on mere disapproval of
   their content but could limit its collection for reasons of
   educational suitability or budgetary constraint. See id. at 879.

   Dissenting, Chief Justice Burger, joined by three Justices, concluded
   that any First Amendment right to receive speech did not affirmatively
   obligate the government to provide such speech in high school
   libraries. See id. at 888 (Burger, C.J., dissenting). Chief Justice
   Burger reasoned that although the State could not constitutionally
   prohibit a speaker from reaching an intended audience, nothing in the
   First Amendment requires public high schools to act as a conduit for
   particular speech. See id. at 885-89. Chief Justice Burger explained
   that such an obligation would be inconsistent with public high
   schools, inculcative mission, which necessarily requires schools to
   make content-based choices among competing ideas in order to establish
   a curriculum and educate students. See id. at 889.

   Defendants contend that the Pico plurality opinion has no application
   to this case because it addressed only decisions to remove materials
   from libraries and specifically declined to address library decisions
   to acquire materials. See id. at 861 63, 871-72 (plurality op.).
   Defendants liken the Internet to a (start page 22) vast Interlibrary
   Loan system, and contend that restricting Internet access to selected
   materials is merely a decision not to acquire such materials rather
   than a decision to remove them from a library's collection. As such,
   defendants argue, the instant case is outside the scope of the Pico
   plurality.

   In response, plaintiffs argue that, unlike a library's collection of
   individual books, the Internet is a "single, integrated system." Pl.
   Brief at 14 (quoting ACLU v, Reno, 929 F. Supp. 824, 838 (E.D. Pa.
   1996), aff'd, 117 S. Ct. 2329 (1997). As plaintiffs explain, "[t]hough
   information on the Web is contained in individual computers, the fact
   that each of these computers is connected to the Internet through
   [World Wide Web] protocols allows all of the information to become
   part of a single body of knowledge." Pl. Brief at 15 (quoting Reno,
   929 F. Supp. at 836). Accordingly, plaintiffs analogize the Internet
   to a set of encyclopedias, and the Library Board's enactment of the
   Policy to a decision to "black out" selected articles considered
   inappropriate for adult and juvenile patrons.

   After considering both arguments, we conclude that defendants have
   misconstrued the nature of the Internet. By purchasing Internet
   access, each Loudoun library has made all Internet publications
   instantly accessible to its patrons. (start page 23) Unlike an
   Interlibrary loan or outright book purchase, no appreciable
   expenditure of library time or resources is required to make a
   particular Internet publication available to a library patron. In
   contrast, a library must actually expend resources to restrict
   Internet access to a publication that is otherwise immediately
   available. In effect, by purchasing one such publication, the library
   has purchased them all. The Internet therefore more closely resembles
   plaintiffs' analogy of a collection of encyclopedias from which
   defendants have laboriously redacted portions deemed unfit for library
   patrons. As such, the Library Board's action is more appropriately
   characterized as a removal decision. We therefore conclude that the
   principles discussed in the Pico plurality are relevant and apply to
   the Library Board's decision to promulgate and enforce the Policy.

   Plaintiffs also contend that the plurality's decision in Pico
   establishes a blanket rule that removal decisions by libraries may not
   be resolved on summary judgment. We find plaintiffs, reading of Pico
   to be oversimplistic. It is true that a majority of the Pico Court
   voted to remand the case for a determination of the school board's
   motives, impliedly rejecting the unfettered discretion defendants
   claim. See id. at 875. At (start page 24) the same time, however, a
   majority of the Court could not agree on the degree of discretion
   available to school libraries. See id. at 856 (plurality op.); 875
   (Blackmun, J., concurring); cf. id. at 883 (White, J., concurring).
   Nor did any of the Pico Justices directly address the special
   circumstances that obtain in public libraries. It would therefore be
   inappropriate for this Court to deny defendants' motion without first
   determining the scope of discretion available to the Library Board to
   remove materials on the basis of their content.

   Defendants argue that any limitation on their discretion to remove
   materials would force them to act as an unwilling conduit of
   information, and urge this Court to adopt the position of the Pico
   dissent. Defendants interpret the dissent to mean that they are
   entitled to unfettered discretion in deciding what materials to make
   available to library patrons.

   Adopting defendants, position, however, would require this Court to
   ignore the Pico plurality's decision to remand the case, as discussed
   above. Moreover, all of the Pico Justices, including the dissenters,
   recognized that any discretion accorded to school libraries was
   uniquely tied to the public school's role as educator. See id. at
   863-64, 869-71 (plurality op.); 875-76, 879 (Blackmun, J., concurring)
   ("Certainly, the unique (start page 25) environment of the school
   places substantial limits on the extent to which official decisions
   may be restrained by First Amendment values."); cf. id. at 889-92
   (Burger, C.J., dissenting) ("Whatever role the government might play
   as a conduit of information, schools in particular ought not be made a
   slavish courier of the material of third parties ... . How are
   'fundamental values, to be inculcated except by having school boards
   make content-based decisions about the appropriateness of retaining
   materials in the school library and curriculum[?]"); 909-10
   (Rehnquist, J., dissenting) ("When it acts as an educator ... the
   government is engaged in inculcating social values and knowledge in
   relatively impressionable young people . In short, actions by the
   government as educator do not raise the same First Amendment concerns
   as actions by the government as sovereign."); 921 (O'Connor, J.,
   dissenting) (stating that "in this case the government is acting in
   its special role as educator"). of even more significance to our case
   is Justice Rehnquist's observation that high school libraries must be
   treated differently from public libraries. See id. at 915 (Rehnquist,
   J., dissenting) ("Unlike university or public libraries, elementary
   and secondary school libraries are not designed for freewheeling
   inquiry."). Indeed, Chief Justice (start page 26) Burger and Justice
   Rehnquist justified giving public schools broad discretion to remove
   books in part by noting that such materials remained available in
   public libraries. See id. at 892 (Burger, C.J., dissenting) ("Books
   may be acquired from ... public libraries, or other alternative
   sources unconnected with the unique environment of the local public
   schools."); 915 (Rehnquist, J., dissenting)("[T]he most obvious reason
   that petitioners' removal of the books did not violate respondents'
   right to receive information is the ready availability of the books
   elsewhere. ... The books may be borrowed from a public library.").
   Accordingly, neither the dissent nor the plurality of Pico can be said
   to support defendants' argument that public libraries enjoy unfettered
   discretion to remove materials from their collections.

   To the extent that Pico applies to this case, we conclude that it
   stands for the proposition that the First Amendment applies to, and
   limits, the discretion of a public library to place content-based
   restrictions on access to constitutionally protected materials within
   its collection. Consistent with the mandate of the First Amendment, a
   public library, "like other enterprises operated by the State, may not
   be run in such a manner as to 'prescribe what shall be orthodox in
   politics, (start page 27) nationalism, religion, or other matters of
   opinion."' Id. at 876 (Blackmun, J., concurring) (quoting Barnette,
   319 U.S. at 642).

   Furthermore, the factors which justified giving high school libraries
   broad discretion to remove materials in Pico are not present in this
   case. The plaintiffs in this case are adults rather than children.
   Children, whose minds and values are still developing, have
   traditionally been afforded less First Amendment protection,
   particularly within the context of public high schools. See Tinker v.
   Des Moines Sch. Dist., 393 U.S. 503, 506 (1969). In contrast, adults
   are deemed to have acquired the maturity needed to participate fully
   in a democratic society, and their right to speak and receive speech
   is entitled to full First Amendment protection. Accordingly, adults
   are entitled to receive categories of speech, for example "pervasively
   vulgar" speech, which may be inappropriate for children. See Reno v.
   ACLU, 117 S. Ct. 2329, 2346 (1997); Sable Communications v. FCC, 492
   U.S. 115, 126 (1989).

   More importantly, the tension Justice Blackmun recognized between the
   inculcative role of high schools and the First Amendment's prohibition
   on content-based regulation of speech does not exist here. See Pico,
   457 U.S. at 876-80 (Blackmun, J., concurring). Public libraries lack
   the inculcative mission that (start page 28) is the guiding purpose of
   public high schools. Instead, public libraries are places of
   freewheeling and independent inquiry. See id. at 914 (Rehnquist, J.,
   dissenting). Adult library patrons are presumed to have acquired
   already the "fundamental values" needed to act as citizens, and have
   come to the library to pursue their personal intellectual interests
   rather than the curriculum of a high school classroom. As such, no
   curricular motive justifies a public library's decision to restrict
   access to Internet materials on the basis of their content.

   Finally, the unique advantages of Internet speech eliminate any
   resource-related rationale libraries might otherwise have for engaging
   in content-based discrimination. The Supreme Court has analogized the
   Internet to a "vast library including millions of readily available
   and indexed publications," the content of which "is as diverse as
   human thought." Reno, 117 S. Ct. at 2335. Unlike more traditional
   libraries, however, there is no marginal cost associated with
   acquiring Internet publications. Instead, all, or nearly all, Internet
   publications are jointly available for a single price. Indeed, it
   costs a library more to restrict the content of its collection by
   means of blocking software than it does for the library to offer
   unrestricted access to all Internet publications. Nor do Internet
   publications, which exist (start page 29) only in "cyberspace," take
   up shelf space or require physical maintenance of any kind.
   Accordingly, considerations of cost or physical resources cannot
   justify a public library's decision to restrict access to Internet
   materials. Cf. Pico, 457 U.S. at 909 (Rehnquist, J., dissenting)
   (budgetary considerations force schools to choose some books over
   others); 879 n.1 (Blackmun, J., concurring) (same).

   In sum, there is "no basis for qualifying the level of First Amendment
   scrutiny" that must be applied to a public library's decision to
   restrict access to Internet publications. Reno, 117 S. Ct. at 2344. We
   are therefore left with the First Amendment's central tenet that
   content-based restrictions on speech must be justified by a compelling
   governmental interest and must be narrowly tailored to achieve that
   end. See Simon & Schuster, Inc. v. Members of the N.Y. State Crime
   Victims Bd., 502 U.S. 105, 118 (1991). This principle was recently
   affirmed within the context of Internet speech. See Reno, 117 S. Ct.
   at 2343-48. Accordingly, we hold that the Library Board may not adopt
   and enforce content-based restrictions on access to protected Internet
   speech absent a compelling state interest and means narrowly drawn to
   achieve that end.

   This holding does not obligate defendants to act as (start page 30)
   unwilling conduits of information, because the Library Board need not
   provide access to the Internet at all. Having chosen to provide
   access, however, the Library Board may not thereafter selectively
   restrict certain categories of Internet speech because it disfavors
   their content. In accord with this holding is Lamont, discussed supra,
   in which the Court held that the Post office could not
   constitutionally restrict access to speech it considered "communist
   propaganda," stating that "'[t]he United States may give up the
   post-office when it sees fit, but while it carries it on the use of
   the mails is almost as much a part of free speech as the right to use
   our tongues.'" Lamont, 381 U.S. at 305 (quoting Milwaukee Soc. Dem.
   Pub. Co. v. Burleson, 255 U.S. 407, 437 (1921) (Holmes, J.,
   dissenting)); see id. at 310 ("If the Government wishes to withdraw a
   subsidy or a privilege, it must do so by means and on terms which do
   not endanger First Amendment rights.") (Brennan, J., concurring).
   Similarly, in this case, the Library Board need not offer Internet
   access, but, having chosen to provide it, must operate the service
   within the confines of the First Amendment.



     A. Obscenity, Child Pornography and Speech "Harmful to Juveniles"



   Having determined that a public library must satisfy strict (start
   page 31) scrutiny before it may engage in content-based regulation of
   protected speech, we now consider the speech regulated by the Policy.
   The Policy prohibits access to three types of speech: obscenity, child
   pornography, and materials deemed "[h]armful to [j]uveniles."
   Complaint Ex. 1. obscenity and child pornography are not entitled to
   the protections of the First Amendment, and the government may
   legitimately restrict access to such materials. See New York v.
   Ferber, 458 U.S. 747 (1982) (child pornography); Miller v.
   California, 413 U.S. 15 (1973) (obscenity). Indeed, [t]ransmitting
   obscenity and child pornography, whether via the Internet or other
   means, is already illegal under federal law for both adults and
   juveniles." Reno, 117 S. Ct. at 2348 n.44. In the instant case,
   however, plaintiffs allege that the X-Stop filtering software chosen
   by defendants restricts many publications which are not obscene or
   pornographic, including materials unrelated to sex altogether, such as
   the Quaker's website. See Complaint 696-105. Moreover, plaintiffs
   allege that X-Stop fails to block access to pornographic materials
   arguably covered by the Policy. See Complaint 6127. most importantly,
   plaintiffs allege that the decision as to which materials to block is
   made by a California corporation based on secret criteria not
   disclosed even to (start page 32) defendants, criteria which may or
   may not bear any relation to legal definitions of obscenity or child
   pornography. See Complaint 6695, 128-29. As such, plaintiffs argue
   that the means called for by the Policy are not narrowly tailored to
   any legitimate interest defendants may have in regulating obscenity
   and child pornography.

   The Policy also prohibits access to materials which are "deemed
   Harmful to Juveniles under applicable Virginia statutes and-legal
   precedents." This appears to be a reference to Virginia Code
   '18.2-390, which defines materials "Harmful to Juveniles" to include
   sexual content that:



     (a) predominately appeals to the prurient, shameful or morbid
     interest of juveniles, (b) is patently offensive to prevailing
     standards in the adult community as a whole with respect to what is
     suitable material for juveniles, and (c) is, when taken as a whole,
     lacking in serious literary, artistic, political or scientific value
     for juveniles.



   Plaintiffs allege that the Policy improperly limits adult Internet
   speech to what is fit for children. In support, plaintiffs cite Reno,
   117 S. Ct. at 2329. In Reno, the Supreme Court held that a
   content-based Internet regulation intended to prevent the transmission
   of material harmful to minors was unconstitutional because it
   suppressed speech adults were constitutionally entitled to send and
   receive. The Court stated: (start page 33)



     it is true that we have repeatedly recognized the governmental
     interest in protecting children from harmful materials. But that
     interest does not justify an unnecessarily broad suppression of
     speech addressed to adults. As we have explained, the Government may
     not "reduc[e] the adult population ... to ... only what is fit for
     children."



   Id. at 2346 (quoting Denver Area Telecomm. Consortium v. FCC, 116
   S.Ct. 2374, 2393 (1996)) (citations omitted). The Court went on to
   cite Bolger v. Youngs Drug Products Corp., 463 U.S. 60 (1983), for the
   proposition that: "'[R]egardless of the strength of the government's
   interest' in protecting children, '[t]he level of discourse reaching a
   mailbox simply cannot be limited to that which would be suitable for a
   sandbox.'" Reno, 117 S. Ct. at 2346 (quoting Bolger, 463 U.S. at
   74-75). Applying Reno to the instant case, it is clear that defendants
   may not, in the interest of protecting children, limit the speech
   available to adults to what is fit for "juveniles." As plaintiffs
   point out, even when government regulation of content is undertaken
   for a legitimate purpose, whether it be to prevent the communication
   of obscene speech or materials harmful to children, the means it uses
   must be a "reasonable response to the threat" which will alleviate the
   harm "in a direct and material way." Turner Broadcasting v. FCC, 512
   U.S. 622, 624 (1994). Plaintiffs have adequately alleged a lack of
   such reasonable means here. As (start page 34) such, plaintiffs have
   stated a valid First Amendment claim which may go forward.



     B.  The Unblocking Policy



   Defendants contend that, even if the First Amendment limits the
   Library Board's discretion to remove materials, the unblocking
   procedure ensures the constitutionality of the Policy because it
   allows library staff to make certain that only constitutionally
   unprotected materials are blocked. Under the unblocking policy,
   library patrons who have been denied access to a site may submit a
   written request which must include their name, telephone number, and a
   detailed explanation of why they desire access to the blocked site.
   The library staff then "decide[s] whether the request should be
   granted." Def. Brief at 3. (FOOTNOTE 4)

   Plaintiffs argue that the unblocking procedure constitutes an
   unconstitutional burden on the right of library patrons to access
   protected speech, citing Lamont, 381 U.S. at 301. The statute at issue
   in Lamont directed the Postmaster General not to deliver "communist
   propaganda" to postal patrons unless they (start page 35) first
   returned to the Post Office a card bearing their names and addressess
   and specifically requesting that such materials be sent to them. See
   id. at 302-04. The Supreme Court held the statute to be
   "unconstitutional because it require [d] an official act (viz.,
   returning the reply card) as a limitation on the unfettered exercise
   of the addressees' First Amendment rights." Id. at 305. In particular,
   the Court noted the severe chilling effect of forcing citizens to
   publicly petition the Government for access to speech it clearly
   disfavored. See id. at 307.

   Here, as in Lamont, the unblocking policy forces adult patrons to
   petition the Government for access to otherwise protected speech, for
   example speech "Harmful to Juveniles." Indeed, the Loudoun County
   unblocking policy appears more chilling than the restriction at issue
   in Lamont, because it grants library staff standardless discretion to
   refuse access to protected speech, whereas the statute at issue in
   Lamont required postal employees to grant access requests
   automatically. As such, defendants' alleged unblocking procedure does
   not in any way undercut plaintiffs' First Amendment claim.

   V.  Conclusion

   For the reasons set forth above, defendants' Motion to Dismiss the
   Individual Defendants will be GRANTED, and their (start page 36)
   Motion to Dismiss for Failure to State a Claim will be GRANTED IN PART
   as to certain plaintiffs and DENIED in all other respects. As to
   defendants' Motion in the Alternative for Summary Judgment, this Court
   holds that several material factual issues remain which mandate
   against summary judgment at this time. These include, but are not
   limited to, defendants, justification for the Policy, the Internet
   sites blocked by X-Stop, and the degree of defendant's knowledge of
   and control over the sites X-Stop blocks. Accordingly, defendants'
   Motion in the Alternative for Summary Judgment will also be DENIED. An
   appropriate order will issue.

   The Clerk is directed to forward copies of this Memorandum Opinion to
   counsel of record.

   Entered this 7th day of April, 1998.

   Footnotes

   1.  In a February 24, 1998 Order, this Court granted a Motion to
   Intervene as Plaintiffs made by several individuals and organizations
   which publish speech on the Internet. Intervenors argue that
   defendants have unconstitutionally interfered with their First
   Amendment rights as speakers to communicate with Loudoun County
   library patrons. The intervenors, claim is not explicitly at issue in
   the motions now before the Court.

   2.  Although the Court allowed the action to continue, it held that an
   award of costs and attorneys' fees pursuant to 42 U.S.C. '1988 was
   inappropriate because any such award was premised on the Virginia
   court's legislative activities, for which they enjoyed absolute
   immunity. See id. at 738-39.

   3.  As in Consumer Union, plaintiff's request for costs and attorneys'
   fees pursuant to 42 U.S.C. '1988 may be inappropriate if premised on
   the Library Board's decision to adopt the Policy, a decision made in
   its legislative capacity. See Consumers Union, 446 U.S. at 738-39. We
   need not and do not make such a determination at this early stage in
   the litigation.

   4.  For purposes of defendants' Motion to Dismiss for Failure to State
   a Claim or, in the Alternative, for Summary Judgment, the Court
   accepts plaintiffs' description of the unblocking policy as accurate.
   See Complaint 66127-29.
