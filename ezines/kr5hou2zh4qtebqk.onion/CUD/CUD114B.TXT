Secret Service jurisdiction over computer crimes is set out in
18 USC 1030(d):

    The United States Secret Service shall, in addition to any other agency
    having such authority, have the authority to investigate offenses under
    this section. [18 USC 1030 is titled "Fraud and related activity in
    connection with computers.] Such authority of the United States Secret
    Service shall be exercised in accordance with an agreement which shall
    be entered into by the Secretary of the Treasury and the Attorney
    General.

There is a similar provision in 18 USC 1029, which concerns
"Fraud and related activity in connection with access devices."

Can someone answer the following?

Operation Sun Devil is a two year investigation. If I'm counting right,
including the number of federal and state officers involved in serving
search warrants, at least 300 were involved in some capacity.

Also, if I'm counting right, there have been only 9 arrests:

  1) One guy in California who was arrested during a search on
     an unrelated charge (weapon's possession)(Doc Ripco?)
  2) One guy in Chicago who was arrested during the search on an
     unrelated charge (weapons)
  3) A woman in Pittsburgh (Electra?)
  4) Terminus in New Jersey
  5) Anthony Nusall in Tucson
  6) Craig Neidorf (for publishing phrack)
  7) Robert Riggs (for E911 documents)
  8) Adam Grant (Atlanta)
  9) Frank Darden (Atlanata)

The first four were busted in January, and the last four in the last month.
So, of the 9, only 7 were busted on computer-related charges.  Of the 7,
the charges seem bogus at best, such as Craig Neidorf's, if the information
I've read is even half accurate.

Now, here's my question: If warrants are supposed to indicate a crime has
been committed, shouldn't there be more arrests if there is such a crime
wave out there? After all that time, all that investigation, all that
hype---where's all the crooks??

I suppose the cops could say it takes time to collect evidence.  But aren't
they supposed to have evidence when they get the search warrants?  How long
can it possibly take to acquire evidence if the groundwork has already been
laid and if cops supposedly know what they're looking for?? Am I missing
something? Will other charges be like those reported against Craig--for
publishing? If I havae phrack 24 and the E911 file, does that make me a
crook? If I uploaded it to a board.  Can that board be busted for receiving
stolen information?

Maybe I'm missing something, but is there something wrong here?

Where is this giant conspiracy? Where is all the harm that's going on? I
guess the cops would say they can't talk while an investigation is going
on, but hasn't it been going on for years?  Shouldn't they have something
they can convey other than general notions of threats to national security,
huge losses, major conspiracies, and the rest of their babble?

Is there something wrong with this picture??
