 MISSOURI STUDENT PLEADS INNOCENT IN 911 SYSTEM INTRUSION CASE

 Craig Neidorf, a 19-year-old University of Missouri student, has pleaded not
guilty to federal allegations that he invaded the 911 emergency phone network
for 9 states.

 As reported earlier, he was indicted this month along with Robert J. Riggs,
20, of Decatur, Ga.  Both are charged with interstate transportation of stolen
property, wire fraud, and violations of the federal Computer Fraud and Abuse
Act of 1986.

 Prosecutors contend the two used computers to enter the 911 system of
Atlanta's Bell South, then copied the program that controls and maintains the
system.  The stolen material later allegedly was published on a computer
bulletin board system operating in the Chicago suburb of Lockport.
Authorities contend Neidorf edited the data for an electronic publication
known as "Phrack."

 According to Associated Press writer Sarah Nordgren, in a recent hearing on
the case Assistant U.S. Attorney William Cook was granted a motion to prevent
the 911 program from becoming part of the public record during the trial.
U.S. District Judge Nicholas Bua set April 16 for a trial.

 The 911 system in question controls emergency calls to police, fire,
ambulance and emergency services in cities in Alabama, Mississippi, Georgia,
Tennessee, Kentucky, Louisiana, North Carolina, South Carolina and Florida.

The following is a press release from the Australian Federal Police
concerning the Australian hacker "Dave" mentioned recently in the
New York Times and two other hackers.  Credit where it is due -- this
information came to me from Paul Pavlinovich in Australia where it was
originally posted on a Melbourne University newsgroup.

                        "MEDIA RELEASE"

                                        Monday 2 April, 1990

COMPUTERS SEIZED - THREE ARRESTED

Australian Federal Police detectives have executed four search
warrants on three private residences and a business address
following a six month investigation into computer hacking.

Three men, an 18 year old student of North Caulfield, a 20 year
old student of Greensborough and a 21 year old Computer
Programmer of Frankston have been arrested and are being
interviewed by Federal Police.

Federal Police computer crime investigators say their inquiries
have centred on three hackers who have used the code names
'Phoenix', 'Electron' and 'Nom'.

The hackers are alleged to have been gaining illegal access, or
breaking into computer systems in the United States and Australia.
It is alleged that whilst the hackers were accessing restricted
files and information, they also caused damage to those systems.

Australian Federal Police allege the hackers used Telecom and
Overseas Telecommunications Corporation (OTC) facilities for
their illegal activeities, via modems at their home addresses.
Through the telephone system they would then use their personal
computers (PC) to communicate with the other computer systems in
the northern hemisphere and across Australia.

The activeities of one computer hacker was brought to the
attention of the United States Secret Service in 1988 at which
time investigations by the Service showed the Citibank system had
been illegally entered by an Australian-based hacker known as
Phoenix.

Further reports of extensive illegal entry to US computers
followed throughout 1989.

Federal Police were able to launch their investigation following
the introduction in July last year of new Legislation under Part
6A of the Commonwealth Crimes Act covering offences relating to
the illegal use of computers.

They allege one of the hackers under investigation was identified
in recent media stories as 'David' or 'Dave'.

He was quoted in the media as having claimed success in his
attempts to 'hack' into computers in the United States and stated
he was not concerned about being caught, because "he knew that
in Australia the laws could punish him with no more than a small
fine for trespass."

Under the new legislation, Section 76E of the Crimes Act provides
for a maximum penalty of 10 years imprisonment for;

        "Damaging data in Commonwealth and other
        computers by means of a Commonwealth facility."

There is no provision for a fine.

The AFP officer heading the investigation Detective
Superintendent Ken Hunt said, it was not unusual for the
Australian hackers to spend up to 16 hours a day on their PC's
and other computers.

He said, much of that time would be spent on international
telephone lines, with the hackers, through their computer
keyboards, directing the cost of their calls to be met by the
companies whose computer systems they had illegally accessed.

Federal Police were required to enter the premises of the
suspects early this morning and quickly disable their computers
to prevent the destruction of programme software.

During the execution of the search warrants a considerable
amount of computer software, print outs and other documentation
was seized.
