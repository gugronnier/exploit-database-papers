INVITATION
   from Charles W. Jermy, Associate Dean
        Cornell School of Continuing Education and Summer Sessions

As you know well, colleges and universities are in the midst of an
information technology revolution.  Faculty, staff, students, alumni,
and the general public are using information resources and technologies
in new and transforming ways.  The Internet and the World Wide Web have
become indispensable tools, not just for research and instruction, but
for numerous business functions as well:  admissions, grade reporting,
student services, public information, development, and much more.

As we rely on the Web to share information with individuals both inside
and outside our organizations, we also take on a new spectrum of risks
and liabilities.  Those who depend on information technology to do
their jobs need guidance on the often very confusing legal requirements
governing that technology.  The Internet Risks and Liability Workshop
is an intensive one-day program that identifies the most effective
procedures for ensuring the legal and ethical use of the Internet for a
variety of business purposes.

The presenters explain -- in non-technical, jargon-free language -- how
the Internet really works and what the relevant laws mean.  They
highlight current legislation and case law, illustrated by live
Internet demonstrations.  They also describe effective practices for
limiting institutional risk and liabilities, while upholding the
principles of intellectual property and free expression.  The program
concludes with guidance on developing institution-specific Internet
policies and practicies.

As never before, information technology professionals, legal counsel,
and policy makers must work together to determine the steps our
institutions should take to thrive in the Information Age.  I hope you
will plan on participating in the program.

(1) CIVIL LIBERTIES GROUPS CALL ON FCC TO PROTECT PRIVACY, SECURITY AS FBI
    PUSHES DIGITAL TELEPHONY LAW

Dec. 15 -- Three leading online civil liberties groups have urged the
Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to find that the FBI is trying
improperly to enhance its surveillance capabilities, and is overlooking key
privacy rights, under a controversial 1994 wiretap law.

The Center for Democracy and Technology (CDT), Computer Professionals for
Social Responsibility (CPSR), and the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF)
asked the FCC on December 12  to take a more active role in protecting
privacy as telephone companies and the FBI struggle to implement the new
wiretap law. The three groups urged the FCC not to focus solely on
personnel security practices and recordkeeping among the telephone
companies affected by the law, as it has been doing, but instead to broaden
its examination by demanding that the digital technology the companies plan
to use be made tamperproof.

The Comments, along with detailed background information on CALEA, will be
posted soon at http://www.cdt.org/digi_tele/

CALEA BACKGROUND

Congress enacted the Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act
(CALEA), more commonly called the "digital telephony" law, in October 1994.
The law requires telecommunications carriers--primarily local telephone
companies and wireless service providers--to upgrade their switching
equipment and computer software so that law enforcement officials can
perform wiretaps and other forms of electronic surveillance despite the
addition of new technologies.

Congress passed CALEA to assuage the concern of law enforcement that new
digital modes of transmitting information could render wiretapping
obsolete. Like so many new technologies, however, digital telephony can be
a boon to the pursuer as well as to the wrongdoer. With digital telephony
law enforcement officials can amass much more detailed information on a
private citizen's calling habits than ever before. The debate over CALEA
depends, at least in part, on whether it will be implemented in a way that
maintains law enforcement's  traditional surveillance capabilities, or
whether government will use it as an excuse to exploit the full
surveillance capabilities of digital technology.

Fcc Proceeding Fails To Give Adequate Attention To Privacy

In October, the FCC issued a "Notice of Proposed Rulemaking" seeking
comments from the communications industry, law enforcement agencies and the
public on CALEA. The notice focused almost entirely on two areas: the
telephone companies' recordkeeping and personnel security practices, and
the definition of key terms in the 1994 law. CDT and the other two groups
joining in last Friday's filing argue that the Commission has overlooked
the issue of privacy in its efforts to flesh out the law, despite Congress'
clear directives in the statute that privacy be protected.

While the FCC's proposed rules require more detailed recordkeeping and
background checks on phone company employees, Congress specifically called
for systems designed to protect the privacy of communications not
authorized to be intercepted. In CDT's view, this requires telephone
companies to withhold information which law enforcement doesn't have
specific legal authority to intercept. As telephone companies increasingly
adopt packet switching protocols, the separation of call content from
packet addressing information becomes critical to ensure that law
enforcement doesn't receive call content without probable cause.

IMPLEMENTATION DELAYED

A series of disputes has delayed the implementation of the law. In the past
two years the FBI has twice attempted to draft notices to telephone
companies outlining how many wiretap intercepts they can be required, under
the law, to perform at one time in any given service area. Both of these
drafts have been roundly criticized for proposing a surveillance capacity
that far exceeds traditional law enforcement needs. On the separate
question of capability, the telecommunications industry earlier this year
proposed a compliance standard that calls for switching software upgrades
to make interceptions easier. But the FBI opposed adopting that standard
because it doesn't go far enough to satisfy the Bureau's demands for
enhanced surveillance capabilities. For example, the industry standard
calls for tracking capabilities in wireless telephones. The FBI, however,
wants other features, such as the ability to continue monitoring parties on
a conference call even after the person named in the surveillance order has
left the call. The FBI also wants telecommunications carriers to be
required to provide law enforcement with more detailed information on a
citizen's calling practices.

COMPUTER SECURITY

Computers increasingly control telecommunications switching, and most of
the telephone companies' efforts to comply with CALEA will involve changes
to the software that controls switching within the companies' central
offices. Carriers will soon be establishing computerized surveillance
administration functions, that, in turn, may be networked with other system
administration functions and also linked to computers located outside the
switching office. All in all, the changes could leave the carriers' systems
vulnerable to employees bent on doing mischief, or to malicious hackers.

Because of this possibility, CDT, EFF and CPSR have urged the FCC to
examine the security of these new software protocols. Among the factors
that CDT believes the FCC should require are:

 * System integrity. Both hardware and software systems must be tamperproof.
   Most systems have a maintenance function that allows "backdoor" access,
which
   could be used to subvert the entire system.

 * Simple authentication for individual system users. Fixed passwords for user
   identification are inherently dangerous because they reside in the system's
   memory and can be plucked out by technology-savvy wrongdoers.

 * System-to-system authentication. When whole systems within the telephone
   industry are networked to each other, it's equally important that each
system
   be able to authenticate contact with another system.

 * Audit trails which the industry can use to review surveillance activity.

 * Intrusion detection programs within the telephone systems themselves which
   will help identify when a surveillance technology is being put to an
improper
   use.

Subject: File 4--The Big Lie : AAS editorial on "Cyberspace Issues"

Source --  fight-censorship@vorlon.mit.edu

Below is an editorial that ran in Wednesday's Austin American Statesman.

My response letter is appended below, and I encourage other
fight-censorship subscribers to write letters to the editors of their
local newspapers.   We can yak to each other till the cows come home
but we need to express our ideas in other forums and other audiences as
well.


There are some things I didn't address in my letter that I want to bring
up online -- namely that the issues of children, adult material, and
filtering is difficult enough without the Statesman deliberately
distorting the experience of what it is like to be online.

Out of the thousands and thousands of websites that I have looked at in
my life I can only remember two instances of "uninvited smut".  Once
because I didn't read the preceding link page closely enough and the
second where someone was making the point about how rarely this happens.
 Also, being sent an e-mail solicitation to join or look at a sexually
explicit site is not the same as being sent pornography.

Anyone with an e-mail address knows that if there is pornography on your
screen, it's because you took deliberate actions and steps to place it
there.  That's what it is like to be online but you would never know
that from reading their editorial page.


Cyberspace issues
Austin American Statesman
Wednesday, December 03, 1997

It is axiomatic that the federal government should tread lightly around
the Internet. The U.S. Supreme Court said so clearly this year in
striking down the Communications Decency Act, Congress' attempt to block
online pornography.

But that doesn't mean the World Wide Web should be a sexual free-fire
zone where anything goes whether you want it or not. Anyone with an
e-mail address can attest to the flood of sexually explicit messages and
solicitations that greet the user nowadays.

A conference in Washington this week is exploring ways to make the
Internet safe for children and adults who wish not to be entertained by
the smut available in cyberspace. They have their work cut out for them
because any screening or rating system is greeted by screeches of
protest from the civil libertarians who won't care what the children
see.

It isn't in the government's interest, and possibly not within its
grasp, to be the online censor. The solution to uninvited smut via
computer should be improving the technology in the marketplace.

Among the issues being explored at the Washington conference are
filtering software and ratings programs. President Clinton has called
for universal self-rating for Internet companies, but that idea has had
a tepid reception so far.

It is in the best interest of the online companies and Internet
providers to offer a filtering system that works. Twice as many
households with children have computers as households without children.
Those families have a vital interest in protecting their children from
the sexually explicit offerings on the Internet.

Free speech critics complain the filtering systems filter too much,
blocking protected speech as well as pornography. Some family-oriented
groups claim they don't filter enough and smut creeps in.

Although self-rating has flopped so far, third-party ratings may hold
the answer for the civil libertarians and those concerned about
pornography online. Under that system, a third-party rates the Web
publishers and the individual user can choose the rating he or she
prefers.

As for the sleazy e-mail messages, Congress is considering bills to make
it a criminal act to offer sexual content to minors through e-mail. That
may or may not pass Supreme Court muster.

But there, too, the answer may lie in improved technology that will
allow those who want everything to get it and those who wish to protect
themselves and their families from sleazy solicitors to do so.

Letter to the Editorial
December 3, 1997


The computer magazine Family PC recently polled 750 subscribers about
family life online.  While a majority expressed concerns about their
children accessing sexually explicit material, 73% of them felt that
monitoring their children's use of the Internet, being involved in their
children's activities, and setting specific rules for participation
would be their approach and strategy to guiding and raising their
children online.  This is what parents do in real life.

In your editorial about cyberspace issues, however, the only solutions
to these social and moral issues you think are worth discussing involve
sitting around and waiting for the technology that will save us.

If you truly want to help parents, cut back on the screeching and
fear-mongering about all the bad things that could happen to children
online and replace it with some of the common sense advice available at
sites like Safe Kids Online (http://www.safekids.com) and Netparents
(http://www.netparents.org).  You might sell less newspapers but you'll
be doing everyone involved a favor.
