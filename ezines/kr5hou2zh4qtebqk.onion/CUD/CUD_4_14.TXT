Subject: File 1-- Alternative To The Well

There is another system on the internet - The InteleCom DataForum - at
192.67.241.11, which gives access to anyone for only $10 a month,
unlimited time. No flat-rate/hourly charge combo. Very affordable for
a college student who doesn't have USENET at his/her local school, or
needs an alternative login from a terminal server, etc.

I should imagine that this arrangement is set up (a) because it is
administratively convenient, and (b) so as to avoid the allegations
that Craig is feathering his own nest.

All monies received from, or on behalf of, clients must be placed into
that client's trust account. This is the account into which a lawyer
must place monies received in advance from his/her client for
safekeeping until a bill is rendered to the client. The purpose of
such an arrangement is so that the lawyer has some form of guarantee
that he will get paid (at least to the extent that he has money on
trust).

Secondly, if the money were to be sent directly to Craig, there would
no doubt be the cynical few who would raise (quite correctly I'd
imagine) the problem of how we can guarantee that _all_ the money
donated will be used for his trial defence.

I hope this clears up some of the mystery.

Subject: File 4-- Readers' Reply: "Bury Usenet?" (CuD #4.10)

(In response to "Bury Usenet," in CuD #4.10):
I would like to address a point which neither Steinberg nor Sanio
mentioned; the "variety" factor.

I certainly agree with Steinberg's implied position that television
is a vast wasteland.  However, there are still many portions of the
television medium which provide useful, informative services.  The
obvious example for US viewers is PBS, which consistently airs in-
tellectually stimulating and through-provoking programs.  For those
of us served by cable television, the Discovery Channel, CNBC, C-SPAN,
and Lifetime Medical Television are additional examples of "quality TV",
in my opinion.

With Usenet, we can find parallels for both "Three's Company" and
the Discovery Channel.  Can Steinberg deny the beneficial aspects of
newsgroups such as comp.sys.sun.*, comp.unix.admin, or comp.lang.c?
While there are certainly newsgroups which have degenerated into
digital shouting matches, there is still a wide variety of rational,
informative discussion in Usenet.

Steinberg mentions the lack of "collaboration" among Usenet participants.
As rebuttal to that statement, I offer the dozens of situations/problems
for which I have found solutions/resolutions via Usenet newsgroups.  I
have been made aware of countless bugs, security holes, and "lurking"
problems through Usenet.

I've also participated in several beta tests of software through Usenet;
I've reviewed papers and policies, received bug reports on my own code,
and shared my own experiences with hundreds of Usenet readers.

>He describes USENET as
>"a noble but failed experiment" and suggests to abandon it and
>research other directions in order to improve communications and
>quality of life.

Is the television or print media in danger of abandonment?  I don't
think so.  It still serves a large group of people, whose needs and
wants lie in almost every part of the intellectual spectrum.

>Browsing may be hard in high-traffic boards, especially when the subject
>information is poor or dated during a longer-lasting discussion thread.

I'd point out that finding something decent on the television may be
equally difficult; the routine location of a "quality" program on the
radio is almost impossible.  Of course, we all develop our own personal
"schedule" of quality television and radio programs; I'm sure that each
of us could easily rattle off the time slots of those programs which we
find appealing.

We may examine several copies of a given magazine, evaluating its
relevance to, and addressing of, our needs or preferences.  If a
particular magazine doesn't appeal to us, we cancel that subscription
(or stop borrowing it from a library or friend).  I'm sure that each
of us could easily rattle off the names of those magazines which we
find appealing.

An identical "scheduling" occurs among Usenet readers.  As we participate
in Usenet, we naturally dismiss those newsgroups which we find unappealing;
the Usenet "subscription" mechanism implements this quite well.  At one
time or another, I have read every newsgroup carried by my site; over the
years, that huge list has been "pared down" to those 250 newsgroups which
appeal to me.  I would assume that every Usenet reader does the same; I
don't believe that anyone could read *every* newsgroup.

Given this personal "scheduling", what is the difference between Usenet and
any other medium?


>- "low bandwidth", meaning messages in 80-column ASCII opposed to multi-
>  media communication

This is an almost necessary limitation of the medium.  Sites participating
in Usenet run the gamut of computing systems; almost every type of computer
system is represented in Usenet.  While there are Crays and Suns on the net,
there are also AT&T 3b1s, PCs, Macintoshes, Primes, and even (I believe) a
Tandy Color Computer or two.  Many Usenet sites cannot support multimedia;
should those sites be excluded?  Should Steinberg deprive himself of a sub-
stantial audience by submitting his articles in multimedia format?

>Steve's comments on poor mastership of written language sound a bit
>arrogant and elitist to me.

They certainly do.  Does Steinberg wish to replace newsgroup moderators with
"grammar police"?

{sarcasm++;}
Shall we accept the _MLA Handbook_ as the sole authority for Usenet style?
Perhaps we should adopt "The Elements of Style" or the GPO Style Manual as
our Writs of Common Wisdom.  As an alternative, we may simply require a cer-
tain score on the _Usenet Qualification Examination_.  Of course, all pros-
pective Usenet articles must be properly justified and proofread.
{sarcasm--;}

Usenet works; it may have a few worn springs in its digital suspension,
and some of its passengers may be a bit rowdy, but it stills takes more
people from point A to point B than any current alternatives.

Moving on to Steinberg's comments on moderated newsgroups.......

>> However, there is the insidious danger of moderator bias.

Does the same danger exist in the television or print media?
Does the same danger exist when you submit a book to a publisher?
Does the same danger exist when you submit a paper to a journal?

This "insidious danger" (as Steinberg so hyperbolically phrases it) is
a natural, necessary part of the moderation/editing process.  How can
it be a "danger" when all participants in the process know that certain
editorial standards are being applied?

Most newspapers reserve the right to edit Letters to the Editor; why
doesn't anyone complain about that?  Newspapers do not print every
letter they receive; why don't we hear a great hue and cry about that
'bias'?  I believe that this behavior continues, unassailed, because
all parties involved understand that it is part of the natural pro-
cess.

>> Whether Townsend actually censors messages he disagrees with is not
>> important.

Actually, Patrick is *incapable* of "censoring" messages with which he
disagrees.  He may choose not to include your article in his digest;
that's his right/obligation as the editor/moderator.  However, he is
NOT censoring you; you may still distribute that article far and wide,
through several different media.  He has no means by which he can pre-
vent you from doing this.  Therefore, he is not censoring you; he is
merely preventing you from using HIS service to disseminate your infor-
mation and/or opinions.  This is NOT censorship; it is management.  While
Random House may not accept your book for publication, do they prevent
you from securing the services of Bantam Books as your publisher?  I don't
think so.  Why, then, is Patrick's parallel action assailed as "censorship"?

>> The perception -- and the possibility -- are there.

That perception, and its related possibility, are present in every form
of mass media.  That possibility applies to _Newsweek_, _Southern Living_,
_Byte_ and _The Edmonton Herald-News_ equally.  How do you propose to
eliminate this possibility in every form of mass communication?  More
importantly, why should an electronic journal be held to a different
standard than its hardcopy counterparts?

>>1: There is no danger because an alternate group with no moderator can
>>be easily formed.
>
>This is completely orthogonal to my article on USENET. Sure, we can
>start an alternate group, but this just brings us back the noise
>problem and we will be no closer to a more effective USENET.

Why is this orthogonal?  You have now argued, in successive articles,
that both unmoderated and moderated newsgroups are inefficient; how,
then, shall we meet your goal of a clean, efficient electronic mass
medium?

>If a moderator can censor, and
>many people think he is, then the newsgroup is surely less trustworthy
>than an unmoderated one.

Let me ask you this: do you base your entire opinion on one source of
information?  I read national, regional, and local newspapers; I have
found that each provides a different viewpoint on the same issues.  In
Usenet, I read both info.academic-freedom and alt.comp.acad-freedom.talk;
I have found that each provides a different viewpoint on the same issues,
since one is moderated and the other is free of moderation.

>I merely used Townson's newsgroup because his moderation has become
>the most controversial. I don't think Townson would disagree with
>this.  I certainly could have used CuD as my example, and pointed out
>that many people believe that the anti-hacker viewpoint is censored
>from the digest, but this perception is held by fewer people.

This perception may exist, but both mailing lists are experiencing
sustained growth.  Could it be that people accept a certain bias or
influence in a given medium, just as we do with our daily newspaper
or television news broadcast?

Subject: File 5-- More on the Internet Debate

The following article just appeared in comp.society. I feel it
represents, by its mere presence, the proper challenge to the Intertek
nonsense. The author, Steinberg, clearly sets out to stir debate, and
does that adequately, though I saw nothing which is not a compilation
restatement of discussions which have been on the net for years. The
article I read in CuD 4.09 falls short of being "professional" by that
mystical inch that's as good as a mile. I understand McMullen's
charitable review a kindness to help inspire a young man to continue
and therein to progress.

Collaborations on a professional level abound as a direct consequence
of usenet and the internet. There are many undocumented private
mailing lists serving scientific and technical interests.

           WHAT SCHOLARS WANT AND NEED FROM ELECTRONIC JOURNALS

                       Stevan Harnad

For scholars and scientists, paper is not an end but a means. It has
served us well for several millennia, but it would have been surprising
indeed if this man-made medium had turned out to be optimal for all
time. In reality, paper has always had one notable drawback. Although
it allowed us to encode, preserve and share ideas and findings
incomparably more effectively than we could ever have done orally, its
tempo was always lamentably slower than the oral interactions to which
the speed of thought seems organically adapted. Electronic journals
have now made it possible for scholarly publication to escape this
rate-limiting constraint of the paper medium, allowing scholarly
communication to become much more rapid, global and interactive than
ever before. It is important that we not allow the realization
of the new medium's revolutionary potential to be retarded by clinging
superstitiously to familiar but incidental features of the paper
medium.

It is also useful to remind ourselves now and again why scholars and
scientists do what they do, rather than going straight into the junk
bond market: They presumably want to contribute to mankind's cumulative
knowledge. They have to make a living too, of course, but if doing that
as comfortably and prosperously as possible were their primary motive
they could surely find better ways. Prestige no doubt matters too, but
here again there are less rigorous roads one might have taken than
that of learned inquiry. So scholars publish not primarily to pad
their CVs or to earn royalties on their words, but to inform their peers
of their findings, and to be informed by them in turn, in that
collaborative, interactive spiral whereby mankind's knowledge
increases. My own estimate is that the new medium has the potential to
extend individual scholars' intellectual life-lines (i.e., the
size of their lifelong contribution) by an order of magnitude.

What scholars accordingly need is electronic journals that provide:
(1) rapid, expert peer-review, (2) rapid copy-editing, proofing and
publication of accepted articles, (3) rapid, interactive, peer
commentary, and (4) a permanent, universally accessible, searchable and
retrievable electronic archive. Ideally, the true costs of providing
these services should be subsidized by Universities, Learned Societies,
Libraries and the Government, but if they must be passed on to the
"scholar-consumer," let us make sure that they are only the real costs,
and not further unnecessary ones arising from emulating inessential
features of the old medium. PSYCOLOQUY, an peer-reviewed electronic
journal sponsored by the American Psychological Association and
co-edited and archived at Princeton and Rutgers Universities, is
attempting to provide a model for future scholarly electronic
periodicals of this kind.

+++++++++++++++++cut here for online announcement of my candidacy

MARCH 6, 1992, SAN MATEO, CALIFORNIA:  Progress begins with
initiative, a coming together of a vision and the will to accomplish
great things.  Silicon Valley entrepreneurs know this very well.  For
too long, career politicians have laid barriers in the way of people
working to build a humane, viable future with the tools that
technology has given them.  When the people have asked for widespread
access to telecommunications, computing power, and education,
old-school politicians have pointed to the necessity for defense
spending instead of making investments in the future.  That's why I'm
announcing my candidacy for the U.S. House of Representatives in the
reapportioned twelfth Congressional District of California.  My
district covers most of the area from San Mateo up to Golden Gate Park
in San Francisco.  As a Democrat, I will be challenging our twelve
year incumbent in the June Primary.

A few weeks ago I asked Congressman Tom Lantos' staff how he voted
last year.  Their initial response was to hand me the glossy
advertising brochure that our tax dollars paid for.  When pressed to
find out how he voted, or didn't vote, I was ushered into their
library, shown to the Congressional Record, and told to look it up
myself day by day.  This is how my representative, from one of the
most technologically advanced districts, brings information to his
constituents.  Career politicians have remained dedicated to high
defense spending while the real tools needed for worldwide economic
competition are lying dormant.  We need to encourage the young,
trained minds of our country, and to provide the communications power
to unleash that talent.

Every day we are faced with non-technical problems such as health
insurance, jobs, and our economy, but I feel very strongly that our
country needs to look at the future of technology: how it can be used
or abused, and how it is abusing all of us.  Technology is advancing
far faster than our laws can cope, which raises many legal,
sociological, ethical, and constitutional questions.  Answering these
questions requires both an understanding of the technology and actual
experiences with the technology.

Our greatest resources for the future are our children and our world.
Our country needs to take a proactive role in producing the best
educated future generation that we can, as well as having a place for
that generation to live and be productive.  We need to find innovative
and creative ways to put technology to work for our future rather than
putting up legislative roadblocks to the future.  Providing the
information and education we and our children need to be competitive
in the future is coupled to our economy.  We can't be productive
today, nor can our children compete in the future, without information
and education.  We must plan for the twenty-first century today.

We are faced with a society of economic haves and have-nots.  Most of
us actively involved with technology and information access know that
information is power.  We are fast becoming a nation of information
"knows" and "know-nots", and those who do not have the information
will be in an even more devastating position than those who are just
economically disadvantaged.  Our government itself works to keep
information unavailable to us.  We need to bring information to the
people, and get information from the people to our elected officials.
This will help bring the power back to the people.  You can be an
elected official without being a career politician, but you can't
legislate technological issues unless you understand the technology.
We need elected officials who are online and accessible, and with whom
information flows -- to them and from them as a dialogue.

One of the problems of our political system is that it takes money to
win.  Too often these funds come from Political Action Committees.
The traditional view has been that campaign funding is spent to "get
the message out".  The online community finally has a chance to use
this new medium to not only get a message out, but to discuss the
issues without spending obscene amounts of money.  Let's use my
campaign as a demonstration of the power of online politics.  Pass
this release and my platform on to your friends and colleagues, and
around your town.  Even though California's twelfth Congressional
District covers the area from San Mateo up to Golden Gate Park in San
Francisco, these issues need to be discussed online and in the media
nationwide.  We of the online community are currently an
under-represented constituency.  Let's change that.  Let's get
Congress online.

Even an online campaign isn't free.  Network etiquette precludes me
from asking for campaign contributions, but please do contact me

Congressional Candidate Glenn Tenney's Platform For Our Future

   MARCH 6, 1992, SAN MATEO, CALIFORNIA:  Most candidates look like
every other candidate on most issues.  I am differentiated on
high-tech issues.  Here's how I feel about a few traditional and
technological issues:

*       We need to be competitive in the "global village" world
economy, to focus on America without being protectionist.  Education
and information are keys to achieving these goals.

*       Our country, from the top down, needs to look years into the
future instead of just months.  Our country and our businesses also
need to understand that our people are our major asset for the future.
We must rescue our environment to have a future.

*       Being in business for myself, not being wealthy, and having
raised five boys means that my wife and I live the health care problem
daily.  A tax credit next year doesnUt help us pay our insurance
premium next month, let alone help us find insurance.  Our country
must commit to defining and providing a minimal level of health care
to everyone.

*       When my wife and I decided to become parents we fortunately
had access to all the information and options, and had the right to a
choice.  I am pro-family and pro-choice.

*       Recent events in what was the Soviet Union offers us the
opportunity of our lifetime to take dramatic steps towards world
peace, and a true peace-time economy.  We must significantly reduce
our defense budget while helping defense businesses and their workers
transition to non-defense ventures.  Our country's enormous supply of
talent currently committed to defense-related projects can be put to
effective and innovative use in solving many other problems.  We can
do this and maintain defensive strength.

*       We must encourage businesses to invest in our future both by
reducing long term capital gains taxes (for capital that is actually a
long term investment in our future) and providing tax incentives for
research and development.  Having participated in chip designs, and
seeing how biotechnology is progressing, I know that many innovations
require a large long-term capital investment.

*       There are tremendous changes waiting to happen if only we can
provide high-speed computer and data networks between our
universities, public schools (K-12) and homes.  We need to take steps
to wire our country for Integrated Services Digital Network (ISDN) or
'fiber to the home.'  Affordable ubiquitous networked computing will
have an effect that can hardly be imagined by those outside of the
field.

*       Most people get their news from television. About two-thirds
of our homes receive that news on cable TV, yet only a small number of
companies choose what channels are available.  Cable TV affords us
many advantages, yet like all technologies it is a double edged sword.
We need policies that better deal with these "monopolies", and which
provide for true competition.

*       Technology is encroaching more and more into our everyday
life, and abusing our privacy along the way.  These issues hit all of
us when applying for credit, going to the doctor, applying for a job,
and even when making an 800 toll-free phone call.  For example, there
are companies providing computers to doctors' offices in exchange for
access to all of their records.  These problems are affecting
everyone, and are not esoteric technological issues.  I am committed
to protecting our privacy at home and on the job.

*       The computer networks criss-crossing our country are the
highways of tomorrow.  These networks are an 'online electronic
frontier' connecting such diverse groups as a Native American Tribal
school with an M.I.T. mathematics class.  The electronic frontier is a
new publishing medium, and a new 'place' of assembly raising many
issues of privacy and rights of free speech.  Online we can achieve
what political consultants want:  a way to get a message to many
people.  A key element of being online is that the people can also get
their message TO their representatives.  This technology affords us
the opportunity to discuss issues with our representatives.

*       We need ready access to information, especially flowing to and
from our government at all levels.  Information is power, and we the
people must recapture the power that should be ours.

Congressional Candidate Glenn Tenney Talks a Bit About Himself

MARCH 6, 1992, SAN MATEO, CALIFORNIA:  I've never had a desire to be a
career politician.  Apparently, few politicians in recent times have
carried a vision to Washington.  That's why I have decided to act on
my vision of our country's future in the twenty-first century by
working with you, as your representative in Washington.

My vision sees an information revolution that has already started and
will be as dramatic as was the industrial revolution.  We need
legislators who can truly understand future technologies and how to
use them to our advantage instead of having the technologies abuse us.
I take our future and my campaign seriously.  I am compelled to help
prepare our country for the next century even if that means becoming
an elected official and putting my career on hold.

I've been professionally involved in various aspects of technologies
(software and hardware) having begun operating system and compiler
design some 28 years ago, even before graduating high school.  I've
been "online" since then, being "hand's on" with technology having
designed and implemented many small and large systems as well as
having programmed on dozens of systems.  I've also researched and
written about technology, and about people's fears of technology.

I've been self-employed (or a "high-tech entrepreneur", depending on
how you want to view it) since I formed my own company in 1974.  Since
then I've been involved in a few Silicon Valley high-tech startups
including the very beginning of the personal computer industry, as
well as chip designs and a few others.

My company has been a "mom and pop" venture since Susan and I were
married in 1976.  I have two children and three step-children.  I grew
up in the Chicago area and moved to San Mateo county in 1972, raising
our children in San Mateo since 1976.  I turned 43 years old the day
after I announced my candidacy.

The following are some important aspects of who I am...

BA in Management (with honors), Saint Mary's College of California.

Senior Member of the Institute for Electrical and Electronic Engineers
(IEEE), and member of the IEEE Computer Society.

Participating Member, IEEE USA Intellectual Property Committee
(dealing with employed inventors rights, and copyright/patent issues
and legislation).

Member of the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM).

Chairperson and Organizer of The Hackers Conference (an annual
International high-tech conference) since it was originated by Stewart
Brand of The Whole Earth Catalog.

Member of the program and organizing committee of the first Conference
on Computers, Freedom and Privacy held last year.

Former Member of the Board of Trustees, Peninsula Temple Beth El.

Licensed Amateur Radio Operator (a "ham", callsign AA6ER).

Licensed Private Pilot (single engine land, instrument rated).

I've also been President of a variety of local computer and amateur
radio groups, and I am still involved with these groups and many other
organizations.

Subject: File 8-- BloomBecker's Legal Guidelines at CV&SC Conference (reprint)

 J.J. Buck BloomBecker, the director of the National Center for Computer
 Crime, called for the adoption of a new nationwide set of legal guide-
 lines concerning computer crime. BloomBecker, speaking at the 5th annual
 Computer Virus & Security Conference, proposed 5 points:

 1. The creation of a $200 crime law deductible. Damages incurred below
    that figure would not be the subject of criminal action.

 2. The creation of a civil course of action for inadequate computer
    security

 3. The making of reckless computing a felony. "Reckless computing" is
    classified as anything which could potentially cause damage.

 4. The making a careless computing a misdemeanor.

 5. The enactment of greater protection against unreasonable search and
    seizure.

 Bloombecker's recommendations and supporting statements were the subject
 of much conversation at his conference session. Donald Delaney, New York
 State Police Senior Investigator, decried the setting of a deductible
 for computer crime, pointing out that in the struggle against cellular
 phone call-selling operations, it is often an arrest for a single call
 under $200 that shuts down an on-going multi-thousand dollar fraud
 operation.

Subject: File 9-- NASA hacker sentenced (Reprint from RISKS DIGEST #13.29)

>From the 17 March 1992 _Rocky Mountain News_:

Hacker ordered to get mental help  (Reuter)

A computer hacker who pleaded guilty Monday to breaking into NASA
computer systems as ordered to undergo mental health treatment and not
use computers without permission from a probation officer.  Richard
Wittman, 24, of Lakewood [Colorado] was sentenced to three years
probation by Denver U.S. District Judge Sherman Finesilver in a rare
prosecution for breaking into a computer system.  Wittman pleaded
guilty last fall to one count of breaking into a National Aeronautics
and Space Administration computer.  Prosecutors said Wittman had spent
four years trying to get into computer systems.  In a plea bargain,
Wittman admitted gaining access to NASA's computer via a malfunction
in a bulletin board service.
