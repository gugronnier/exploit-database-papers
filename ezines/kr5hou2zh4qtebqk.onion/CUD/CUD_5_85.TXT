Subject: File 1--Electronic 'Zine List

((MODERATORS' NOTE: One of the most-often asked questions we receive

by John Labovitz (johnl@netcom.com), provides an continually-updated
collection of them. The updates are available via ftp from netcom.com

++++++++

Last updated: 9-Nov-93 by John Labovitz <johnl@netcom.com>

This is a summary of electronically-accessible zines.  The format of

WHAT IS A "ZINE"?

For those of you not acquainted with the zine world, "zine" is short for
either "fanzine" or "magazine," depending on your point of view.  Zines are
generally produced by one person or a small group of people, done often for
fun or personal reasons, and tend to be irreverent, bizarre, and/or esoteric.
Zines are not "mainstream" publications -- they generally do not contain
advertisements (except, sometimes, advertisements for other zines), do not
have a large subscriber base, and are generally not produced to make a profit.


FORMATS

Most e-zines listed here are in standard ASCII text format, which you can read
on just about any computer or terminal, and print on any printer.  A few are
available in PostScript for printing on a laser printer (or viewing on-screen
if you have a PostScript interpreter in your window system).  A small number
are available in some system-specific format (i.e., Macintosh HyperCard).


HOW DO I GET THE E-ZINES?

I have listed the various methods of access for each particular
e-zine.  Briefly, I use the following:

  FTP -- File Transfer Protocol
    Only accessible if you are directly on the Internet, or know of an
    FTP-mail server (I don't).  The host/pathname is given in the form
    (host:path) that certain FTPs (like NCFTP) can use directly; otherwise,
    you'd probably type "ftp host" and then "cd path" or some such.  All
    FTP sites listed accept anonymous logins (use "ftp" as username and your
    email address as password).

  E-Mail -- Electronic Mail
    You can usually request current or back issues via this address.
    Sometimes a site will run a mail server that automates some of this work.
    Instructions are listed, if applicable.

  Usenet -- Usenet News
    Only accessible if your site carries the specific Usenet group.

  Gopher
    Only accessible if your site is directly on the Internet.  Try typing
    "gopher".  If it works, you have a gopher client, and can usually type
    "gopher host".

  WWW -- World Wide Web
    Only accessible if your site is directly on the Internet, and supports a
    WWW-compatible hypertext browser.  Current browsers include www (ASCII
    line mode), lynx (ASCII full-screen mode), xmosaic (X Windows), Mac Mosaic
    (Macintosh), PC Mosaic (PC), Cello (PC), and probably a few others.

  Postal
    Last resort, or point of contact for zines that have paper editions.

  Phone
    Why?  I dunno; because it was there.

  CompuServe
    You know, that out-dated system that charges ridiculous rates.

  Other
    BBSes and other on-line systems the zine resides on.

Cropduster
 "Cropduster revolves, as perhaps everything does, around the substance that
  one calls pop-culture.   With various jargon thrown around including:
  post-modernism, nihilism, etc. in an attempt for one generation to
  understand the next, people forget what the essence of pop-culture really
  is -- a collection of somewhat useless artifacts which are given exceptional
  value by groups of people.  What we hope to show is not the trends but
  rather the idols of pop-culture.  We hope to convey the simplicity of
  everyday life through the icons which lead generation upon generation
  onwards."

Ego Project
 "This 'zine is a product of me and as such will contain anything I feel
  like putting in it.  Whatever I feel like putting in it shall include,
  but is not limited too, anything I feel applies to Gothdom in general.
  Album/single/tape reviews, book and movies reviews, etc. The Sisters of
  Mercy and the Mission are my main focuses, but since neither of them
  put out music on anything resembling a frequent basis I imagine other
  groups will be featured quite frequently."

 "FactSheet Five is the central clearinghouse of information about zines,

  Gunderloy of Rennsalaer, NY published 44 editions of F5.  Hudson Luce
  published issue #45.  Seth Friedman has published issue #46 onwards.

FUNHOUSE! -- The cyberzine of degenerate pop culture
 "Dedicated to whatever happens to be on my mind at the time I'm writing.
  The focus will tend to be on those aspects of our fun-filled world which
  aren't given the attention of the bland traditional media, or which have
  been woefully misinterpreted or misdiagnosed by the same.  FUNHOUSE! is
  basically a happy place, and thus the only real criteria I will try to
  meet is to refrain from rants, personal attacks, and flames -- and thus
  FUNHOUSE! is an apolitical place.  Offbeat films, music, literature, and
  experiences are largely covered, with the one stipulation that articles
  are attempted to be detailed and well documemnted, although this is no
  guarantee of completeness or correctness, so that the interested reader
  may further pursue something which may spark her interest."

Voices from the Net
 "There are a lot of folks with at least one foot in this complex region we
  call (much too simply) "the net." There are a lot of voices on these wires.
  From IRC to listservs, MUDspace to e-mail, Usenet group to commercial bbs
  -- all kinds of voices -- loud and quiet, anonymous and well-known. And yet,
  it's far from clear what it might mean to be a "voice" from, or on, the
  net. Enter "Voices from the Net": one attempt to sample, explore, the
  possibilities (or perils) of net.voices. Worrying away at the question.
  Running down the meme. Looking/listening, and reporting back to you."

Whole Earth Review
 "We are dedicated to demystification, to self-teaching, and to
  encouraging people to think for themselves.  Thus our motto: 'ACCESS TO
  TOOLS AND IDEAS.'  Tools in the Whole Earth sense include hammers, books,
  and computer conferencing systems.  Our readers are a community of
  tool-users who share information with one another.  The ideas we make
  accessible have not often been found in university courses, but are
  becoming recognized as part of what you need to know to be truly educated.
  Our readers contribute to the editorial content as well, with both reviews
  and articles."
