Newmail Problems
++++++++++++

There appear to be mailer problems somewhere along the lines.  CuD
3.13 was re-sent because of some garbling problems; CuD 3.14 went out
of NIU with no problem and we received few bounces, but apparently
that issue was gobbled up and only a few received it.  A significant
number of 3.15s were returned because they could not sneak through a
particular gateway. If you are not receiving CuD within a few days of
the pub date in the header, let us know.

+++++++++++++
CuD's Old News
+++++++++++++

We are occasionally asked why we print "old news" that has been
circulated on the nets for awhile.  A recent Usenet survey of all
newsgroup use estimates that CuD reaches about 9,300 through usenet.
Relatively few sites (210) make CuD available to their users, so the
readers-per-site matches that of more-established on-line journals
such as RISKS and our progenitor TELECOM-DIGEST. In addition to a
mailing list of about 700, we immediately reach about 10,000 with each
posting.  However, we have about 30 additional non-usenet feeds, and
other readers obtain CuD from GEnie, Compuserve, and hundreds of BBSs,
including two of the largest in the country (PC-EXEC and AV-SYNC).  We
also send out various back issues to about a dozen people each month
who do not subscribe but simply want specific information.  This means
that, for perhaps one third of the readers, CuD may be the only source
of news, so what is "old" to most of us fills in gaps for others. We
try to assure that those without net access are provided with the
basics of stories covered in other digests (thus our policy of
reprinting old material) and hard-copy media.  Further, some of the
posts we print are sent to several other outlets simultaneously, and
sometimes hold these for a week or two prior to publishing.  For those
who find these stories stale, we apologize, but the feedback from
those who are, believe it or not, only now hearing about Sun Devil
indicates that, for better or worse, some dated coverage is necessary.
So, thanks for not complaining too much.

+++++++++++
Prodigy
+++++++++++

This issue focuses on the problems of Prodigy. As most know by now,
Prodigy was criticized last year for apparent censorship and what some
felt was high-handed treatment of customers complaining first about
Prodigy's billing practices, and next about Prodigy's response to
those who complained to other Prodigy users through E-mail. Another
problem has arisen. It seems that Prodigy's user-interface, Stage.dat,
appears to include bits of private data from users' other files.
Thanks to all those who have sent us material. We have selected the
most comprehensive to summarize the current brouhaha.
