Informants, etc

There will be more information on the Secret Service's use of informants
and the extent to which they were employed in forth-coming issues. CuD will
be making several FOIA requests in an attempt to gather more information.
A future issue will be devoted to how individuals can help in protecting
Constitutional freedoms related to computer communication.

Article Format
++++++++++++++++++++

We've been receiving an increasing number responses using software that
auto-cites. *PLEASE* don't quote long lines of texts if they are not
relevant to your article. Also, make sure that that attribution of
authorship goes to the proper person (as in "josie blowsie writes:") rather
than to the CuD editors (unless we in fact wrote it). Most editors are
picking up the "jut2" line, especially in the mailbag file.  In long
articles, it helps to have a blank space between each paragraph and to
avoid odd or unprintable characters which some systems have difficulty
reading.

HACK-TIC Magazine
++++++++++++++++

We received our first copy of HACK-TIC, a CU periodical from Amsterdam. We
don't read Dutch, so we tried to wing it from German. The size and layout
are similar to 2600. We received Issue 11-12 (47 pages), which contains
technical information, articles on the E911/PHRACK trial, Milnet, Cartoons,
and other news from Europe. There is enough substance that one need not
speak Dutch to get a decent value from picking up the stray bits in English
(such as a decoder program for Wordperfect files).

For those wanting more information, write to:

  UUCP = ropg@ooc.uva.nl

Individuals issues cost about $2.30 each, (4 G) and a subscription of
 10 issues costs about $21.75 (37.5 G).

CuD (and other text files) are available on FIDOnet through Mike Bateman's
system:

1:100/345 for those on FIDOnet
8:921/910 for those on RBBSnet
65:221/4  for those on OURnet
43:555/203 for those on V-NET

To access various files, simply send a file request to Mike's system for the
magic filename CUD.  This will send out the current listing of archive
files held here.  From there it's up to callers to request what they
want.

The system is available 24hours a day, IS PCP Pursuitable (even though the
list doesn't reflect that yet due to his area code being very new).
For questions or problems, drop a note to:
SMBATEM@UMSLVMA.bitnet

PC Pusuitable at MOSLO, and supports 1200, 2400 9600, and 14400 connects,
both HST and v32.
