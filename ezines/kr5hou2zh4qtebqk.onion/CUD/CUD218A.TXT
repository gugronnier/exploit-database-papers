FTP Files
+++++++++++++++++++++

The FTP archives are steadily growing. They include Network Information
Access (NIA), a few new CU magazines, and a variety of computer crime
statutes (state, federal, foreign), and a few new papers written by law
students and attorneys. Thanks to all those who send material along. If you
submit a long paper (20 pages or more), please be sure the format is
complete (biblio and footnotes not excluded if cited in the text) and line
length is not over 80 characters per line. Papers should be of publishable
quality and not simply stream-of-consciousness opinion. If you're not sure
if your paper is appropriate, send it along anyway. Papers should be timely
or of historical/archival value, and not something you happened across on a
BBS somewhere that is dated.
