***************************************************************

Mike Godwin's summary of Title 18 USC %section% 1343 raises a curious
point. Count two of Craig Neidorf's new indictment charges that the:

      ....defendant herein, for the purposes of executing the aforesaid
      scheme did knowingly transmit and cause to be transmitted by means
      of a wire and radio communication in interstate commerce from
      Columbia, Missouri to Lockport, Illinois certain signs, signals and
      sounds, namely:  a data transfer of Phrack World News announcing the
      beginning of the "Phoenix Project";
           In violation of Title 18, United States Code, Section 1343

One wonders what such a document could contain that it would subject the
offender to up to five years in prison and up to a $1,000 fine. Surely it
must contain some dangerous information to warrant a separate count.  We
took a look at this file, and here it is, reprinted directly from the
original:

Just what is "The Phoenix Project?"

Definition:  Phoenix (fe/niks), n.  A unique mythical bird of great beauty
                     fabled to live 500 or 600 years, to burn itself to death,
                     and to rise from its ashes in the freshness of youth, and
                     live through another life cycle.

             Project (proj/ekt), n.  Something that is contemplated, devised,
                     or planned.  A large or major undertaking.  A long term
                     assignment.

Why is "The Phoenix Project?"

On June 1, 1987 Metal Shop Private went down seemingly forever with no
possible return in sight, but the ideals and the community that formed the
famous center of learning lived on.  On June 19-21, 1987 the phreak/hack world
experienced SummerCon'87, an event that brought much of the community together
whether physically appearing at the convention or in spirit.  On July 22, 1987
the phreak/hack community was devastated by a nationwide attack from all forms
of security and law enforcement agencies...thus setting in motion the end of
the community as we knew it.  Despite the events of July 22, 1987, PartyCon'87
was held on schedule on July 26-28, 1987 as the apparent final gathering of
the continent's last remaining free hackers, unknown to them the world they
sought to protect was already obliterated.  As of August 1, 1987 all of the
original members and staff of the Metal Shop Triad and Phrack Inc. had decided
to bail out in the hopes that they could return one day when all would be as
before...

                             THAT DAY HAS COME...

A new millennium is beginning and it all starts on July 22, 1988.  How fitting
that the One year anniversary of the destruction of the phreak/hack community
should coincidentally serve as the day of its rebirth.

Announcing SummerCon '88 in (where else would you expect) St. Louis, Missouri!

Knowledge is the key to the future and it is FREE.  The telecommunications and
security industries can no longer withhold the right to learn, the right to
explore, or the right to have knowledge.  The new age is here and with the use
of every *LEGAL* means available, the youth of today will be able to teach the
youth of tomorrow.

SummerCon'88 is a celebration of a new beginning.  Preparations are currently
underway to make this year's convention twice as fun as last year's and the
greater the turnout the greater the convention shall be.  No one is directly
excluded from the festivities and the practice of passing illegal information
is not a part of this convention (contrary to the opinions of the San
Francisco Examiner, and they weren't even at the last one).  Anyone interested
in appearing at this year's convention should leave mail to Crimson Death
immediately so we can better plan the convention for the correct amount of
participants.

The hotel rooms purchased for SummerCon'88 are for the specified use of
invited guests and no one else.  Any security consultants or members of law
enforcement agencies that wish to attend should contact the organizing
committee as soon as possible to obtain an invitation to the actual convention
itself.

Sorry for the short notice this year...

That's it.  This file provides a few standard dictionary definitions,
announces a past and forthcoming conference, and invites security personnel
to attend. Yet, the meanings proferred by the indictment suggest this
announcement reflects something far more insidious, something criminal, and
something in dire need of prosecution.

The issues are not whether the file reflects poor judgment or a vocabulary
that some find inappropriate. Our increasing worry is this: Is this file so
dangerous that its publication warrants an indictment that subjects a young
defendant to up to five years in prison? Does this file, by any reasonable
standard, meet the good faith standards for prosecution outlined in Section
1343?  The more we follow the Secret Service activities and U.S. Attorney
William J. Cook's handling of the trial, the more we question the motives
and procedures of the investigators and prosecutors.  If those who abuse
the computer system violate the trust of other computer users, as argued by
prosecutors, then those who would seem to abuse the fundamental law of the
land by apparently violating First and Fourth Amendment rights and by
seemingly abusing federal statutes to obtain a prosecution violate
something even more sacred: THE SPIRIT OF JUSTICE AND THE RULE OF LAW!
Those convicted of violating a federal statute face serious consequences.
Those who abuse federal statutes can enhance careers.  Is the statute being
abused? Have we read the law, the indictment, and the file correctly? How
do others read it?

Yes, there are other charges against Craig Neidorf. But, again, as we read
both the indictment and the law, there is a curious twist of language that
distorts his behavior and translates it into something quite different than
it was. We do not argue that accessing other computers is acceptable, and
we do not claim that any person has a "right" to access information
surreptitiously.  However, this isn't the point. If this file constitutes a
"crime," then it would seem to strike at the heart of freedom of speech.

Computer technology is changing the way we communicate. The Constitutional
protections (or lack of them) decided now will shape the status of
electronic communication in the coming decades. We do not see this as a
"hacking" issue, but as an issue the will affect all computerists who
communicate across the wired for many years.
