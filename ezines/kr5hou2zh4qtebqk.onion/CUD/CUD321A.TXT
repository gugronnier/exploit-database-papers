A few quick notes:

CuDs ON COMPUSERVE:  Back issues of Computer Underground Digest on
CompuServe can be found in these forums:

		IBMBBS, DL0 (new uploads) and DL4 (BBS Management)
		LAWSIG, DL1 (Computer Law)
		TELECOM, DL0 (New Uploads) and DL12 (Electronic Frontier)

Issues in the IBMBBS and LAWSIG libraries are binary files that can be
extracted using recent versions of ARC or ARC-compatible programs.
The issues uploaded to TELECOM have thus far been ASCII text that can
be read on-line or downloaded.  Thanks to Scott Loftesness for
uploading the issues to TELECOM.  Special thanks to Bob Izenberg who
sent this information along to us and has been meticulously diligent
in keeping Compuserve files current.

PAPER ON THE CU: Back in February, The Butler passed along to us his
paper on THE COMPUTER UNDERGROUND. We intended to publish it, but
because of the size, we haven't yet had the chance. So, we've made it
available in the ftp cites. If you do not have ftp access, let us know
and we'll send a copy via bitnet.
