Subject: Stormin Norman hacked?
From: Bob Izenberg <dogface!bei@CS.UTEXAS.EDU>
Date: Wed, 13 Mar 91 07:19:51 CST

All Things Considered quoted a London Times article about an aide to
Norman "Stormin' Norman" Schwartzkopf (sp?), the general in charge of
a recent spate of calisthenics that may have made the headlines. ;-)
The aide's PC, with some US battle plans on it, was stolen out of his
car, and anonymously returned three weeks later.  The NPR report
quoted the Times article as saying that authorities were satisfied
that the info on the portable's disk(s) never got into Iraqi hands, or
computers.  If only it was a telco employee's computer!  Then we'd
have somebody's balls on a platter already.

Subject: Some Comments on Computer Fraud Enforcement
Date: Sat, 17 Mar 91 05:17:49 GMT

>From pages 9-11 of "Credit Card and Computer Fraud" dated August 1988
published by the Department of the Treasury, United States Secret
Service:

Computer Fraud

Computer crimes have emerged as a major concern for law enforcement in
recent years.  Victims of computer crimes have sustained substantial
losses, inconveniences, and even anxiety over the damage to their
credit reputation.  Some businesses, including small long-distance
telephone companies, have gone bankrupt as a direct result of computer
fraud losses.  In 1986, Congress revised Title 18 of the United States
Code, Section 1030, empowering the Secret Service, among other Federal
law enforcement agencies, to investigate fraud and related activities
in connection with "Federal-Interest computers."

     The law prohibits anyone from:

[_] Knowingly accessing a computer to obtain certain information
    protected for reasons of national security with intent to injure
    the United States;

[_] Intentionally accessing a computer to obtain, without authorization,
    information from a financial record of a financial institution;

[_] Intentionally accessing a computer used for the exclusive use of the
    United States Government;

[_] Intentionally accessing a computer to affect, without authorization,
    the government's use of any computer that is used by the United
    States Government;

[_] Knowingly and intentionally accessing a Federal interest computer
    to fraudulently obtain anything of value other than the use of the
    computer;

[_] Intentionally accessing a Federal interest computer to alter,
    damage, or destroy information, or prevent authorized use of any
    such computer, and thereby:

       a. cause a loss of $1,000 or more; or

       b. modify or impair a medical examination, medical diagnosis,
          medical treatment, or the medical care of an individual; or

[_] Knowingly and intentionally accessing a computer to trafic in any
    password through which a computer can be accessed without
    authorization, where such trafficking affects interstate or
    foreign commerce, or such computer is used by or for the
    Government of the United States.

The Secret Service maintains a group of highly trained computer
specialists who participate in the investigation of computer fraud
cases.  Although the U.S. Secret Service is pioneering new law
enforcement techniques in the identification and apprehension of
computer criminals, the task of combating computer crime is not ours
alone.  The burden of responsibility for information and data security
rests not only with law enforcement authorities, but also with the
owners and operators of the computer systems who may, potentially,
fall victim to computer fraud.

Mike's post leaves one perplexed about what it's doing in CUD? Perhaps
he could explain the relevance of this item to CU-related issues?

Further, one tends to be left even more perplexed about Mike's
assertion that the Michigan bill he describes "specifically seeks to
overturn the MFJ." Now that's really quite a mouthful. But it's not
disgesti. How does Mike think a Michigan bill could bring this about,
one wonders?

Peter de Silva is right on this one; it was not exactly a near-optimal
outcome, and for the reasons he notes, among others.

On the other hand, where's the capability to "watch the various PUCs like
a hawk"? Might be a tall order, methinks.

Subject: Hacking and Breaking and Entering
Date: Mon, 18 Mar 91 11:22:14 PST

I've been reading a lot of posts that compare hacking to breaking and
entering and wonder what CuD readers and editors think? I don't think
the two are comparable. Breaking and entering is a type of violent
crime and it physically destroys property. Sure, hacking might destroy
data, but this doesn't happen much, which doesn't mean it's right, but
that the two type of destruction aren't the same. A home is a private
place and the type of privacy is different that the privacy of a
computer. You can't curl up inside the computer and make love, retreat
to its hard drives from the pressures of the outside world in the same
way you do to the tv room, or make a sandwich.  But it seems that the
penalties for computer hacking are as severe as for breaking and
entering. I just don't get it.

Subject: Response to Washington Post Article on Len Rose
Date: Tue, 26 Mar 91 08:46:30 EST

{Moderators' note: See File 5 of this issue for the Post piece.}
The most intriguing part for me, was the way the Washington Post
release made it sound like Mr. Rose's modified version of the login
program was in itself inherently illegal. Even months after people
complained about how blatantly uninformed making such a suggestion is,
it persists and has taken a higher form. Had this case veered even one
tenth of a degree from where it ended up, it could've set a rather
dangerous precedent.

It was a surprise when I read that Rose pleaded guilty .. and how
quietly the trial took place. With the play it got earlier (Unix
Today, etc) this year and last, the volume certainly did get lowered.

Perhaps now Mr. Rose can get on with his life.

Subject: Indianapolis is now PC-Pursuitable
Date: Wed, 20 Mar 91 13:57:11 CST

                INDIANAPOLIS IS NOW PC-PURSUITABLE

After years of promises, Telenet's (SprintNet's) PC-Pursuit service,
also known as PCP, has finally installed outdials in Indianapolis.
The official announcement from Telenet is still forthcoming, but the
outdials are in place.

Indy's semi-official BBS list comes from the IUPUI BBoard, and is
maintained by sysop Don Smith.  This file can be file requested from
most of net 231's FidoNet boards as file INDY0301.ZIP.

The latest version contains 96 local boards.  However, taking all the
multi-line boards into account, we have over 150 BBS lines!

Some of the multi-line boards of note are: PBS-BBS (Public Brand
Software) 317-856-2087, noted for its shareware; Data Central
317-543-2007, files and GIFs; User's Choice 317-894-1378, GIFs; and
L.C. Midwest 317-924-2219, a dating/adult board.  Those are pay
boards.  Most other boards are free.

Indy is also Telelink/Starlink node 9349.  Some people feel that
Starlink is a better service than PC-Pursuit.

Assuming that the outdial is in the same exchange as PCP's indial, the
following exchanges should be accessible according to Indiana Bell's
white pages.  I include this list for your convenience because PCP has
not yet published an official XCH list. Please excuse any typos or
errors.  These exchanges include Indianapolis proper, Carmel,
Zionsville, Noblesville, Speedway, Beech Grove, Greenwood, Plainfield,
Brownsburg, Fishers, Greenfield, Mooresville, and New Palestine.

Subject: L'Accused--a bust is a bust is a bust....
Date: Mon, 18 Mar 91 00:26:24 CST

I ran across an interesting article in the January 29th, 1991 issue of
the Village Voice.  The author is Elizabeth Hess.  I've included the
relevant parts and omitted references to particular art galleries that
were showing Sturges' work at the time.

The general topic, that of a U.S. citizen penalized without trial or,
even now, indictment or charges filed, may be familiar to CUD readers.
(article excerpt follows)

>From the 1-29-91 Village Voice article, "The Accused", by Elizabeth
Hess:  The opening of an exhibition of photographs by Jock Sturges
would not ordinarily be news.  But Sturges, as readers might recall,
is currently under investigation for producing child pornography.
Last April, members of the San Francisco police and the FBI entered
the photographer's home, without a warrant, after receiving a tip from
a local film processor (The Village Voice, June 12, 1990).  Later that
afternoon, a warrant was obtained and the officers carted off an
estimated 1 million negatives, various pieces of darkroom and computer
equipment, several business and personal files, eight address books,
and a few cameras belonging to one terrified Jock Sturges.  His life
was impounded.

Nine months have passed and the photographer has still not been
charged with any crime, not have all of his belongings been returned.
And, even more insidious, the FBI has launched an international
investigation into the artist's work and personal life.  While the art
world, especially in San Francisco, has rallied around the case,
Sturges says he has lost a show, friends, models, and jobs.

On November 21, Michael Metzger, Sturges' attorney, filed a motion in
the U.S. District Court in San Francisco for the return of the
photographer's property; a hearing is scheduled for February 7.
Sturges intends to follow up with a civil suit, seeking damages
against local and federal authorities.  Meanwhile, the photographer is
also bringing his case to the public, traveling around the country in
an effort to raise money and political support.  [ lines on gallery
exhibits skipped ]

The artist's career was probably going at its proper pace prior to the
totally unjustified, if not illegal, invasion into his privacy.  It's
hard to say how bad the authorities want Jock Sturges,  They have
certainly been putting a great deal of effort into an investigation of
the folks listed in his address books. According to Sturges, the
French police have visited and questioned every person who appears in
his current Philadelphia exhibition and others:  a total of 46
families.

American authorities have also been busy making sure that people think
twice before modeling in the nude for Sturges, or anybody else.
According to the Philadelphia Inquirer Magazine, the FBI went to visit
a family in California that included a 13-year old daughter whom
Sturges has been shooting for the past eight years.  During the
interview, one of the agents turned to the young girl and asked, "Does
this guy ever ask you to spread your legs?"  Prior to this moment, no
one in the family had ever been embarrassed by the photographs.  The
daughter recently hid her copies in a trunk.

"The FBI has been instructing people in shame." says Sturges.  "A
visit from the police is traumatizing, and it has a chilling effect.~
Even Sturges recently wrapped a few bodies in towels before shooting
them on the beach.

{Moderator's note: We view this article as *directly* relevant to
the CU for two reasons. First, it suggests how similar policies
are filtered through different laws for the same result.
The scenario between Sturges' experience and that of Steve Jackson
and other is analogous: Media (whether computers or art) that Feds
barely understand provides a context for identifying somebody
who *appears* (in Fed-think) to be in violation of some heinous
"crime of the week." The Feds swoop in, bust them and grab whatever
equipment looks suspicious (substitute "computers" for "cameras,"
or "disks" for "negatives"). The second point is that the CU should
be alert to apparent excessive zealousness in the non-computer world,
because prosecutors' behavior seems, like cancer, to have a habit
of spreading. In a recent federal drug bust on a Southeastern
college fraternity, three fraternity houses were seized by the
government because a few members were caught with drugs. This
absurdity is reminiscent of J. Cousteau's yacht, The Calypso, being
seized a few years ago because a crew member was found with a
"roach" in his cabin. Federal agents and their supporters will
argue for the necessity of such action, but in a free society,
such seizures--which resemble tyrannies rather than
democracies--affect us all. These are ALL CU issues.
