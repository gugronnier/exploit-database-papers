***************************************************************

We still do not have an FTP site for archives, although we have
several volunteers if we cannot ultimately set one up here.
When we have one, we will permantely post it in the header.

If you have not received back issues of CuD but have requested to
be placed on the mailing list, re-send your request, and manually
include your address in your signature. The biggest problems seem to
be those addresses for which we must rely on the headers. BITNET is
preferred.

We are especially looking to build the archives with research
papers, such as those presented at conferences, or published
articles for which authors retain copyright. AGAIN WE CAUTION--
PLEASE BE SURE THERE ARE NO COPYRIGHT VIOLATIONS, or we cannot
post the articles. Even if an author writes and contributes a piece,
if it has been published in an academic journal, the journal
normally retains the copyright. However, because most papers are
first presented at a conference, and because the final product
usually contains substantial revisions, conference papers, or
book chapters on which the author retains copyright, are
acceptable. Same goes for newspaper articles or transcripts of
radio or tv broadcasts. So, send those articles, but if in doubt,
err on the side of caution! We will not knowingly distribute
anything that violates this or any other laws.

We are starting to put together a bibliography listing books and research
articles on the computer underground. If you come across any journals,
books, or feature-length articles (not simply news blurbs), please pass
along the *complete* reference and preferably a summary (or, better, a
review/critique) we can publish.

NOTE: WE WILL BE AT A CONFERENCE FROM WEDS, APRIL 11 THRU SUNDAY APRIL 15,
AND WILL NOT BE ANSWERING ANY MAIL UNTIL MONDAY, APRIL 16. Issue #1.04 will
be lengthy--about 2,100 lines. It will go out Monday, April 16, and will be
broken down into four (4) individual files of about 500 lines each.
