6.6  BOUNDARY FORMATION PROCESS AND THE USE OF ANALOGIES

 The previous sections of this chapter have established that the ethical
 issues surrounding computer usage are both complex and liable to
 fundamentally contrasting interpretations by the members of the CSI and the
 CU.  The debate that subsequently occurs between the two groups has been
 shown as part of a boundary forming process by means of which both groups
 reinforce their own identities.  This section analyses the way in which
 analogies are used within this process as both explanatory tools with which
 to examine some of the issues in the ethical debate over hacking, and also
 as a method of conveying the strength of opinion that is held.
 The role of physical analogies in the ethical debate over security issues
 has already been illustrated with the CSI's use of them to express fears of
 the anonymous nature of the threat hackers pose.  The general ease with
 which physical analogies are used and the strength of feeling behind them
 is vividly illustrated by Jerry Carlin's response to the question, ''Have
 system breakers become the 'whipping boys' for general commercial
 irresponsibility with regard to data security?"  He replied, "It's
 fashionable to blame the victim for the crime but if someone is raped it is
 not OK to blame that person for not doing a better job in fending off the
 attack!" (Carlin: e-mail interview)  Sherizen was one of the few
 interviewees to refrain from using analogies in his discussion of hacking,
 contending that:

Usually, arguing by analogy is a very weak argument.  When it comes to
 discussing the law, non-lawyers often try to approach arguments this way.
 I don't think that we can go very far to determine appropriate behaviours
 if we rely upon analogies.  What we need to develop are some social
 definitions of acceptable behaviour and then to structure "old law for new
 technologies."  The physical analogies may help to score points in a debate
 but they are not helpful here at all (Sherizen e-mail interview).

 The grey and indeterminate ethical quality of computing makes it difficult
 to establish such a code of 'acceptable behaviour', and it is in an attempt
 to do so that physical analogies are used.  Goldstein (editor of Hacking
 magazine 'Phrack') explores the ethical implications of hacking by
 questioning the use of an analogy that likens hacking to trespass:

Some will say ... 'accessing a computer is far more sensitive than walking
 into an unlocked office building.'  If that is the case, why is it still so
 easy to do?  If it's possible for somebody to easily gain unauthorised
 access to a computer that has information about me, I would like to know
 about it.  But somehow I don't think the company or agency running the
 system would tell me that they have gaping security holes.  Hackers, on the
 other hand, are very open about what they discover which is why large
 corporations hate them so much (Goldstein 1993).

 The moral debate about hacking makes frequent use of such physical
 analogies of 'theft' and 'trespass'.  The choice of the physical analogy
 reflecting the initial ethical position of the discussant and will be
 biased towards the point that the discussant is attempting to establish,
 and hence certain emotive images such as rape and burglary are repeatedly
 used.





(i) Property issues

 Members of the CSI tend to emphasise the authorisation and access rights
 criteria relating to information.  Such criteria are held to be fundamental
 to an ethical outlook on computing issues because of they stem from the
 basic belief that information and computer systems are the sole property of
 their owners, in the same way that property rights exist in material
 objects.  Physical analogies become a means to restrict the computer
 security debate: "to questions about privacy, property, possessive
 individualism, and at best, the excesses of state surveillance, while it
 closes off any examination of the activities of the corporate owners and
 institutional sponsors of information technology (the most prized 'target'
 of most hackers)." (Ross 1990: 83).  This is a rather partisan
 interpretation of the role analogies play in the socially shaping boundary
 formation occurring within computing.  A less controversial assessment,
 would be that in contrast to the CU, the CSI emphasises the property rights
 of system owners with its use of analogies  that are often dramatic and
 vivid: "As far as the raison d'=88tre for attackers, it is no more a valid
 justification to attack systems because they are vulnerable than it is
 valid to beat up babies because they can't defend themselves.  If you are
 going to demonstrate a weakness, you must do it with the permission of the
 systems administrators and with a great deal of care" (Cohen: e-mail
 interview).
 The difficulty faced with analogies that seek to emphasise the way in which
 hacking tends to transgress property rights, centres upon what we have
 already seen as the increasingly immaterial aspects of information and
 which is also shown in Chapter 7 to create various problems for drafting
 effective computer misuse legislation: "copyability is INHERENT in
 electronic media.  You can xerox a book but not very well and you don't get
 a nice binding and cover.  Electronic media, video tape, computer discs
 etc., do not have this limitation.  Since the ability to copy is within the
 nature of the media, it seems silly to try to prevent it" (Mercury: e-mail
 interview).  Software copying is an example of how duplication within
 computing  is inherently more easy than with physical commodities:
 copyability is intrinsic to the medium itself.  For example, Maelstrom
 contends that he: "can't remember a single analogy that works.  Theft is
 taking something else that belongs to someone without his/her permission.
 When you pirate you don't steal, you copy" (Maelstrom: e-mail interview).
 Similarly, in the case of cracking:

In absolutely no case can the physical analogies of 'theft' and
 'trespassing' be applied in the matter of computer system 'cracking'.
 Computers are a reservoir for information expressed in bits of zeroes and
 ones.  Homes and property have things far more intrinsically valuable to
 harbour.  Information protected properly whilst residing on a system is not
 at issue for 'theft'.  Encryption should have been a standard feature to
 begin with and truly confidential information should not be accessible in
 any manner via a remote means (Tester: e-mail interview).


(ii) Analogies - breaking and entering

 In order to emphasise the potential harm threatened to systems by anonymous
 intruders the physical analogies used tend to concentrate upon the fear and
 sense of violation that tend to accompany burglaries.  The dispute between
 the CSI and the CU as to whether it is ethical to break into systems is
 most often conducted with reference to the analogy of breaking and entering
 into a building.  Because of the divergence between the real world and
 cyberspace, however, even such a simple analogy is open to varying
 interpretations:  "My analogy is walking into an office building, asking a
 secretary which way it is to the records room, and making some Xerox copies
 of them.  Far different than breaking and entering someone's home" (Cohen:
 e-mail interview).
  Cosell presents the following scenario with which he attempts to frame the
 ethical issues surrounding hacking:

Consider: it is the middle of summer and you happen to be climbing in the
 mountains and see a pack of teenagers roaming around an
 abandoned-until-snow ski resort.  There is no question of physical harm to
 a person, since there will be no people around for months.  They are
 methodically searching EVERY truck, building, outbuilding, shed etc.,
 trying EVERY window, trying to pick EVERY lock.  When they find something
 they can open, they wander into it, and emerge a while later.  From your
 vantage point, you can see no actual evidence of any theft or vandalism,
 but then you can't actually see what they're doing while they're inside
 whatever-it-is (Cosell: CuD 3:12 April 1991).

 From this scenario, various questions arise, such as: do you call the
 Police? what would the intruders be charged with?  and would your response
 be different if you were the owner of the resort?  Someone more sympathetic
 to the hacker point of view illustrated the fundamentally different way in
 which the two groups, CSI and CU, conceptualise the ethical issues and the
 corresponding use of physical analogies.  He responded that:

Of course you should call the cops.  Unless they are authorised to be on the
 property, (by the owner) they are trespassing, and in the case of picking
 locks, breaking and entering.  However, you're trying to equate breaking
 into a ski resort with breaking into a computer system.  The difference
 being: 99 times out of 100, the people breaking into a computer system only
 want to learn, have forgotten a password, etc. ... 99 times out of 100, the
 people breaking into the ski resort are out for free shit (Rob Heins CuD
 3:13).

 The CU accuse the CSI of preferring to use physical analogies in order to
 marginalise a group, rather than make use of their information for
 improving the security of systems:

When you refer to hacking as 'burglary and theft' ... it becomes easy to
 think of these people as hardened criminals.  But it's just not the case.
 I don't know any burglars or thieves, yet I hang out with an awful lot of
 hackers.  It serves a definite purpose to blur the distinction, just as
 pro-democracy demonstrators are referred to as rioters by nervous political
 leaders.  Those who have staked a claim in the industry fear that the
 hackers will reveal vulnerabilities in their systems that they would just
 as soon forget about (Emmanuel Goldstein: CuD 1:13).

  This is one explanation of why, if physical analogies are inevitably only
 crude analytical approximations and rhetorical devices with which to
 conceptualise computing issues, they are frequently used by the CSI in
 their discourse.  Johnson argues in response to the claim that hackers
 serve a useful purpose by pointing out security faults that:

If a policeman walks down the street testing doors to see if they are
 locked, that's within his 'charter'- both ethically and legally.  If one is
 open, he is within the same 'charter' to investigate - to see if someone
 else is trespassing.  However, it's not in his 'charter' to go inside and
 snoop through my personal belongings, nor to hunt for illegal materials
 such as firearms or drugs ... If I come home and find the policeman in my
 house, I can pretty well assume he's doing me a favour because he found my
 door unlocked.  However, if a self-appointed 'neighbourhood watch' monitor
 decides to walk down the street checking doorknobs, he's probably
 overstepped his 'charter'.  If he finds my door unlocked and enters the
 house, he's trespassing ... Life is complicated enough without
 self-appointed watchdogs and messiahs trying to 'make my life safe (Bob
 Johnson: e-mail interview).

 Thus, hackers are seen to have no 'charter' which justifies their
 incursions into other peoples' systems, such incursions being labelled as
 trespass.  Even comparisons to trespass, however, tend to be too limited
 for those wishing to identify and label hacking as an immoral act.
 Trespass is a civil and not a criminal offence.  Onderwater, makes this
 distinction with his particular use of analogies:  "Trespassing means in
 Holland if somebody leaves the door open and the guy goes in, stands in the
 living room, crosses his arms and doesn't do anything."  In contrast,
 hacking involves the active overcoming of any security measures put before
 hackers, Onderwater sees it as more analagous to the situation whereby:

you find somebody in your house and he is looking through your clothes in
 your sleeping room, and you say 'what are you doing?' and he says 'well, I
 was walking at the back of the garden and I saw that if I could get onto
 the shed of your neighbour, there was a possibility to get onto the gutter,
 and could get to your bathroom window, get it open, that was a mistake from
 you, so I'd like to warn you ... You wouldn't see that as trespassing, you
 would see that as breaking and entering, which it is and I think it's the
 same with hacking (Onderwater: Hague interview).


(iii) Rejection of breaking and entering analogies - hackers use of
  physical analogies: chess vs breaking and entering

 Gongrijp's description of the motives lying behind hacking was typical of
 the hackers I met.  He concentrated on the intellectual stimulation it
 affords as opposed to any desire just to trespass onto computer systems .
 He emphasised the chess-like qualities of computer security, and was at
 pains to reject any analogies that might compare hacking to physical
 breaking and entering.   Gongrijp contended that:

Computer security is like a chess-game, and all these people that say
 breaking into my computer systems is like breaking into my house:
 bull-shit, because securing your house is a very simple thing, you just put
 locks on the doors and bars on the windows and then only brute force can
 get into your house, like smashing a window.  But a computer has a hundred
 thousand intricate ways to get in, and it's a chess game with the people
 that secure a computer... it's their job to make the new release of their
 Unix system more secure, and it's the job of the hackers to break in
 (Gongrijp: Amsterdam interview).

 Goggans turns the burglar analogy on its head when he argues that:

People just can't seem to grasp the fact that a group of 20 year old kids
 just might know a little more than they do, and rather than make good use
 of us, they would rather just lock us away and keep on letting things pass
 them by ... you can't stop burglars from robbing you when you leave the
 doors open, but lock up the people who can close them for you, another
 burglar will just walk right in (Goggans 1990).

 The implication of these combined views, is that the analogy comparing
 hacking with burglary fails because the real world barriers employed to
 deter burglars are not used in the virtual world of computing.  Such
 preventative measures are either not used at all, or are of a qualitatively
 different kind to the 'doors' and 'locks' that can be used in computing.
 Such barriers can be overcome by technologically knowledgeable young
 people, without violence or physical force of any kind.  The overcoming of
 such barriers, has a non-violent and intellectual quality that is not
 apparent in more conventional forms of burglary, and which therefore throws
 into question the whole suitability of such analogies.

(iv)  Problems of using physical analogies as explanatory tools

 The following excerpt is a newspaper editorial response to the acquittal of
 Paul Bedworth case.  It compares computer addiction to a physical addiction
 for drugs:

This must surely be a perverse verdict ... Far from being unusual in staying
 up half the night, Mr Bedworth was just doing what his fellows have done
 for years.  Scores of universities and private companies could each produce
 a dozen software nerds as dedicated as he ... Few juries in drug cases look
 so indulgently on the mixture of youth and addiction (Ind 18.3.93:
 editorial p. 25).

 This editorial emphasises how such analogies are utilised in an attempt to
 formulate ethical responses to an activity of ambiguous ethical content.
 As Goldstein pointed out, it becomes easier to attribute malign intent, if
 using such analogies succeeds in making a convincing comparison between
 hacking and an activity the public are more readily inclined to construe as
 a malicious activity.  The adaptability of this technique is shown by the
 way the editorial continues to utilise a physical analogy in order to
 elicit critical responses, this time against the victims of the previously
 maligned hacker: "Leaving those passwords unchanged is like leaving the
 chief executive's filing cabinet un-locked.  Organisations that do so can
 expect little public sympathy when their innermost secrets are brought into
 public view."
 The main reason why physical analogies tend not to succeed in any attempted
 project of stigmatisation/'ethicalisation' of hacking events is the
 difficulty of convincing people that events that transpire in virtual
 reality are in fact comparable and equivalent to criminal acts in the
 physical world.  We have seen for example the weaknesses of breaking and
 entering analogies.  They flounder upon the fact that hacking intrusions do
 not contain the same threats of transgression of personal physical space
 and therefore a direct and actual physical threat to an individual.  With
 the complete absence of such a threat, hacking activity will primarily
 remain viewed as an intellectual exercise and show of bravado rather than a
 criminal act, even if, on occasion, direct physical harm may be an indirect
 result of the technical interference caused by hacking.
 Thus the use of analogies is fraught with problems of equivalence.  Whilst
 they may be useful as a rough comparison between the real and virtual
 worlds, the innate but sometimes subtle, practical and ethical differences
 between the two worlds mean that analogies cannot be relied upon as a
 complete explanatory tool in seeking to understand the practical and
 ethical implications of computing:

They simply don't map well and can create models which are subtly and
 profoundly misleading.  For example, when we think of theft in the physical
 world, we are thinking of an act in which I might achieve possession of an
 object only by removing it from yours.  If I steal your horse, you can't
 ride.  With information, I can copy your software or data and leave the
 copy in your possession entirely unaltered (Barlow: e-mail interview).

 Information processed by computers is such that previous concepts of
 scarcity break down when correspondence is sought between the real and
 virtual worlds.  It is not just conceptions of scarcity that are affected,
 however,  the extent to which information correlates with the real world is
 questionable at the most fundamental levels:

Physical (and biological) analogies often are misleading as they appeal to
 an understanding from an area in which different laws hold.  Informatics
 has often mislead naive people by choosing terms such as 'intelligent' or
 'virus' though IT systems may not be compared to the human brain ... Many
 users (and even 'experts') think of a password as a 'key' despite the fact
 that you can easily 'guess' the password while it is difficult to do the
 equivalent for a key (Brunnstein: e-mail interview).

 Physical analogies are inevitably flawed in the respect  that they can only
 ever be used as an approximation of what occurs in 'cyberspace' in order to
 relate it to the everyday physical world.  Thus they attempt to evaluate
 and understand computing activities using a more natural and comfortable
 frame of reference.  Hence the language is often used by the CSI to
 describe computer attacks, and a security breach of the academic network
 with the acronym JANET, was referred to as the 'rape of JANET'.  Spafford
 admitted to having one of his systems hacked into at least three times, he
 argued that he: "didn't learn anything in particular that I didn't know
 before.  I felt quite violated by the whole thing, and did not view
 anything positive from it."(Spafford US interview [Emphasis mine]).  The CU
 stresses the differences between the virtual and real worlds and contends
 that the use of physical language in such a situation is not warranted.
 For example, despite such use of the language of physicality, it is
 difficult to conceive of a computer intrusion that could be as traumatising
 as the actual bodily violation of a rape.  A second, diametrically opposed,
 reason for questioning the validity of physical analogies would be that
 instead of overstating situations within computing, analogies used to
 describe a computer intrusion actually understate the harm caused by the
 intrusion due to the generic aspects of hacking identified earlier.
 In John Perry Barlow's "Crime and Puzzlement" recourse is made to the
 metaphors comparing hackers with cowboys from the nineteenth century USA.
 This specific comparison of hackers with cowboys illustrates some of the
 problems associated with the use of metaphors.  The basis of this metaphor
 rests upon the view of hackers as pioneers in the new field of computing,
 just as cowboys were portrayed as pioneers of the 'Wild West'.  Such a
 metaphor, in addition to the above discussion of the applicability of the
 concepts of trespass and theft to the world of computing, provides a useful
 example of both the suitability and limitations of analogies in discussions
 of hacking.  Commentators tend to 'customise' common metaphors used in the
 computer security debate, in order to derive from the metaphor the
 particular emphasis desired to further the point being argued:

Much of what we 'know' about cowboys is a mixture of myth, unsubstantiated
 glorification of 'independent he-men', Hollywood creations, and story
 elements that contain many racist and sexist perspectives.  I doubt that
 cracker/hackers are either like the mythic cowboy or the 'true' cowboy ...
 I think we should move away from the easy-but-inadequate analogy of the
 cowboy to other, more experienced-based discussions (Sherizen: e-mail
 interview).

 The tendency to use the 'easy-but-inadequate analogy' applies significantly
 to the orginator of the cowboy metaphor himself.  Thus, when I asked John
 Perry Barlow his views as to the accuracy of the metaphor, he replied:
 "Given that I was the first person to use that metaphor, you're probably
 asking the wrong guy.  Or maybe not, inasmuch as I'm now more inclined to
 view crackers as aboriginal natives rather than cowboys.  Certainly, they
 have an Indian view of property" (Barlow: e-mail interview).
 More negative responses to the comparison of hackers with cowboys came from
 the hackers themselves:

WHO is the electronic cowboy ... the electronic farmer, the electronic
 saloon keeper? ... I am not sold.  I offer no alternative, either.  I wait
 for hacking to evolve its own culture, its own stereotypes.  There was a
 T.V. show long ago, 'Have Gun Will Travel' about a gunslinger called
 'Palladin'.  The knightly metaphor ... but not one that was widely
 accepted.  Cowboys acted like cowboys, not knights, or Greeks, or cavemen.
 Hackers are hackers not cowboys (Marotta: e-mail interview).


6.7 THE PROJECT OF PROFESSIONALISATION

6.7.1 Creation of the computer security market and professional  ethos

 The creation of the 'them and us' situation forms part of the process
 whereby a professional status opposed to the hacking culture and ethic is
 established.  Examples have already been seen of the lack of cooperation
 that exists between the CSI and the CU in Chapter 5,  it gave various
 reasons for the CSI not being able to trust hackers sufficiently enough for
 cooperation to be feasible.  The antagonism that exists between the CSI and
 the CU contributes to a process of boundary formation, but there is also
 the widely-held belief that, along with legitimate reasons for
 differentiation between the two groups, there is also an element of
 manufactured difference.  Below are two examples, one from the commercial
 sector, and one from the CU, of people who believe parts of the CSI are
 involved in creating a market niche for themselves from which it then
 becomes necessary to exclude hackers:

Computer security industry' sounds like some high-priced consultants to me.
 Most of what they do could be summarised in a two-page leaflet - and its
 common sense anyway.  A consultant - particularly in the U.S. - spends
 3/4ths of his or her effort justifying the fee (Barrie Bates: e-mail
 interview).

These virus programs are about to make me sick!  In two years of heavily
 downloading from BBSs, I've yet to catch a virus from one.  Peter Norton
 should be drug to a field and shot!  McAffe too (Eric Hunt: e-mail
 interview).

 The veracity of opinions such as those above may be difficult to separate
 from their origin in the antagonism that exists between the CSI and the CU,
 but allegations that 'viral hype' has been used as a means of helping to
 create a computer security market come from security practitioners
 themselves:

It's very hard getting facts on this because the media hype is used as a
 trigger by people who are trying to sell anti-virus devices, programs,
 scanners, whatever.  This is put about very largely by companies who are
 interested in the market and they try to stimulate the market by putting
 the fear of God into people in order to sell their products, but selling
 them on the back of fear rather than constructive benefits, because most of
 the products in the industry are sold on constructive benefits.  You always
 sell the benefit first, this is selling it on the back of fear which is
 rather different, "you'd better use our products or else" (Taylor:
 Knutsford interview).

 The whole process of enforcing and furthering the proprietary attitude to
 information outlined in Chapter 3 is further strengthened by a new language
 of physicality resulting from the advent of computer viruses10.  Software
 is infected, and systems are spoken of in terms of being repeatedly
 'raped'.  Computer viruses are described in terms similar to those employed
 in discussions of the dangers of promiscuous sex.  Prophylactic safety
 measures are seen to be necessary to protect the moral majority from
 'unprotected contact' with the degeneracy of a minority group.  Ross argues
 that 'viral hysteria' has been deliberately used by the software industry
 to increase its market sales:

software vendors are now profiting from the new public distrust of program
 copies  ... the effects of the viruses have been to profitably clamp down
 on copyright delinquency, and to generate the need for entirely new
 industrial production of viral suppressors to contain the fallout.  In this
 respect it is hard to see how viruses could hardly, in the long run, have
 benefited industry producers more (Ross 1990: 80).

 In addition to the practical benefits the CSI has derived from the concerns
 associated with viruses, the threat they pose to systems' security has been
 used to reinforce ideological opposition to hackers and their
 anti-proprietary attitudes:

Virus-conscious fear and loathing have clearly fed into the paranoid climate
 of privatization that increasingly defines social identities in the new
 post-Fordist order.  The result -- a psycho-social closing of the ranks
 around fortified private spheres -- runs directly counter to the ethic that
 we might think of as residing at the architectural heart of information
 technology.  In its basic assembly structure, information technology is a
 technology is a technology of processing, copying, replication, and
 simulation, and therefore does not recognise the concept of private
 information property (Ross 1990: 80).

 The boundary formation exercise necessitates the exclusion of hackers from
 influence within computing, whilst, at the same time, developing a
 consistent ethical value system for 'legitimate' security professionals.
 An example of boundary formation in action is the advent of computer
 viruses and worms and the particular case of Robert Morris and the Internet
 Worm.  Cornell University published an official report into the Internet
 Worm incident, concluding that one of the causes of the act was Morris'
 lack of ethical awareness.  The report censures the ambivalent ethical
 atmosphere of Harvard, Morris' alma mater, where he failed to develop in a
 computing context a clear ethical sense of right and wrong.  Most
 significantly, the judgement made upon the Morris case was full of implicit
 assumptions that betrayed a boundary forming process in the way it stressed
 the need for professional ethics in opposition to those of hackers.
 Dougan and Gieryn (1988), sum up the boundary-forming aspects of responses
 to the Internet Worm in their analysis of the e-mail debate that occurred
 shortly after the incident.  The computer community is characterised as
 falling into two schools of thought with regard to their response to the
 event.  The first group is described as being organised around a principle
 of 'mechanic solidarity, the second, one of 'organic solidarity'.  The
 mechanic solidarity group's binding principle is the emphasis they place
 upon the ethical aspect of the Morris case, his actions are seen as
 unequivocally wrong and the lesson to be learnt in order to prevent future
 possible incidents is that a professional code of ethics needs to be
 promulgated.  These viewpoints have been illustrated in this study's
 depiction of the hawkish response to hacking.  The second group advocates a
 policy more consistent with the dovish element of the CSI and those hackers
 that argue their expertise could be more effectively utilised.  They
 criticise the first group for failing to prevent 'an accident waiting to
 happen'  and expecting that the teaching of computing ethics will solve
 what they perceive as an essentially technical problem.  The likelihood of
 eliminating the problem with the propagation of a suitable code of
 professional ethics seems to them remote:

I would like to remind everyone that the real bad guys do not share our
 ethics and are thus not bound by them.  We should make it as difficult as
 possible -- (while preserving an environment conducive to research)  for
 this to happen again.  The worm opened some eyes.  Let's not close them
 again by saying 'Gentlemen don't release worms' (Dougan and Gieryn 1988:
 12).

 The hacker Craig Neidorf known as 'Knight Lightning', in his  report on a
 CSI conference, underlines the theory that the debate over hacking centres
 upon a project of professionalisation, with the argument that what mostly
 distinguishes the two groups is the form, rather than content of the
 knowledge they seek to utilise:

Zenner and Denning11 alike discussed the nature of Phrack's12 articles.
 They found that the articles appearing in Phrack contained the same types
 of material found publicly in other computer and security magazines, but
 with one significant difference.  The tone of the articles.   An article
 named 'How to Hack Unix' in Phrack usually contained very similar
 information to an article you might see in Communications of the ACM only
 to be named 'Securing Unix Systems'. (Craig Neidorf: CuD 2.07).

 The implication is that hackers' security knowledge is not sought due to
 reasons other than its lack of technical value; instead the CSI fails to
 utilise such knowledge more fully because it interferes with their
 boundary-forming project that centres upon attempting to define the
 difference between a hacker and a 'computer professional':

Ironically, these hackers are perhaps driven by the same need to explore, to
 test technical limits that motivates computer professionals; they decompose
 problems, develop an understanding of them and then overcome them.  But
 apparently not all hackers recognise the difference between penetrating the
 technical secrets of their own computer and penetrating a network of
 computers that belong to others.  And therein lies a key distinction
 between a computer professional and someone who knows a lot about
 computers. (Edward Parrish 1989).

 Another interesting example of the similar traits that the CSI and CU share
 in common, is the case of Clifford Stoll's investigation of an intrusion
 into the Berkeley University computer laboratories, which he subsequently
 wrote up in the form of a best-selling book, The Cuckoo's Egg.  Thomas
 points out that:

Any computer undergrounder can identify with and appreciate Stoll's
 obsession and patience in attempting to trace the hacker through a maze of
 international gateways and computer systems.  But, Stoll apparently misses
 the obvious affinity he has with those he condemns.  He simply dismisses
 hackers as 'monsters' and displays virtually no recognition of the
 similarities between his own activity and those of the computer
 underground.  This is what makes Stoll's work so dangerous:  His work is an
 unreflective exercise in self-promotion, a tome that divides the sacred
 world of technocrats from the profane activities of those who would
 challenge it; Stoll stigmatises without understanding (Thomas 1990).

 What makes Stoll's behaviour even less understandable is that throughout
 the book he recounts how he himself engages in the same kind of activities
 that he criticises others for indulging in.  This fact that Stoll labels
 hackers as 'monsters' despite the fact he shares some of their qualities13
 is indicative of the boundary forming process the CSI have entered upon.
 The process also involves other groups that are involved in the de facto
 marginalisation of hackers whilst not actually being directly involved in
 computing, examples of such groups are the various government agencies and
 politicians involved in the drafting of legislation about hacking.
 Combined together, these groups have contributed towards a response to
 hacking that has been labelled a 'witch-hunt' mentality by some observers.

6.7.2 Witch-hunts and hackers

 Part of the cause of the witch-hunt mentality, that has allegedly been
 applied to hackers, is the increasing tendency within society towards the
 privatisation of consumption examined in the early chapters.  The pressures
 to commodify information can be seen as an extension of the decline of the
 public ethos in modern society which is accompanied by the search for
 scapegoats that will justify the retreat from communitarian spirit.   The
 hacker is the latest such scapegoat of modern times in a series including
 Communism, terrorism, child abductors and AIDS:

More and more of our neighbours live in armed compounds.  Alarms blare
 continuously.  Potentially happy people give their lives over to the
 corporate state as though the world were so dangerous outside its veil of
 collective immunity that they have no choice ... The perfect bogeyman for
 modern times is the Cyberpunk!  He is so smart he makes you feel even more
 stupid than you usually do.  He knows this complex country in which you're
 perpetually lost.  He understands the value of things you can't
 conceptualize long enough to cash in on.  He is the one-eyed man in the
 Country of the Blind  (Barlow 1990: 56).

 This is the root of peoples' fear of hackers and the reason why they are
 labelled as deviant within society despite the fact that, as we have seen
 above, hackers share some of the same characteristics as their CSI
 counterparts.  The simultaneous existence of shared characteristics and
 deviant status for hackers is a necessary result of the fact that:

The kinds of practices labelled deviant correspond to those values on which
 the community places its highest premium.  Materialist cultures are beset
 by theft (although that crime is meaningless in a utopian commune where all
 property is shared) ... The correspondence between kind of deviance and a
 community's salient values is no accident ... deviants and conformists both
 are shaped by the same cultural pressures -- and thus share some, if not
 all, common values -- though they may vary in their opportunities to pursue
 valued ends via legitimate means.  Deviance ... emerges exactly where it is
 most feared, in part because every community encourages some of its members
 to become Darth Vader, taking 'the force' over to the 'dark side' (Dougan
 and Gieryn 1990: 4).

 The vocalised antagonism between the CSI and CU and the exaggerated
 portrayals of the media examined in this chapter are part of the process
 whereby hackers are marginalised and defined as deviant.  In the quotation
 below Stoll is singled out to personify this process but the method he uses
 is held in common with all the other figures quoted in this chapter who
 contribute to the 'them and us' scenario by the strength of the views they
 express and the analogies they choose to express them with:

Witch hunts begin when the targets are labelled as 'other', as something
 quite different from normal people.  In Stoll's view, hackers, like
 witches, are creatures not quite like the rest of us, and his repetitious
 use of such pejorative terms as 'rats,' 'monsters,' 'vandals,' and
 'bastard' transforms the hacker into something less than human ... In a
 classic example of a degradation ritual, Stoll -- through assertion and
 hyperbole rather than reasoned argument -- has redefined the moral status
 of hackers into something menacing (Thomas 1990).

6.7.3 Closure - the evolution of attitudes

 The witch hunt process is a device to facilitate what Bijker and Law (1992)
 have analysed as closure.  The notion is usefully illustrated by examining
 the evolution of society's attitudes from the benign tolerance of the early
 MIT hackers to the present climate of anti-hacking legislation.  In
 addition to Levy's identification of three generations of hackers14,
 Landreth suggests the arrival of a fourth generation of hackers when he
 talks of a major change occurring in the CU around about the time the
 elitist hacking group he joined known as the "Inner Circle" was set up.  In
 addition to the effect of the increased dispersal of micro-computers, there
 was also the effect of the hacker movie Wargames.: "In a matter of months
 the number of self-proclaimed hackers tripled, then quadrupled.  You
 couldn't get through to any of the old bulletin boards any more - the
 telephone numbers were busy all night long.  Even worse, you could
 delicately work to gain entrance to a system, only to find dozens of
 novices blithely tromping around the files" (Landreth 1985 :18).  These
 'wannabe' hackers reflect the relative immaturity and absence of the
 original hacker ethic that characterises the latest manifestation of
 hacking.  Chris Goggans from the Legion of Doom concurs with this
 identification of a change in the basic nature of the CU environment.  In
 the early days:

People were friendly, computer users were very social.  Information was
 handed down freely, there was a true feeling of brotherhood in the
 underground.  As the years went on people became more and more anti-social.
  As it became more and more difficult to blue-box the social feeling of the
 underground began to vanish.  People began to hoard information and turn
 people in for revenge.  The underground today is not fun.  It is very power
 hungry, almost feral in its actions.  People are grouped off: you like me
 or you like him, you cannot like both ... The subculture I grew up with ,
 learned in, and contributed to, has decayed into something gross and
 twisted that I shamefully admit connection with.  Everything changes and
 everything dies, and I am certain that within ten years there will be no
 such thing as a computer underground.  I'm glad I saw it in its prime
 (Goggans: e-mail interview).

 Thus one reason for the changing nature of the computer underground is
 simply the fact that more would-be hackers arrived.  'Elite' hackers such
 as Goggans felt that this cheapened in some way the ethos and atmosphere of
 camaradarie that had previously existed within the CU.  Feelings of
 superiority which help to fuel the motivation of a hacker had become
 undermined by the advent of too many 'wanna-be' young hackers.  Sheer
 numbers alone would mean the demise of the previous emphasis hackers placed
 upon sharing knowledge and the importance of educating young hackers.  The
 idiosyncratic actions of the first generation hackers, within the isolated
 academic context of MIT, were often praised for their inventiveness.
 Similar actions in the wider modern computing community tend to be
 automatically more disruptive and liable to censure.
 The reasons for this change in attitude are inextricably linked with the
 evolution of computing as a technology.  Herschberg argues that computer
 security can be compared to the experiments of the Wright brothers, yet
 apart from such peripheral 'dovish' sentiments, the climate within the CSI
 and society as a whole is increasingly unsympathetic to the claims by
 hackers that they represent innocent intellectual explorers: closure in
 computer security has occurred.  Leichter's perception of the evolution of
 hacking is at odds with that of Herschberg.  He too uses an airplane
 analogy but prefers to emphasise that:

When the first 'airplane hackers' began working on their devices, they were
 free to do essentially as they pleased.  If they crashed and killed
 themselves well, that was too bad.  If their planes worked - so much the
 better.  After it became possible to build working airplanes , there
 followed a period in which anyone could build one and fly where he liked.
 But in the long run that became untenable ... If you want to fly today, you
 must get a license.  You must work within a whole set of regulations (Jerry
 Leichter: CuD 4.18).

 Over time, technologies develop, and as a result, people's interactions
 with that technology, even if they remain unchanged, will be viewed
 differently as society adapts to the changing technology.  An example of
 this is the changing role of system crashes.  In the earliest days of
 computing, the computers functioned by means of large glass valves, which
 after relatively short periods of use were liable to over-heat, thus
 causing a system crash.  Even if hackers were responsible for some of the
 system crashes that occurred, the fact that they were equally liable to be
 caused by other non-hacker means, led to a climate whereby hacker-induced
 crashes were accepted as a minor inconvenience even when they were
 extremely disruptive by today's standards.  This is an example, therefore,
 of the importance of taking into account the societal context of an act
 involving technology before an evaluation of its ethical content is made.

6.8 CONCLUSION

 This chapter has traced the origin of the ethical debate between the CSI
 and the CU, showing how the novel nature of some of the situations thrown
 up by computing has resulted in a process of negotiation.  This process
 takes the form of markedly different ethical responses to the novel
 situations being made and competing with each other.  The contrasting
 interests and perspectives of the two groups is highlighted by the fact
 that whilst  hackers see their activity as manifesting ethical concern over
 potential governmental and commercial abuses of privacy, the CSI prefers to
 see the activity as unethical or as evidence of a general decline in social
 values.
 There are two important elements of doubt regarding the view of the CSI.
 Firstly, the argument that hacking is intrinsically unethical is weakened
 by the fact that, as Levy documents, the same acts of hacking that are now
 criticised as immoral, were benignly tolerated in the days of the early MIT
 hackers.  Bloombecker even goes so far as to claim that what would nowadays
 be labelled a computer criminal, helped to make computing what it  is.
 Cohen also asserts, that unofficially, hackers are often used commercially
 to check the security of systems.  Secondly, the chapter has shown, that an
 increasing aspect of computing is the way in which it produces novel
 situations where there seem to be no clear-cut boundaries between right and
 wrong.  This is most noticeable in the situations produced by technology
 that are most divorced from everyday experience, typified by the notion of
 cyberspace.  Ethical uncertainty concerning hacking is also exacerbated by
 the fact that the activity is often motivated by a series of complex
 factors.  The fact that there is a keen debate, both within the CSI, and
 between the CSI and the CU, implies that any purported immorality of
 hacking is due to the social shaping of a perception that has evolved from
 the MIT  days of benign tolerance to the present atmosphere of
 criminalisation.
 An important part of this process of social shaping is the way in which
 physical analogies are used in the formation of computer ethics.  They are
 being increasingly used in professional discussions of the issues as part
 of the process of group delineation.  Where previously there were only
 blurred or indefinite computer ethics, physical analogies are now used to
 establish clearer computing mores.   The need to use physical analogies in
 the first place arises because hacking takes place in  the qualitatively
 new realm of human experience: cyberspace.  The fact that the real world
 and cyberspace are such different realms has led to a need to explain and
 make ethical judgements about hacking from a conventional frame of
 reference, that is, using analogies based upon the physical world.
  The constant use of physical analogies and metaphors in discussing the
 legal and ethical issues of hacking is thus an attempt to redefine, in a
 practical manner, the concept of informational property rights, as they are
 to be applied in the computer age.  The use of analogies is much more
 common within the CSI than it is from hackers themselves.  This is because
 the CSI have a general need to make comparisons between cyberspace and the
 real world in order to legitimate their role and to demonise the CU.
 Hackers do not have this need; their behaviour is based upon accepting
 computing as a realm of intellectual and social experimentation, and they
 find it attractive because of the very fact that it is different from the
 real world.
 In summary, there are perennial claims from each successive generation that
 the youth of the age are largely unethical, and that they are harbingers of
 a break-down in the general moral order.   Such claims are perhaps an
 inevitable part of the human condition, and its inter-generational
 relations.  This study, however,  is more concerned with the specific
 aspects of computing that give rise to  qualitatively new circumstances
 facing computer users, the ethics of which are indeterminate.  These
 situations encourage behaviour, which, to be recognised as unethical,
 assumes that an adequate and convincing comparison can be made with
 non-computing situations.  It is the difficulty of attempting to
 conceptualise the ethics of computer-induced scenarios that leads to
 attempts to translate them into a more easily understood and common-place
 experience.
 The chapter shows, however, that there is doubts as to whether 'real-world'
 ethics can be transposed in such a literal manner.  This is illustrated by
 the various examples given of the CSI's alleged double standards.  These
 examples imply that the vagueness of computing ethics is such that any
 professional code of ethics that is produced is likely to be more the
 result of one group enforcing its value system on another group, rather
 than one group having any inherently superior moral advantage in the
 ethical debate.
 The process whereby one group's value system can be imposed upon another
 has been analysed in a frame of reference that compares the increasing
 marginalisation of hackers from mainstream computer usage to the practice
 of witch-hunts.  One analysis of the gradual stigmatisation of hackers is
 that they have been part of a degradation ritual whereby a more dominant
 social group has progressively alienated them from 'normal' society in
 order to promote its professional interest.  The role of the media in this
 process has been shown by the way it projects hackers as stigmatised
 'others', thus aiding the boundary forming professionalisation process of
 the CSI.
 Particular examples of the process of group differentiation and
 professionalisation have been given, relating to the advent of viruses and
 the specific case of the Internet Worm.  The likelihood of eliminating
 threats to computer security with the propagation of a suitable code of
 professional ethics seems remote considering the extent of the CU's ethical
 disagreement with the CSI and the thrill obtained from the very fact that
 the CU is 'underground'.  Despite this, once the process of
 professionalisation has been initiated, the temptation is to proceed to
 codify the nascent but dominant group's response to computing's ethical
 dilemmas, by means of legislation.
 The subsequent closure of computing technology has occurred to such an
 extent that the hippy-like ethos of the CU looks increasingly anachronistic
 in the 1980's and 90's.  In so far as hackers have represented a force of
 anti-capitalistic information-sharing, their stance seems to have absorbed
 within the state's sponsorship of the development of computing technology.
 The second generation hard-ware hackers such as Steve Wozniak, have seen
 their 'wholesome and green' product (hence the name 'Apple') brought to the
 masses as indeed they wished, but significantly as a commodified product.
 This is perhaps a reflection of the market's ability to co-opt and absorb
 radical change.  It threatens, in the case of hackers, to undermine their
 status as a group embodying alternative values.  The new generation of
 'wanna-be' hackers, is significant because it represents more than simply
 adolescent boys intrigued by the intellectual challenge and feelings of
 power of illicit computing.  In addition, they also represent the
 increasing tendency of information to be viewed as a tradeable commodity in
 the form of 'Amiga kid'-type groups.  Their illicit blackmarket activities
 and their seemingly amoral views regarding the ethical implications of
 accessing and manipulating other peoples' information represents the
 extreme end of a spectrum which also includes the activity of 'benign'
 hackers.  It is a spectrum whose various points reflect some of the ethical
 issues that society still has to satisfactorily address regarding
 information and the implications of its changing properties.
 An example of the unsettled nature of society's response to  information is
 the doubt that still remains regarding the effects of its policy of closure
 towards hackers.  The question still arises from the above analysis of
 whether the evolution of attitudes towards the CU is in response to a
 change in its nature towards a more crime-orientated environment, or
 whether the increased tendency to perceive and portray hacking as a
 criminal and unethical activity has taken on the quality of a
 self-fulfilling prophecy, driving would-be 'pleasure hackers' into the arms
 of the criminal underground.  The implications of this latter scenario are
 examined in the next chapter.

 encountered in the fieldwork) have started their own computer firms;
 Professor Herschberg has contacts with and produces interaction between
 hackers and the security industry by means of his consultancy work, and the
 authorised and unauthorised (in the case of accepting a documented hack in
 lieu of a dissertation) use of students to test systems.

 horse hidden within a diskette to extort money from recipients whose
 systems had subsequently become infected.  The trial did not come to court,
 however, because his defence argued that he was mentally unfit to stand
 trial.  They described how he had taken to putting  hair curlers in his
 beard and wearing a cardboard box on his head in an apparent attempt to
