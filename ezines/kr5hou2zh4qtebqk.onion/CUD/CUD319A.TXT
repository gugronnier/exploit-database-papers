A few quick notes:
 
A minor malfunction crashed the new FREE SPEECH BBS for a few days. It
is back up with a new number:
(618) 943-2102
 
FREE SPEECH is intended to provide a forum similar to the former
FACE-TO-FACE BBS for discussion of legal, ethical, technical, and
other issues of interest to computer hobbyists.

The CUD issues on CompuServe have been shuffled around a bit.  Recent
issues can be found in DL0 of the IBMBBS SIG and in DL1 of LAWSIG.
Back issues can be found in DL4 of the IBMBBS SIG.  LAWSIG will one
day have all the back issues as well, when I or some other brave soul
takes the time to upload them.  Cooperation between forums, to the
extent of copying the files from IBMBBS to LAWSIG, is apparently not
possible.
