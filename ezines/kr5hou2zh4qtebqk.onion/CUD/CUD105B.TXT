Summary: overzealous law enforcement?

Here in New York, and other places as well, grand juries are known for
being tools of prosecutors, in that the prosecutor is able to manipulate
the evidence presented before them as much as he or she likes in order to
convince the grand jury to indict or not indict as the prosecutor desires.
Every now and then some newspaper here calls for the abolishment of the
grand jury system entirely because it is merely an extension of the
prosecutor's will.  This isn't true everywhere -- things vary.  But in most
cases, a grand jury is not a check against an overzealous prosecutor.

2600 magazine a few years ago reprinted the courtroom transcripts for a
search warrant issued for a particular bulletin board system at a
particular phone number.  The local police testified that they hadn't
actually been able to verify that a BBS was at this number, because the
number was always busy.  They did not present any evidence that the BBS had
been involved in any illegal activity, except that its phone number had been
found on another BBS.  The judge signed the warrant anyway.

The legal system can be abused for anyone, including mafioso.  We should be
especially vigilant of possible abuse when it comes to these
computer-related cases, because not only is the legal system is still
sorting out what is a crime, but prosecutors, police and judges are still
learning what computers are, and the media exaggeration and
sensationalization of any computer-related case tends to make it difficult
for remote observers (like here in Telecom) to make informed opinions.

"Pain Hertz" had a question we couldn't answer. Perhaps somebody
else can:
-------------


I recall seeing a text file about a BBS in Ca. whos sysop was the defendent
in a lawsuit involving LD access codes.  It seems that an 'automessage' was
posted with the codes and a PacBell employee logged on finding them.  This
was several years ago and stirred a debate over the liability of a BBS
sysop.  I would like to know how this was resolved.  I will try to find the
original text file.  If I recall correctly, this BBS was located in San
Diego.
