Subject: File 1--Response to "Ghost in the Modem" (CuD 6.50)

In CuD 6.50 I read an article entitled "Ghost in the Modem (Loka Alert
1:6 Wash.  Post)".  In this article, authors Richard Sclove and
Jeffrey Scheuer deliver several warnings about the possible effects of
the developement of the Information Superhighway and conclude by
suggesting three restrictions that, they assert, should be placed on
information service developement.

  While I find myself in more or less complete disagreement with the
authors, I am not going to argue about the thesis of their article
today.  Instead, I would like to draw attention to a statement made
earlier in the article which I believe indicates an underlying false
assumption.

  The statement is: "And the risk of inequity in contriving and
distributing electronic services [...] is clear."

  This statement seems to assume that access to information technology
should be equally distributed among individuals.  The reason that I
find this assumption disturbing enough to write about is because I
often see variations on such a theme echoed in Computer underground
Digest, but I rarely if ever see a contradictory opinion stated.

     I would like to take this opportunity to state that I
     believe egalitarianism, in regard to information technology
     as elsewhere, is an irrational, immoral, and dangerous
     ideal.

  As a denizen of cyberspace and a long-time reader of CuD, I would
like others to know that I will not assist anyone in his or her
attempt to enact policies which, I believe, would be vastly
destructive to the cyber-society, and the real society which I
inhabit.
  I am sure that many of my fellow Net citizens have similar ideals
and ideologies, but I would not know it from reading CuD!

commentary and criticism is welcome

Dana C. Ellingen <ellingen@netcom.com> is preparing a special issue of
the Ferris E-Mail Analyzer on security in electronic mail, and would
like to get your input.  If any of you would like to respond to him,
send him email or get in touch with him as follows:

Following are his questions.

 Mark



Note that all answers will be "not for attribution," and will be
melded into the overall issue.

Vendors, I would like the names of several happy users of your
product, even if they have just chosen it and it is not yet installed.
I am interested in why they chose to make this move now rather than
later, as well as how happy they may be with your product.

Questions for Email Security users, for Ferris E-Mail Analyzer:

A - What form of security does your firm use for electronic mail and
messaging?

B - Given the state of turmoil in the industry, why did you choose to be
an "early adopter," and to put security into your forms and
messaging applications?  Why now?

C - What problems have you had, having added security?

D - What compromises have you had to make to add security?

E - Product support:  Do you currently use (or are you considering) a
commercial product for secure EM?  Which one?  Why?
Are you happy with the support you are getting?

F - Interoperability:  Do you currently or do you want to exchange
secure EM with people outside of your organization?  How do you
deal with the interoperability problem?

G - International:  Do you have overseas offices, or do you exchange
secure EM with persons outside of the US?  Are you concerned about
having to cut back on your security to do this?

H - Certificates:  Do you issue certificates to your users?

I - Certificates:  If someone else issues certificates, how do
establish trust with that organization?

J - Certificates:  How do you verify the authenticity of a
digital signature on a document that you receive?

K - Policy:  Does your firm have a written policy on electronic
mail?  Can your firm read its employees' EM?

L - Escrowed keys:  Do you keep copies of the private keys of the
individuals in your firm?  Do you think that you should, or that
you have the right to do so?

M - Integration:  How important is it that you have a product that is
fully integrated with your existing mail system?

N - What did I leave out?  What else do you want to discuss?

HACKERS ON PLANET EARTH: The First U.S. Hacker Congress

Yes, it's finally happening. A hacker party unlike anything ever seen
before in this country. Come help us celebrate ten years of existence
and meet some really interesting and unusual people in the process.
We've rented out the entire top floor of a midtown New York hotel,
consisting of several gigantic ballrooms. The conference will run
around the clock all weekend long.

SPEAKERS AND SEMINARS: Will there be famous people and celebrity
hackers? Of course, but the real stars of this convention will be
the hundreds of hackers and technologically inclined people journeying
from around the globe to share information and get new ideas.
That is the real reason to show up. Seminars include:
social engineering, cellular phone cloning, cable TV security,
stealth technology and surveillance, lockpicking, boxing of all sorts,
legal issues, credit cards, encryption, the history of 2600,
password sniffing, viruses, scanner tricks, and many more in the
planning stages. Meet people from the Chaos Computer Club, Hack-Tic,
Phrack, and all sorts of other k-rad groups.

THE NETWORK: Bring a computer with you and you can tie into the huge
Ethernet we'll be running around the clock. Show off your system and
explore someone else's (with their permission, of course). We will
have a reliable link to the Internet in addition. Finally, everyone
attending will get an account on our hope.net machine. We encourage
you to try and hack root. We will be giving away some valuable prizes
to the successful penetrators, including the keys to a 1994 Corvette.
(We have no idea where the car is, but the keys are a real
conversation piece.) Remember, this is only what is currently planned.
Every week, something new is being added so don't be surprised to find
even more hacker toys on display. We will have guarded storage areas
if you don't want to leave your equipment unattended.

VIDEOS: We will have a brand new film on hackers called
"Unauthorized Access", a documentary that tells the story from
our side and captures the hacker world from Hamburg to Los Angeles
and virtually everywhere in between. In addition, we'll have
numerous foreign and domestic hacker bits, documentaries,
news stories, amateur videos, and security propaganda. There
has been a lot of footage captured over the years - this will
be a great opportunity to see it all. We will also have one
hell of an audio collection, including prank calls that put
The Jerky Boys to shame, voice mail hacks, and even confessions
by federal informants! It's not too late to contribute material!

WHERE/WHEN: It all happens Saturday, August 13th and Sunday,
August 14th at the Hotel Pennsylvania in New York City
(Seventh Avenue, between 32nd and 33rd Streets, right across
the street from Penn Station). If you intend to be part of
the network, you can start setting up Friday night.
The conference officially begins at noon on Saturday and will
run well into Sunday night.

ACCOMMODATIONS: New York City has numerous cheap places to stay.
Check the update sites below for more details as they come in.
If you decide to stay in the hotel, there is a special discounted
rate if you mention the HOPE Conference. $99 is their base rate
(four can fit in one of these rooms, especially if sleeping bags
are involved), significantly larger rooms are only about $10 more.
Mini-suites are great for between six and ten people - total cost
for HOPE people is $160. If you work with others, you can easily
get a room in the hotel for between $16 and $50.
The Hotel Pennsylvania can be reached at (212) PEnnsylvania 6-5000
(neat, huh?). Rooms must be registered by 7/23/94 to get the
special rate.

TRAVEL: There are many cheap ways to get to New York City in August
but you may want to start looking now, especially if you're coming
from overseas. Travel agencies will help you for free. Also look in
various magazines like Time Out, the Village Voice, local alternative
weeklies, and travel sections of newspapers. Buses, trains, and
carpools are great alternatives to domestic flights. Keep in touch
with the update sites for more information as it comes in.

WANTED: Uncommon people, good music (CD's or cassettes), creative
technology. To leave us information or to volunteer to help out,
call us at (516) 751-2600 or send us email on the Internet at:

Subject: File 4--Video Game Rating Act of 1994

What I don't like about this approach is that Congress is acting as the
labeling agent.  This violates the industry commission precedent set with
movies, comic books, and music.

The big video companies (Sega/Nintendo/etc) have counter-offered to
create their own commission that would charge $500 per title to rate.

Here is a summary of the actual bill that Representative Lantos wants.
The rating system will be voluntary after all (at least until 1996),
so I retract the imminent-death-of-all-shareware prediction.

Student Pugwash USA, a national, educational, non-
profit organization, is dedicated to building a
commitment among young people to solve critical
global problems through the responsible use of
science and technology.  Student Pugwash USA
draws its name from Pugwash, Nova Scotia, where in
1957 several of the world's leading scientists
gathered at the behest of Albert Einstein and
Bertrand Russell to address pressing issues at the
forefront of technology and global security.
Following this tradition, Student Pugwash USA
began coordinating educational programs for
graduate and undergraduate students in 1979,
beginning with an International Conference on
technology and ethical responsibility held at the
University of California at San Diego.

Student Pugwash USA programs also include a
student-initiated Chapter Program, extending to
over 175 university, college and high school
campuses nation-wide, and a "New Careers"
Program, linking  students to career opportunities
and mentors in the areas of technology and social
change.  Additionally, Student Pugwash USA
International Conferences have led to the formation
of Student/Young Pugwash organizations in 18
countries around the world.
