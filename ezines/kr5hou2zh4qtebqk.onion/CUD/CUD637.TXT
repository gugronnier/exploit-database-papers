((MODERATORS' NOTE: We join with others to whom John Perry Barlow has
given so much in extending our deepest sympathy to him following the
tragic and sudden passing of Cynthia Horner. His public
accomplishments and gifts to others will not assuage his own grief,
but the extent to which he and his life have touched many of us in
cyberspace means that he has the support and condolences us all. His
eulogy to Cynthia stands as a permanent cybermarker representing his
love for her)).

From--John Perry Barlow <barlow@EFF.ORG>

I just cleaned up some of the typos and awkwardnesses in Cynthia's eulogy
and am sending it to you.

I know that news of her death is circulating the Net and I'm getting an
incredible outpouring of shock and sympathy. For any good it might do, I
hope you will post this to some of the places where news of her death has
appeared. I mean it to stand as her gravestone in the virtual world.


Cynthia Horner's Eulogy
read by John Perry Barlow at her funeral April 22, 1994 in Nanaimo,
Vancouver Island, BC..

I don't know most of you, and I envy the many among you who were graced
with Cynthia all her life. I only knew her a little while.  We spent the
last glorious year of her life together. It was the best year of my life
and, I firmly believe, it was the best year of her life too.

Last Sunday morning, during the last hour we spent together, we were
playing with a cat with strangely green eyes.

She looked at me with her own beautiful green eyes and said, "You know,
James Joyce said that green eyes were a sign of the supernatural." The way
she said it seemed pointed and meaningful. And hope makes me want to
believe it all the more meaningful now.

I don't know that I believe in the supernatural, but I do believe in
miracles, and our time together was filled with the events of magical
unlikelihood. I also believe that sometimes angels live among us, hidden
within our fellow human beings. I'm convinced that such an angel dwelled in
Cynthia. I felt this presence often in Cynthia's lightness of being, in her
decency, her tolerance, her incredible love. I never heard Cynthia speak
ill of anyone nor did I ever hear anyone speak ill of her. She gave joy and
solace to all who met her.

I feel her angel still, dancing around the spiritual periphery, just beyond
the sight of my eyes, narrowed as they are with the glare of ordinary
light. Her graceful goodness continues to surround me, if less focused and
tangible than before.

With a care that was appropriately reverential, Cynthia and I built a love
which was an inspiration to all who came into contact with it. We felt,
quite consciously, that it was our gift to the world. We wanted to show the
hesitant the miracle that comes when two people give their hearts
unconditionally, honestly, fearlessly, and without reservation or
judgement. We wanted to make our union into a message of hope, and I
believe we did, even though we knew that hearts opened so freely can be
shattered if something should go wrong. As my heart is shattered now.

So among the waves of tragedy which have crashed on me with her death is a
terror that our message of hope has been changed into a dreadful warning.
But I am here to tell you that had I known at the beginning that I would be
here today doing this terrible thing, I would still have loved her as
unhesitatingly, because true love is worth any price one is asked to pay.

The other message we wished to convey was one of faith in the essential
goodness and purpose of life. I have always felt that no matter how
inscrutable its ways and means, the universe is working perfectly and
working according to a greater plan than we can know.

In the last few days, I have had to battle with the fear that everything is
actually just random, that the universe is a howling void of meaningless
chaos, indifferent to everything that I value. All hope has at times seemed
unjustified to me.

But groundless hope, like unconditional love, is the only kind worth having.

It's true name is faith. As it is a shallow faith which goes untested, so
it is that if we can keep our faith through this terrible test, we will
emerge with a conviction of incredible and enduring strength. And this
faith will become Cynthia's greatest gift to us. If we can build with our
lives a monument to her light and her love, she will not have died in vain,
and her death will become as much a miracle as was her life.

______________________________)


TO THE HONORABLE MARILYN PATEL, FEDERAL DISTRICT COURT JUDGE:

1.   Claimants Robert and Carleen Thomas had their premises
searched on January 10 based on a search warrant allegedly signed
by Magistrate Brazil on January 6, 1994.  At this time Claimants
entire computer bulletin board system (BBS) was seized.  The
warrant was issued without the required showings under both the
Electronic Communication Privacy Act and the First Amendment
Privacy Protection Act:
2.   This warrant was applied for by Postal Inspector Dirmeyer from
Tennessee who, among other things, allege that he had offered to
send child pornography through the mails to one of the claimants--
though his affidavit is equivocal on the actual nature and time of
what communications transpired between himself and the claimant.
On the day the search warrant was issued, the Postal Inspector sent
claimant a package of child pornography.  Within minutes of its
receipt, and while claimants were wondering what to do with the
unsolicited material (for which they had absolutely no use), the
Postal Inspector knocked on their door with a warrant to take their
computer BBS.
3.   Because the Postal Inspector  had neglected to obtain a
warrant to get his government supplied child pornography back, he
was faced with the choice of a trip back to San Francisco or
getting permission from the claimant to take the child pornography.
Claimant having no use for the material agreed that the Postal
Inspector could take it.  Postal Inspector Dirmeyer described the
material in his own block handwriting as "namely priority mail
package from Lance White addressed to Robert Thomas sent without
his knowledge."  ["Lance White" was the name Postal Inspector
Dirmeyer used to access the claimants BBS.]
4.   In conversation with a citizen of good reputation the Saturday
following the search, Postal Inspector Dirmeyer claimed that
sending unsolicited child pornography to people was standard
investigative procedure and that he had done this in hundreds of
investigations.
5.   Mr. Dirmeyer came here from Tennessee making the claim that
the BBS operated by claimants had materials on it which were
obscene by Tennessee standards.  It is not clear weather or not
these were shown to Magistrate Brazil, or if Magistrate Brazil has
knowledge of either local or Tennessee standards for obscenity.
The search warrant left at the premises had the case number 3-94-
3005 WDB (later changed for unknown reasons to 94-3-30005 WDB).
6.   I personally went to the Federal District Court in San Jose to
obtain a docket sheet (since I had reasons to doubt Judge Brazil
had actually signed the search warrant) and discovered there was no
such file.  I went to San Francisco and was told (1) there was a
file, (2) it was not sealed, (3) but I couldn't see it because the
U.S. Attorney had it and I should check back in a few days.  I
checked back three days later and was told that there still was no
file available.  I called Judge Brazil's office and was told by his
secretary that she could find no evidence that this application had
been before Judge Brazil.  I could hear someone approach Judge
Brazil's secretary and she ask me to 'hold.'  I did, and when she
came back, she told me that there was a file but it was "sealed."
7.   The affidavit itself was never sealed by Judicial order,
though the allegedly obscene attachments were.  In spite of
persistent efforts, the affidavit was kept from me until several
days after it was "unsealed" on January 27, the day after an
indictment issued in Tennessee and three days before this court
would coast to e the general duty Court.
8.   I complained of my clients due process rights being violated
and filed my motion in this court which should have been heard on
February 28, 1994 at 2:30 pm.  I was informed the morning of the
28th that the U.S. Attorney had contacted your clerk (Ms Morriyama)
and had taken me off calendar.  My motion was then rerouted to
Judge Caulfield.  I was also told that the U.S. Attorney had taken
me off calendar by Magistrate Brennan's clerk who was calling to
re-route my motion.  I feel that my clients, myself, and this court
have been the victims of fraud, and deception by the U.S.
Attorney's office, Magistrate Brazil and his staff, and possibly Ms
Morriyama, this court's clerk.
9.   I am requesting that this court relate this motion pursuant to
Rule 205-2 to the Nation Association of Radiation Survivors vs.
Harry N. Walters, Case No.  C-83-1861 MPH or any other similar case
the court is aware of wherein the court dealt with the issue of
fraud, manipulation of evidence and deception on the court.

POINTS AND AUTHORITIES

"Relatedness" is governed by FRPC Section 205-2 which states:

   RULE 205-2.  NOTICE OF RELATED CASE

(a) Duties  of Counsel.   Whenever counsel  has
reason to believe that an action or proceeding on file
or about to be filed is related to another action or
proceeding on file with the court (whether or not
dismissed  or  otherwise  terminated),  counsel  shall
promptly file and serve on all known parties to each
related action  or proceeding  a  Notice  of Related
Case, stating the title,  number and filing date of
each action or proceeding believed to be related,
together with a brief statement of their relationship
and the reasons why assignment to a single judge is
or is not likely to effect a saving of judicial effort
and other economies.  The clerk will promptly notify
the court of such filing.

(b) Definition of Related Action.  An action or
proceeding is related to another when both actions
or proceedings:                        '
                                . '

    (i) involve the same parties and are based on the
        same or similar claims;  or

   (ii) involve  the  same  property,  transaction  or
        event;  or

  (iii) involve substantially the same facts and the
        same questions of law.

(c) Procedure After Filing.  Within ten days after
    service of a Notice of Related Case, any party
    may file a counterstatement supporting or opposing
    the Notice.  The court will then determine whether
    reassignment should be made.



Conclusion:
     In conclusion, Applicants respectfully request that this case
be determined to be related to th Atomic Survivor's case or any
other cases on the basis of fraud, manipulation of evidence, and
deception on the court.

Respectfully Submitted by

Richard D. Williams
Attorney for Claimants

Subject: File 3--David LaMacchia Defense Fund established

The David LaMacchia Defense Fund was organized to ensure that David
LaMacchia gets a fair trial.  LaMacchia has been indicted by the
federal government for conspiracy to commit wire fraud.  "This is the
first time in Massachusetts that the wire fraud statute has been used
in a computer bulletin board case," said Stephen Heyman, deputy chief
in the US attorney's office.  That makes the case interesting,
law-making, and very expensive.  An unfortunate side-effect of our
common law system, where laws are made by decisions in particular
cases, is that an individual involved in a constitutional test case is
faced with the certainty of staggering legal bills as well as the
possibility of imprisonment and fines.

Contributions to the Fund will be used to defray a portion of
LaMacchia's legal expenses.  The Fund spends nothing on advertising,
salaries, promotions, etc.; 100% of contributions are used for legal
defense.

The Fund takes no position on the merits of either side's case.

You can make a pledge to the Fund by sending email to

Subject: File 4--What to do with Old Computers

I thought this might be of more general interest.

We have received a number of Email responses to our posting on how to
usefully dispose of our "obsolete" Apple IIE.  I think it would be
useful to summarize these and post the note to other newsgroups as I
have seen nothing similar elsewhere but the need must exist.

First though the argument about whether an "obsolete" computer is
still of interest.  Clearly, the answer is yes since many indicated
that they saw a use for it--however, no potential users themselves
actually posted to us asking for the machine.  Also how will users of
"orphan" systems handle the problem of parts, software, data transfer
and so on.  Will the use of these machines in the Third World or by
community groups in the long run be more trouble than they are
worth--their use for education is another matter since the principles
of computing should remain the same even though the details of
specific systems differ--but even there there may be disagreement.

The initial question was how to disponse of a working Apple IIE.  The
specific answers we received (in addition to a number of general
responses to "give it to local schools or community groups") were as
follows:

1.  Jeff Smith (jasmith@well.st.ca.us)
His group is currently sending educational materials to South East Asia
including Vietnam, Cambodia and the Philippines.  They are interested in
sending used computers (serviceable with all parts) as  new priority.

He mentioned a Silicon Valley Group which is rehabing computers to give to
local schools and non-profits.

Grants will be awarded after a competitive merit review process and will be
used to fund projects to connect institutions to existing networks and
systems, enhance communications networks and systems that are currently
operational, establish new network capabilities, permit users to
interconnect among different networks and systems, and bring more users
on-line.  Equally important, they will help leverage the resources and
creativity of the private sector to devise new applications and uses of the
NII.  The success of these pilot projects will create an ongoing process
that will generate more innovative approaches each year."

Subject: File 6--"Porn Library" Seized at British University (Reprint)

Here is an article that appeared in The (London) Times today
concerning 'computer porn'. Notice that the man involved does not
appear to have been _charged_ (yet) with any crime. English law is,
like that of many other countries, very flakey when it comes to this
sort of thing.

Computer porn 'library' seized at university

By Richard Ford
Home Correspondent

A BRITISH university is at the centre of an international enquiry
into an alleged worldwide computer pornography network after police
seized equipment containing large amounts of obscene.

    Police officers swooped on the metallurgy department at Birmingham
University after information from the United States federal
authorities investigating computer pornography.

    A male research associate, 25, who works in the department has
been questioned by officers from West Midlands police and Scotland
Yard about the haul of material. His home was also raided by officers.

    Officers seized a computer with "thousands of files" containing
child and adult sex pictures from the university. Pornographic films,
magazines and computer material were also allegedly found at the man's
address.

    Police believe the man, who lives in the Moseley area of
Birmingham, was acting as a "librarian" for the explicit images which
allegedly include children as young as two years. They do not believe
he received any financial gain from his activities.

    Pictures taken from hardcore pornographic magazines were
transferred on to computer disk. Up to 20 million subscribers to the
Internet computer system would have had access to the material if they
had known the secret code number.

    Investigators in Kentucky hacked into the system and traced the
pornographic material to Birmingham University.

    Chief Inspector Keith Bassett of West Midlands Police said: "We
are not aware of any money changing hands. It seems he was acting as a
librarian purely for personal gratification. The material we have
viewed so far is pretty dreadful pornography. There is no way of
knowing how many people he had been serving. The possibilities are
endless.

    "Computer devices were seized containing substantial pornographic
material, including depicting children in obscene acts," he said.

    A spokesman for the university said the research associate's
contract had expired at the end of March and would not be renewed.

    He said : "Clearly this is an appalling incident and we will be
looking to see if there is anything we can do to ensure it never
happens again. Everyone involved with the university is very
distressed by this."

ON-LINE STALKER SUSPECT CHARGED WITH FRAUD
>From the Orange County Register,
Saturday, April 16, 1994

A Fresno man suspected of using nationwide computer networks to stalk
and harass people was charged Friday with using false credit-card
numbers in a scheme to terrorize women in several states.

Police hope the arrest of Mark Johnson, 39, will end a months-long
reign of threats and harassment by an on-line stalker known as "Vito"
to thousands of computer users.

Johnson is charged with 44 counts of credit-card fraud, grand theft
and distributing pornography to a minor, papers filed Friday in Fresno
Municipal Court show.

                The Electronic Frontiers Japan mailing list
                        Background and guidelines
                              Mar. 28, 1994

Electronic communication has become an integral part of the lives of
people in all corners of the globe.  Japan, no exception, is slowly but
surely expanding into the electronic frontier, grappling with a myriad
of issues such as who will establish and maintain new communications
systems, who will control these systems, the level of government
regulation to apply, and the rights of individuals as we develop a
ubiquitous information infrastructure.

To date, the answers to many of these questions have been supplied, not
necessarily in the public's best interests, by government agencies and
large telecommunications corporations.  There has been both a lack of
dialogue among those concerned about connectivity issues in Japan as
well as a lack of information about available electronic communication
services, the political landscape, important public policy decisions,
and the law.

The Electronic Frontiers Japan mailing list has been formed to provide a
public forum for such dialogue.  The list's name intentionally
anticipates the possibility of forming an organization proper, allied in
spirit with similar organizations around the world including the
Electronic Frontier Foundation (U.S.), Electronic Frontiers Canada, and
Electronic Frontiers Australia.



1. POTENTIAL TOPICS

The list is unmoderated and any topics which subscribers feel are
relevant to the list are welcome.  We anticipate that topics may
include, but not be limited to:

- The role of government agencies (MITI, MPT, etc.) and communications
service providers (NTT, IIKK, AT&T Jens, IIJ, JCIX, NCC, and more) in
the formation of Japan's communications policy.

- Effective lobbying methods and sources of publicity for impacting
Japan's expansion into the electronic frontier.

- Freedom and privacy issues as seen in the context of electronic
communications, and how Japanese culture may differ from western culture
in its approach to these topics.

- Electronic Frontiers Japan, the organization:  is there general
support for such an entity, and if so how should it be structured,
funded, and directed?

- The cultural and social issues involved in linking to international
networks.  In particular, issues in linking to the Internet, which is
arguably strongly imprinted with western cultural values and within
which English has to date been the dominant language.

- On-line databases and other resources for research on Japan's networks.

- How individuals in Japan can connect to the Internet and other
networks (Fido systems, non-Fido BBSes, etc.), and information for
system administrators and BBS operators on how to get connected.

- Contact and pricing information for Internet service providers,
ranging from companies providing high-speed leased line services to
sites offering dial-in services for individuals.  However, blatant
advertising is discouraged.

- Subnetworks and links in Japan (WIDE, JUNET, BITNET, etc), as well as
technical standards (TCP/IP vs. OSI).

- Usenet news, gopher, ftp, telnet, WWW, and similar network-based
services in Japan.

- Reposts of public information from other sources, i.e. Usenet,
Niftyserve, etc.  Responsibility for adhering to copyright restrictions
rests with the poster.



2. LANGUAGE

Mail to the list may be in English, Japanese, or both.  We hope to see
participation from a wide variety of interest groups and from both
Japanese and non-Japanese.  If you are posting in English, please be
aware that your post will be read by non-native speakers of English.  If
you are posting in Japanese, please be aware that many sites outside of
Japan are not running Japanese terminal programs.  In other words, if
you post in Japanese we anticipate that not all subscribers will have
the technological means to read your message.

Software for displaying JIS-encoded text is available for a wide variety
of machines at numerous ftp sites.  Please try to refrain from posting
queries on this topic to the list; instead, please obtain a copy of the
sci.lang.japan FAQ from Usenet or request one from Bruce Hahne,
hahne@acm.org.

Subject: File 9--New Dye Sub Printer

          Photo-Quality Color Printing Becomes Affordable
                        by David Batterson

EDEN PRAIRIE, MN--Last year the FARGO Primera Color Printer was
introduced, offering high-quality thermal transfer printing at an
affordable cost ($995 list).  Now FARGO adds dye sublimation color
printing, via a Photo-Realistic Upgrade Kit ($249.95 list, PC, Mac or
Amiga).

     If you print a lot of GIF graphics and Photo-CD files, or do any
presentation graphics, newsletters and other color DTP work, the
FARGO Primera is a good deal, as it's much more affordable than usual
dye-sub color printers.  The latter can run $7,000 and up; it'll cost
you $9.995 list for the Tektronix Phaser IISDX.

     According to Mark D. Strobel, FARGO's Sales & Marketing VP,
"there are all kinds of photo packages that people are now buying for
business and scientific applications, for 3-D renderings and
multimedia--for dozens of applications.  They are not going to spend
$7000 for a printer."

     The Photo-Realistic Upgrade Kit consists of the 10-print photo
ribbon, 10 sheets of special paper (actually polyester), a spare
ribbon cartridge holder and the software driver.  A Photo-Realistic
Refill Kit (25 prints) lists for $89.95.

     Besides the photo-realistic output, the Primera printer prints
with thermal transfer or laser paper, transparency film, and T-shirt
transfer paper.  Strobel recommends that you use the regular 3-color
ribbon ($45, 115 prints) or 4-color ribbon ($45, 80 prints) for
proofs, then "drop in the dye sub ribbon, and print your final
print."

     The FARGO Primera is very compact, measuring 13.8" by 10.2" by
5.8", and weighs only 15 pounds.  It prints pretty fast for a color
printer, although it slows down to a crawl in photo-realistic mode.
The print quality is quite outstanding.  The printer uses four paper
sizes: A, A4, A-Long and AR-Long.

     FARGO was one of the largest manufacturers of bar code printers
in the world, but sold its bar code printer division last year to
Datamax, Inc.  The Primera is sold via computer dealers, VARs and
directly from FARGO.
