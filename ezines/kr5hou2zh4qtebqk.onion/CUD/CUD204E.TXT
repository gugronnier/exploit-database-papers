GUBERNATORIAL CANDIDATE SUPPORTS ELECTRONIC FREEDOM & PRIVACY

Folks, we have a good chance of having a **State Governor** who
(a) understands and favors technology, and -- more important --
(b) has signed and released the following statement (I just received a
signed, dated copy by fax; I will fax it to anyone who requests it).

-- Jim Warren, 9/16/90  [jwarren@well.sf.ca.us,   or   415-851-7075/voice]

        STATEMENT BY JIM GALLAWAY, CANDIDATE FOR GOVERNOR OF NEVADA

I am the Republican candidate for Governor of the State of Nevada.  I have
been in the private telecomm industry for most of 20 years, and have been a
principal in several telecomm and computer start-ups.  I understand,
support, and have practiced technological innovation.

My wife and I have known Jim Warren for well over a decade.  He has
outlined some of the current issues about which owners and users of systems
for e-mail, BBS, teleconferencing, electronic publishing and personal
computing are deeply concerned.

These are my positions, relative to some of the recent law enforcement
practices by some government agents:

1.  Government responses to alleged misdemeanors and crimes must be no more
than comparable to the seriousness of the wrong-doings.
2.  Simple electronic trespass without harm must be treated as any other
simple trespass.  It does not justify armed raids on teenagers, forced
entry of private homes, nor seizure of telephone handsets, answering
machines, computer printers, published documentation, audio tapes and the
like.
3.  The notion that equipment can be "arrested" and held inaccessible to
its owner, without promptly charging the owner with a crime, is absolutely
unacceptable.  The practice of holding seized equipment and data for months
or years is a serious penalty that must be imposed only by a court of law
and only after a fair and public hearing and judicial finding of guilt.
4.  Teleconferencing and BBS systems must have the same protections against
suppression, prior restraint, search or seizure as do newspapers, printing
presses and public meeting places.
5.  The contents of electronic-mail and of confidential or closed
teleconferencing exchanges must have the same protections against
surveillance or seizure as does First Class Mail in a U.S. Post Office, and
private discussions among a group in a home or boardroom.

As Governor of the State of Nevada I will vigorously support all of these
positions -- both statewide and nationally.

/s/ Jim Gallaway, candidate for the Governor of Nevada  [dated] 9/16/90
