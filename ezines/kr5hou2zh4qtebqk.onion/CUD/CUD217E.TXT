***  CuD #2.17: File 5 of 7: Earning your Stripes                ***
********************************************************************

In an article by Katie Hafner entitled "Morris Code", she describes a long
standing tradition that computer security experts have earned their stripes
by defeating the computer's barriers. But now instead of earning pin
stripes, hackers are earning their prison stripes for defeating computer's
barriers. What has happened to change the norms and values in the computer
world in the last 10 to 15 years?

Now it is a crime to pursue forbidden unlawful computer knowledge.  Just
recently the "Atlanta Three" (Robert Riggs, Adam Grant and Franklin Darden)
have been sentenced to prison terms for breaking into the BellSouth
computer systems.  It is stated by the government that these individuals
have a vast knowledge concerning computer and telecommunication services.
So with this aptitude they are being sent to prison where they might learn
a lesson. What lesson might they learn, I do not know.  It is hard to
believe that the government would not impose a fine on them and community
service similar to what Morris received (but then again I bet none of their
fathers are at the NSA..or could afford the lawyers Morris's family
provided their son).

I think the "Atlanta Three" should be viewed as technological clepto
maniacs.  They would pursue information and knowledge even though they knew
the means were illegal.  You could say that their value system of right and
wrong was skewed. But is this a reason to imprison these young men?  Their
critics site the millions of dollars lost (just like the thousands of
dollars for the 911 manuscript ....it's revised net value is under $20 now)
and the threat to life they could have caused through network disruption.
The key words are COULD HAVE CAUSED. They never actually caused loss of
life or injury to anyone. If that was the case, I would drive them to
prison myself.

So the federal government has issued a message to hackers and phreaks, that
the only stripes you can earn now are prison stripes.
