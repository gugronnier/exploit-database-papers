                           IMAGINE
   (tune by John Lennon; Words by Roberta Barlow)

Imagine there's no mainframe,
     it almost makes me cry.
No links connecting
     all the countryside.
Imagine all the ppl living without relay-ay-ay-ay-ay-ay.
You may say i'm addicted,
     but i'm not the only one.
I hope someday to get a real life,
     bit compu's so much fun!

Imagine all the bit-families
     dissolved one by one,
All the nodes disintegrated,
     link-death everyone.
Imagine all the nightmare
     of an endless, blacked-out scree-ee-ee-ee-ee-een.
You may say i'm addicted,
     but i'm not the only one.
I hope someday you'll join up
     and we can talk over comp.

Imagine there are no print-outs
     of your favorite files,
No skipping classes
     to chat across the miles.
Imagine all the ppl living without relay-ay-ay-ay-ay-ay.
You may say i'm addicted,
     but it's just the way i get.
I hope someday you'll join up
     and we can talk through bit-net.
