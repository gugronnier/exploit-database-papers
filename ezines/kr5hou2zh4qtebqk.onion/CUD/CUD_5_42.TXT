Subject: File 1--UPDATE #11-AB1624: Passed the Assembly, More to Do!

Monday, June 7, 1993

      *YOU* CAN DO SOMETHING!      YOU *CAN* MAKE A DIFFERENCE!

  The *only* thing that forced AB1624 out of Burton's Rules Committee,
and the *only* thing that has moved it forward has been the flood of
LETTERS, FAXES and PHONE CALLS from individuals and organizations
urging its passage.

This contains:
1.  Summary/specifics of what's happened, to date.
2.  Next steps in running the legislative gauntlet.
3.  What you can do that is NEEDED and EFFECTIVE.
4.  Contact information for essential State Senators - needing action, now.


WHAT'S HAPPENED, SO FAR

3/4, AB1624 was introduced by bill-author Debra Bowen, mandating
public access but giving no implementation or cost details.

4/19, the Assembly Rules Committee Chaired by John Burton (D-San
Francisco) decided to be the first committee to hear the bill - a
brief hearing ending with Burton asking for implementation details.

5/4, through Bowen, I submitted a 16-page implementation plan for free
distribution via the nonprofit, nonproprietary public Internet
(gatewayed to Fidonet and Majornet BBSs, CompuServe, GEnie, Delphi,
MCImail, Bitnet, etc.).

5/18, Bowen amended the bill (Update #10) to mandate control/fees for
service providers that charge if they "republish or otherwise
duplicate" these public records, a fee mandate she felt was essential
to get the bill out of Rules.

5/24, after five postponements, Rules reheard the bill passing it, 8
to 0 (Barbara Lee [D-Alameda] was absent, in Africa).

  KEY ISSUES:  Burton sought testimony from Legi-Tech and State Net, the two
largest current buyers and resellers of the data.  Although they had just
hired a leading lobbyist to work against the bill, they didn't publicly
oppose this public access; said they just wanted to protect their current
access (they apparently get the data before it's printed for the public).
  Most other committee members focused on opposing the newly-added fee
requirement.  Burton had wanted the fee requirement, but said it could be
deleted in the Senate.  Bowen said she'd just as
soon delete it, right then.  Burton *heatedly* responded that he'd just
as soon that she *not* - that it could be deleted in the Senate.

*IMPORTANT*:  Burton said he wanted the bill to return to his Rules
Committee after the Senate finished with it.  He can still kill it.

6/3, the Assembly Ways & Means Committee chaired by John Vasconsellos
(D-Santa Clara) passed it as amended May 18th, 21 to 0 - even though the
Legislative Counsel estimated it would cost $50,000 to implement (7 to 10
times what I and several network experts had estimated).

6/7 at 2:21 p.m., the full Assembly passed the bill 72 to 0, in its
May 18th amended form that retains the fee requirement.  (It's officially
78 to 0; legislators can change their vote later, as long as the result's
unchanged. Jus' one of those little legislative rules.)


NEXT STEPS
  Bill-author Bowen is amending the bill to (1) remove the fee and use
controls, (2) limit legislative monitoring of individuals requesting
legislative data, (3) assure *timely* public access, and (4) make clear
that information is to be distributed [at least] via the Internet.

There is no *official* opposition to the bill, to date.  However,
the [unelected] Legislative Counsel and [unelected] Assembly Chief
Administrative Officer have clearly opposed it, and Legi-Tech and
State Net are known to be "working the halls" against it.

Experienced observers also predict that the [unelected] Chief Executive
Officer of the Senate, Cliff Berg, will also fight it, but predict he will
do it almost-entirely behind the scenes.


YOU CAN ...
1.  Write Bowen's office *and* your representatives, as an INDIVIDUAL.
2.  Write or fax as a BUSINESS or ORGANIZATION, if you're its decision-maker.
3.  Urge your company or organization to write or fax their support.
4.  Urge your city council, county supervisors, school boards, city attorney,
public defender, district attorney, county clerk, water district, parks
district, etc., to write or fax their support, so *they* can have online,
timely, economical access to legislation impacting *them*.
5.  Write [brief!] letters to the editor of daily and weekly newspapers.
6.  Call the Editorial Page Editor and/or Editor of your newspaper - they
*should* be interested in public access to public records.
7.  San Franciscans:  *Please* contact John Burton, a *key,* hesitant vote:
  Hon. John Burton, State Capitol, Room 3152, voice: 916-445-8253
And copy your comments to Hon. Willie Brown, Room 219, Sacramento CA 95814

Write your Assembly Member and your State Senator.  State your support and
reasons - in one page or less.

*Especially* important: Send copies to:
  Hon. Debra Bowen, State Capitol, Room 3126, Sacramento CA 95814
  voice: 916-445-8528,  fax: 916-327-2201 [faxes are welcomed].
NOTE:  Some legislators discard letters and faxes from anyone outside of
their districts.  They rarely pass them along to bill-author Bowen.
(And remember, they have your district voter registration record available
at the touch of a keyboard - part of the Legislature's online systems.)


ARE THESE YOUR REPRESENTATIVES?
At least one or two State Senate committees will hear the bill, after
these new amendments.  These are the Senate committees most likely to hear
it next [mail to: Sen. XXX, State Capitol, Room XXXX, Sacramento CA 95814].

+////////////////Quoted message follows//////////////////////////////

A number of times Rusty and Edie's BBS has been brought up here with a
number of people saying "I think they got what they deserved" etc.
Well I decided to do some research into the matter and want to let
some of you out there know some facts that I can relate, there are
some I cannot at this point, but will relate when I am allowed to do
so.

First off, R&E was receiving about 40-50 MEGS of new files daily at
the time their system was raided.  I think you will agree that it is
hard for someone to check out all 40-50 megs of these files to
determine if they were commercial or not.  In fact, many files were
uploaded, commented, and downloaded before the sysops had a chance to
inspect them.  This may not be the "safest" way to run a BBS, in other
words some sysops don't allow users to D/L a file until the sysop has
checked it out first.  I would have to agree that I couldn't check
40-50 Megs of files per day, nor would I want to unless someone was
paying me a lot of $$$ and even then I don't know if I could.

R&E was carrying tens of thousands of files online.  When the warrant
was issued (and the warrant is on public record so I can talk about
it) the authorities included a nearly 200 page list of files with the
warrant.  Among that 200 pages were 2 files underlined that were of
commercial nature and that the authorities felt were enough to go
after the system.

Was the raid carried out properly?  According to the Steve Jackson
games case handed down, NO.  Is the government still in violation by
keeping R&E's equipment without copying the allegedly illegal items
and returning the equipment?  Probably yes from what I have seen.

I hope to have the complete text of the warrant available soon so that
I can post it.

I can also relate that R&E aren't going to take this sitting down,
they have some people on their side.

I can also relate that R&E were subsequently smeared by a couple of
people after the raid took place.  I believe R&E could have a
defamation case against a number of people, and in my opinion could
successful pursue that in court.

I have seen messages were people have said "Oh I sent email to the
sysops that they had commercial programs online and they never
responded".  I do not know if this is true or not in any specific
instance, but I do know that on some days R&E sysops got over 100
pieces of email a day.  I don't know if I could sit through reading
that much either.  This may be a prime case of a system getting to
large to handle without more bodies, but I don't know that for sure,
only a possible explanation.

I would like to keep the discussion of R&E's BBS to a factual level.
If you have specific questions I can consult with the powers that be
and see if I can get you some sort of answer.  If you have specific
factual information about the situation that you can back up, I would
be more than happy to hear it and to keep a record of it for trial
should this case continue through the trial stages.

Finally, I would like to state that it is SAFE to call R&E's BBS, your
lines are not being monitored, the FBI won't be showing up at your
door, and if you had email intercepted by the authorities previously,
or in the future, the Steve Jackson games case would seem to say that
if you join in the suit, you are entitled to at LEAST $1000 in
statutory damages from the government.  As has been pointed out here
time and time again, I think many sysops may be unaware of when they
could incur legal liability for a number of actions, I am by no means
judging R&E's case, but I would like to ask that others don't judge it
as well, especially those who are feeding on rumors.

Subject: File 3--Timeline for a Network History

Since a number of you have requested my fragmentary timeline for
networking history, I have provided what I have below.  I would
appreciate any comments, especially corrections or additions.  I know
there are massive parts of netdom missing, such as....

        - the references to the development of UNIX I thought would lead
          to the intro of UUCP and then USENET newsfeeds.  but I have
          nothing on them yet.

        - I would like to include more on commercial services. I ran across
          a mention of vint cerf working on MCImail, but I believe that
          compuserve and sprintmail also joined internet at least as email
          datagram stub gateways about the same time.  in general I would
          like to include startup dates of more visible commercial services
          (bix, genie, prodigy, etc) and when they join the internet club.
          I roughly remember when compuserve joined.   america online and
          delphi did just a few months ago.  delphi (i think) is the first
          pay-for-play available to the common joe in the general public
          that offers tcp/ip at a reasonable cost-- I am told $3/mo for 10M
          throughput (not data storage).

        - I would like more information on european networks.  I was given
          email address of the janet liaison in uk, but they did not reply.
          I have found a repository of network summaries for some 3rd world
          countries, but little or nothing on europe.

       -  bbs development and grassroot networks like fidonet and frednet
          deserve some recognition.  I have some stuff about fidonet, but
          there are bbs I remember from years ago (like toad's hall) and
          some of these are still around.

       -  I would include more on the underground-- like the legion of doom
          and the first viruses.  I suspect ftp.eff.com has stuff like that
          but I have not had the time to snoop around there yet.


  well, you are welcome to my little scholarship here.  I would appreciate
any anecdotes of personal memories and observations of network activities.
it these which make histories interesting rather than just regurgitation of
mechanical dates.

                      - NSFnet routing database has doubled ever 12 months
                        for last several years.
                      - current Class B IP nums will run out in late 1994
                        at this rate
                      - will run out of IP network nums before host nums.

                  2. Routing table explosion

                      - limits in high-end router memory
                        16000 routes max will exceed this early 1994.
                      - plans to ship new routers 64000 routes max
                        adequate to 1996.
                      - human operators eventually will be unable
                        to configure routing tables and monitor traffic.

Subject: File 4--Re: Fingerprinting Welfare Recipients in CA

In response to Jim Davis's  comments on computerized finger-printing of
wellfare recipients in California (CuD 5.41), I'd like to make the
following comments:

>THE SYSTEM IS UNNECESSARY.

That depends on who you are and what your interests in the matter
are. Insurance companies put all kinds of restrictions on your
behavior when you voluntarily sign their contracts, don't they?
It's not only necessary for them to do so, it's imperative. It
protects their losses.

>AFIRM'S USE CANNOT BE JUSTIFIED FOR THE REASONS GIVEN BY DSS.

Maybe, maybe not. But it's irrelevant. DSS can lawfully implement
any measures they care to, and the recipients have no recourse
except attempting to change the written legislation. That's what
happens to folks who waive Rights at Law, and accept Privileges
(the proverbial "mess o' pottage").

>AFIRM IS FRAUGHT WITH RISKS TO GA RECIPIENTS.

What's there to risk? They already gave up their chance to defend
themselves in court. If you bend over, expect to get porked. If
you go around giving everyone your name and address, expect to get
a few letter bombs along with the valentines and neat CD club
memberships. And if you go around telling everyone everything there
is to know about you, don't be surprised when that information is
copied a few thousand times and ends up available to anyone with the
curiosity to look. This is the digital age. I doubt that anyone
reading CuD isn't already aware of the implications, even if they
haven't followed them all to their logical conclusions.

>DSS has assured the Mayor's office that AFIRM fingerprint
>information will not be shared with police agencies.

Anyone who is foolish enough to believe that line -- or any
similar "assurance" from a government or quasi-government
official -- deserves everything they get.

>...the line between social services and law enforcement is
>becoming increasingly blurred.

This might be due, at least in part, to the increasing amount of
fraud within the system which necessitates criminal investigation
and penalties.

>"Unofficial" use of the data poses additional problems. Data
>stored on a computer is much more prone to unauthorized
>duplication, modification, and transmission than its low-tech
>counterparts...Does DSS have a computer security policy? Who will
>have access to the fingerprint information? What audit trail will be
maintained regarding changes to data on the system?

As I said, we all know that these things happen. So WHY DO WE KEEP
ON GIVING THE INFORMATION AWAY, WHEN WE KNOW THAT THIS IS WHAT
HAPPENS TO IT? WHY DO WE GIVE OUR SANCTION?

When you do something of your own free will, you lose your right
to complain, unless you can show that you were unaware of all the
ramifications at the time of your agreement. Information databases
are growing at enormous rates because of the growing desire of
government and business to know as much as possible about
everyone, true. But the blame lies equally with anyone who has
never asked, "Well, what are you going to do to me if I don't tell
you?" "What are you going to do to me if I don't sign?"

Not very many people care enough about their privacy to go to the
trouble of protecting it. If you don't exercise Rights, you'll end
up not having any. Big Brother may be here, but he didn't come
totally unannounced -- or uninvited.

>AFIRM IS AN AFFRONT TO ANYONE ON WELFARE.
>
>The AFIRM system is based on a presumption of guilt. That is,
>unless you confirm your innocence of not double-dipping, you are
>assumed to be guilty of it. This contravenes a basic
>constitutional principle.

Sorry, but there isn't any Constitutional issue in question here.
Those accepting Privileges from the State are Wards of the State,
and have only the rights a child has in regard to its parents --
i.e., whatever the parent chooses to magnaminously bestow. Rights
aren't something other people can give you.

If people are truly concerned about their Rights, they need to
stop accepting Privileges, and educate themselves as to what the
law in this country says their rights truly are.

>But why stop the program there? Anyone receiving any kind of
>government support, from social security to veterans benefits to
>income tax deductions could be equally culpable of defrauding the
>government. Why not fingerprint them before providing support.
>Who knows where it would end? This is a bad precedent being
>tested on a vulnerable group of San Franciscans.

It could very well come to pass, if people don't quit signing
everything away. Of course, there will always be some ornery folks
out there who won't want any part of it.

>AFIRM SENDS A FALSE MESSAGE ABOUT WELFARE.
>
>It shouldn't need to bear repeating, but being poor is not a
>crime.

[Momentary break from computers and privacy to make a point]

No. But using the gun of government to extort monies from
unwilling third parties is most certainly a crime. Yet the
government has enacted laws that do this. I don't begrudge anyone
for being poor, but I most certainly object to their stealing from
me. If they were to ask for my help, without threatening, my
reaction would be quite different.

Not all laws apply to all people. If you want to protect yourself
to the fullest extent, educate yourself about Status and how to
change it.

>Requiring fingerprinting for receiving benefits reinforces an
>all-too-common perception of criminality. This is a divisive
>message to send to San Franciscans about General Assistance.

If someone wants to convince me that their intentions aren't
criminal, they shouldn't go asking the government to put a gun to
my head and say, "Your money, or your life." I am not saying
people in need should be ignored. But I resent being threatened,
no matter how noble the purpose is claimed to be.

I'll conclude by repeating the golden rule: ANY RIGHT NOT DEMANDED
TIMELY IS ASSUMED WAIVED. In other words, if someone is violating
your Rights, and you don't warn them to cease and desist or face a
lawsuit, you'd better have a darn good reason if you eventually
take it to trial. You might have been unaware of what your Rights
were, at the time. Or you might have been intimidated by threats.
But if you're not interested in claiming and exercising Rights, go
ahead and waive them. Just don't be surprised when the rest of the
world doesn't automatically follow you.

An informed populace is far more dangerous than an angry mob,
because it presents the opportunity for genuine, lasting, peaceful
change for the better.
