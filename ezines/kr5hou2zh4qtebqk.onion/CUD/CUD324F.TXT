***  CuD #3.24: File 6 of 8: Threat of HR 1400 to Modemers       ***
********************************************************************

Why should modemers be concerned about the Bush "war on crime?"
Proposed anti-crime legislation could, if passed, increase the risk
of intrusion of government into the lives of law-abiding citizens.
Among the provisions of HR 1400 (_The Comprehensive Violent Crime
Control Act of 1991_) is a change in 18 USSC (sect) 2709 that expands
the power of the FBI to intrude into the privacy of citizens. An
article in _First Principles_ (June, 1991, p. 6) describes the
proposed revision this way:

     "Sections 743 and 744 {of HR 1400} would grant the FBI
     authority to obtain subscriber information on persons with
     nonpublished telephone numbers, as well as credit records,
     simply by certifying in writing to the telephone company
     or credit bureau that such information is relevant to an
     authorized foreign counterintelligence investigation. The
     proposals would seriously erode current privacy protections
     by giving the FBI authority to obtain these records without
     a subpoena or court order and without notice to the
     individuals that their records have been obtained by
     the bureau."

David Cole (_The Nation_, May 6, 1991, "The Secret Tribunal", p. 581)
describes aspects of the Crime Bill as a return to the seventeenth
century Star Chamber.  We agree with his concern that the expanded
interpretation of the word "terrorism" creates new categories of
people vulnerable to investigation--not on the basis of what they have
done--but rather on the basis of who they may have associated with.
Although looking at a different, but related, provision of the Bill,
Cole's warning is sound: The current crime Bill contains changes that
expand the power of government to curtail fundamental rights.  In
cloaking the rationale and the language in fears of terrorism,
something most rationale people oppose, the Bill, if passed, reduces
jeopardizes a broader number of law-abiding citizens to intrusion and
potential harm by zealous law enforcement agents, and makes it a crime
for other citizens to warn innocent folk of their vulnerability.
Secret police tactics are not the way to create a safe society in
a Constitutional democracy.

Questions about HR1400 can be directed to Ted Vandermede, staff attorney
for the House Criminal Justice subcommittee, at (202) 225-0600.
