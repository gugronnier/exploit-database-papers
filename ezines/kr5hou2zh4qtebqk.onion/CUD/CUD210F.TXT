LEGAL ISSUE

With new laws concerning computer software being changed on a regular basis to
keep users from making copies and "PIRATING" programs I am starting to feel
guilty every time I make a backup of something.  It is so easy to just make a
copy of a program and give it to a friend or to just buy one copy of something
and install it on two computers.

I am between a rock and a hard place.  My situation is that I work for a fairly
good size law firm that has several PCs.  Well the practice of this particular
law firm is to buy three or four copies of a software package and ask me to
install it on 75 machines.  Well I don't quite agree with this but, I also don't
agree with the prices we have to pay for some software.

My dilemma and worry is that if this firm is ever caught and prosecuted can I be
held responsible for doing something I was told to do???

I also have to wonder what kind of society this is when people who practice LAW
don't even abide by it.  What is the point of me obeying the law if, FOR GOD'S
SAKE, my lawyer doesn't?

Someone should check into the firm that is prosecuting Len Rose and any other
hacker for that matter and see if they have purchased every copy of software
installed in their offices.  I bet we could get several cases dropped!!!
