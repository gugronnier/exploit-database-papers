Len Rose / Dr. Ripco Updates
+++++++++++++++++++
 
Progress is often slow, and there is little to report about the Len Rose
and Dr. Ripco situations.  Although the cases are unrelated, both raise
similar issues about law enforcement handling of alleged computer abuse.
Dr. Ripco still remains uncharged, his equipment remains unreturned. Len
Rose still faces trial in February. But, the EFF is currently looking into
both cases to see what legal issues they raise.
