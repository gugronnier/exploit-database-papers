In CuD 3.26, Craig Neidorf looks at the issues surrounding the Len
Rose case from his unique perspective:

I have had considerable first hand experience with the "Justice System"
at a civil level, but never any at the criminal level other than as an
observer because of my profession.

I will always remember what my first lawyer said once, which at the
time I dismissed.  Today though, I am absolutely convinced his comments
are completely true:

"The system ALWAYS works, EXCEPT in individual cases."

Looking specifically at the legal difficulties some individuals have
experienced recently, my belief in the above statement is once again
reconfirmed.

But there is hope!  In the article following Craig Neidorf's posting,
the sentence given Doc Savage in Arizona seems most fair.  Perhaps
there is light at the end of the tunnel.
