Ah, sordid responses and announcements:

1. DON'T FORGET: If you read CuD as Usenet's alt.society.cu-digest,
YOU MUST change over to comp.society.cu-digest. The alt group will
disappear in two weeks.

2. CuD has been coming out twice a week since the shift to the comp
hierarchy. This is temporary, and we'll resume to the normal weekly
schedule in about 2 weeks.

3. We plan three special issues in the next few weeks. One will be a
retrospective on Cliff Stoll's The Cuckoo's Egg. Two others will be
(1) a summary of the Software Publisher's Association followed by (2)
a set of commentaries on the SPA. We are hoping for a third in which
the SPA responds and joins the dialogue.

4. Some Usenet readers had problems reading issue #4.39. We hope we
have the kinks worked out, but if you continue to have problems, let
us know and we'll try to resolve them. The current format of
"Subject:" line, length, and style has been worked out as a compromise
between the variations on different systems.  For readers new to CuD,
we remind ya'll that Usenet readership constitutes less than two-thirds
of all readers, and we have to try to accommodate the other third as
well. If you have problems, let us know, but we can't always resolve
them, especially if they create problems for others.

5. For those wanting back issues: Time (and space) don't allow us mail
out back issues in either electronic or hardcopy format.  Mike
Batchelor has made back issues available via mailserv (see following
file), and other sources of back issues are listed in introduction to
each issue.

Subject: File 2--CuD Back issues now available from the mailserv

((MODERATORS' NOTE: Mike Batchelor has set up a mailserve for
back issues of CuD. Bitnet readers without ftp access will find this
especially helpful. Below are the instructions)).

CuD back issues are in aotd/vol?.zoo.  An index is also
available, which I'll try to keep updated as new back issues are
added.

You may request them from mailserv@batpad.lgb.ca.us as follows:

In the body of your message, place the command

GET aotd/vol?,zoo UUE  <or XXE>
GET aotd/index.zoo UUE  <or XXE>

Use the volume number in place of the question mark.  Wildcards are
not supported, but you may request more than one file in the same
message, one request per line.  Files may be requested either UUencoded
or XXencoded.  The default is to UUencode.

The mailserv will soon implement a QUIT command.  Until then, just
ignore the spurious "Command not supported" message when it eats
your sig.  This is harmless, and does not affect the status of your
request.

You are welcome to request the general INDEX file with the INDEX
command, and retrieve any files that are available from the mailserv.
You may also call The Batchelor Pad PCBoard and download any files on
your first call, no muss, no fuss.  The telephone number is
310-494-8084, 8N1, 2400-14,400 bps V.32bis/V.42bis.

Problems and questions about the mailserv itself should be directed to me,
at the address below.  Questions about the AOTD list should be directed
to Chris at cappucci@crs.cl.msu.edu.

Subject: File 3--Dvorak, Viruses, and Cracking

A Cu-Digest reader recently suggested that John Dvorak's column in the
May 1992 issue of _PC Computing_ was worth a laugh or two.  I eagerly
looked it up at the local library...

Well, I can't honestly say that the librarian tossed me out for
excessive giggling, but I did find some of Dvorak's concepts
interesting.   For example, it appears Mr. Dvorak believes that
anti-cracking laws are responsible for the current wave of computer
virus attacks...

     "...a large group of dedicated hobbyists are writing their
     {virus} code out of boredom.  I think it all stems from the
     new federal law prohibiting computer cracking.  Cracking
     used to keep these kids busy."  (p108)

Hmmmm.  And I suppose before kids kept busy with cracking they used to
shop- lift.  I guess it wasn't coincidence I lost my copy of _Steal
This Book_ a few weeks before I broke into my first minicomputer.  If
only I'd been at the drug store stuffing comic books under my jacket
instead.

Another interesting tidbit found in the same issue is a discussion of
"stealth" viruses.  Yes, viruses that you don't know you have and
can't be detected.  I can't wait for the first 'anti-stealth' virus
protection software.  Reminds me of the old joke about Elephant
Repellent.  "But there aren't any elephants in NYC"..."See how well it
works!." In all seriousness, I've heard of 'stealth' viruses, but
Dvorak is really sounding the alarm in this issue, much to the
amusement of Jim Seymour, his debate opponent on the matter.

Finally, Dvorak treats us to some major 'tsk-tsk'ing' (for our foreign
readers: an expression of moral contempt) over VR and sex.  He says
the entire concept of using Virtual Reality for sexual gratification
or exploration is simply "un-American" (whatever that means).  Oh
Damn, that's exactly what I was going to turn to once the anti-virus
laws kick in.   ::sigh::

When:      Friday December 18 through Sunday December 20, 1992



Somebody call hotel security, we're at it again! Xmas/HoHoCon '92, three
years and running. HoHoCon '91 turned out to be the largest and most chaotic
gathering of any other computer underground conference ever, yet it was also
the most organized and well planned. Everything from party ball soccer to
interhotel telegrams from Cliff Stoll to elite cYbuR-strippers, and everyone
from Bruce Sterling to Erik Bloodaxe & Doc Holiday of Comsec to K0DE WARRI0R
himself. It was also the first conference to produce .gifs, a definite new
trend. How we got away with it is still a mystery, and how we'll top it,
I just don't know. But you can bet we're gonna try! We're looking to get an
even larger group of people from the computer underground, computer
security, media, and telecommunications world together to discuss a variety
of topics. Still no ego trip either, the event will once again be open to
the public so that anyone may attend, and everyone is encouraged to
participate in the activities.


                           Hotel Information
                           ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This year, we've moved the conference from Intercontinental Airport to Hobby
Airport. This was mainly due to conference room availability and room
pricing. It shouldn't create an inconvenience as most airlines service both
Airports.

The Hobby Airport Howard Johnson's Lodge is located almost directly across
the street from the entrance of the airport (approximately one block west if
facing the airport). The HoHoCon group room rates are $41.00 plus tax (15%)
per night, your choice of either single or double. There are also 2 suites
available, a mini and a large. You can call the hotel for pricing and
availability of the suites. Once again, when you make your reservations
(800-654-2000, which is also reachable from Houston), you will need to tell
them you are with the HoHoCon Conference to receive the reduced room rate,
otherwise you will be shelling out $59.00. There is no charge for children,
regardless of age, when they occupy the same room as their parents.
Specially designed rooms for the handicapped are available. The hotel
provides free on call transportation to and from the airport. The hotel
restaurant, The Mulberry Tree, is open from 6 a.m. to 10 p.m. Meal prices
range between $5 and $10, with breakfast being closer to $5 and dinner
closer to $10. There is also a buffet available for $6.95. The hotel bar,
The Hobby Saloon, is open from 2 p.m. to 2 a.m. and features the general
assortment of table games and bar attractions. There is an outdoor pool and
an exercise room. Car rental agencies are located in the lobbies of both the
hotel and airport. Unlike last year, there will be no need to hack the
television sets as the hotel provides free cable tv, which includes HBO
(don't know about those wonderfully edited R rated hotel pornos yet, kidz).
Check-in and check-out times are both 12:00 noon. Earlier check-in is
allowed if there are rooms available. If you need further information,
contact us or the hotel directly.

If you are only able to get a flight into Intercontinental Airport, there is
a shuttle that will take you to Hobby for $11.50. Departures start at 10
a.m. and continue until 10 p.m., leaving every hour on the hour. For more
information contact the Hobby Airport Limousine Service at (713) 644-8359.

Similar to last year, the hotel is placing the HoHoCon guests (those renting
rooms) in their own building (smart move). Thus, we are encouraging people
to make their reservations as early as possible to ensure themselves a room
in our building. As of this writing, there are 6 rooms reserved and there is
a total of 40 rooms in the building.


                                 Directions
                                 ~~~~~~~~~~

If you plan to drive to the conference, plan your route to get you to
Interstate 45. From there, if you are coming from the North (which most of
you will be), take I-45 South to the Broadway exit. Make a right on Broadway
and drive down for about a mile or so until you come to Airport Boulevard
(you will be right in front of the airport at this point). Make a right
on Airport Boulevard and the hotel is one block down on the right.

If you are coming from the South, take I-45 North to Airport Boulevard. Go
left on Airport Boulevard and the hotel will be on the right, one block
past the airport.


                             Conference Details
                             ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

HoHoCon will last 3 days, with the actual conference being held on Saturday,
December 19, starting at 11:00 a.m. or 12:00 noon, depending on the number
of speakers, and continuing until 4:30 p.m. The reason for having to vacate
the conference room so early is because there is a Christmas party following
our conference. Hopefully, the partiers will get so drunk, loud and
obnoxious that the hotel staff won't have the time to pay attention to us.

This is actually a pre 'official announcement', so at this point, we don't
exactly have all of the conference itself planned. We are still in the midst
of arranging times and confirming speakers. We would like to have a number
of people speak on a varied assortment of topics. If you would like to
speak, please contact us as soon as possible and let us know who you are,
who you represent (if anyone), the topic you wish to speak on, a rough
estimate of how long you will need, and whether or not you will be needing
any audio-visual aids. The main announcement will probably be going out in
three weeks, and we will be releasing updates every three to four weeks
after that.

We would like to have people bring interesting items and videos again this
year, so if you have anything you think people would enjoy having the chance
to see, please let us know ahead of time, and tell us if you will need any
help getting it to the conference. If all else fails, just bring it to the
con and give it to us when you arrive. We will also include a list of items
and videos that will be present in a future update.

We received a nice amount of media support last year in the form of
pre-conference announcements and would greatly appreciate the same this
year. Besides our updates, you will most likely be able to get HoHoCon
details from CuD, Informatik, Mondo 2000, and Phrack Magazine. If you are a
journalist and would like to do a story on HoHoCon 92, or know someone who
would, contact us with any questions you may have, or feel free to use and
reprint any information in this file.

If anyone requires any additional information, needs to ask any questions,
wants to RSVP, or would like to be added to the mailing list to receive the
HoHoCon updates, you may write myself (Drunkfux) or any of the other
HoHoCon planning committee members (uh... whoever they may be) at:


                          dfx@nuchat.sccsi.com

For those without net access, we'll list a few boards to reach us on in the
upcoming announcement, as well as a P.O. Box. Currently, your best bet would
be to try any of the cDc systems. Mainly, Demon Roach Underground -
(806) 794-4362, Login: THRASH, NUP: Jihad (I think).

HoHoCon 92 will be a priceless learning experience for professionals (yeah,
right) and gives journalists a chance to gather information and ideas direct
from the source. It is also one of the very few times when all the members
of the computer underground can come together for a realistic purpose. We
urge people not to miss out on an event of this caliber, which doesn't
happen very often. If you've ever wanted to meet some of the most famous
people from the hacking community, this may be your one and only chance.
Don't wait to read about it in all the magazines, and then wish you had
attended, make your plans to be there now! Be a part of what we hope to be
our largest and greatest conference ever.


Remember, to make your reservations, call (800) 654-2000 and tell them
you're with HoHoCon.
