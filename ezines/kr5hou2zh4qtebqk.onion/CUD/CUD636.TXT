     ***ABOUT IFIP'S TECHNICAL COMMITTEE 11

     The International Federation for Information Processing was  established
     in 1960 under sponsorship of UNESCO. In 1984 the Technical Committee for
     Security and Protection in  Information  Processing  Systems,  Technical
     Committee  11, came into existence. Its aim is to increase the reliabil-
     ity and general confidence in information processing, as well as to  act
     as a forum for security managers and others professionally active in the
     field of information processing  security.  Its  scope  encompasses  the
     establishment  of  a frame of reference for security common to organiza-
     tions, professionals and the public; and the promotion of  security  and
     protection as essential parts of information processing systems.

     Eight working groups: Information  Security  Management,  Small  Systems
     Security,  Database  Security,  Network  Security, Systems Integrity and
     Control, Security Legislation, Information  Security  Education  and  IT
     Related  Crime  Investigations,  all  chaired  by seasoned international
     experts, cover a major part of the actual TC 11 workload.
 +----------------------------------------------------------

     ***ABOUT THE TENTH INTERNATIONAL INFORMATION SECURITY CONFERENCE

     This event is the Tenth in a series of conferences on information  secu-
     rity.   Something  to  celebrate.  The  organizers have compiled a truly
     exceptional, unique, and especially upgraded  conference  in  a  setting
     suitable for celebrating its Tenth birthday. Over 75 sessions will cover
     just about all aspects of information security, on a senior and advanced
     level.  The  formal  language  of SEC'94 is English. The proceedings are
     published by Elsevier North Holland in its acclaimed series.

     There are evidently some astounding  surprises  within  SEC'94.  As  key
     note's  SEC'94  will feature major players. Ten invited speakers, doubt-
     less seasoned seniors in their field, will contribute with their  vision
     of the future.  Ranging from the legislative aspects of data privacy, to
     the international impact of the Clipper chip, and the dimensions of  new
     cryptographic  standards  and  applications.  Global  policy  making and
     breaking in respect of the international harmonization efforts of infor-
     mation  technology security evaluation criteria, and other most enticing
     issues are advocated during the various invited lectures.


     Within the framework of this conference a series of special lectures are
     built in, dedicated to one most important aspect. SEC'94 includes a UNIX
     system security workshop and a cryptology tutorial. Special sessions are
     devoted  to  information security in developing nations, and information
     security in the banking and financial industry. Two major full day  mini
     conferences  "IT Security Evaluation Criteria" and "Open Systems Network
     Security" are included in the program as well.  SEC'94  offers  a  panel
     discussion  of  the editors of Elseviers Journal Computers and Security,
     IFIP TC 11's formal journal.


     ***ABOUT YOU

     Each of the past ten years you have shown IFIP and TC 11 in  particular,
     your  commitment  to  information  security  by  attending  the IFIP SEC
     conferences.  The visitors and delegates to IFIP SEC are a  broad  audi-
     ence,  from  everywhere:  The Pacific Rim, Europe, Africa, the North and
     Latin America's and the Far East. The level of authority/positions is as
     usual:  within  practical,  management,  legal  and technical level, the
     delegate to IFIP SEC is considered the top grade. Anyone - directly  and
     indirectly  -  involved and/or interested in information security, wher-
     ever she/or he may live, is IFIP SEC's audience.  You certainly may  not
     miss SEC'94!


     ***SOMETHING EXTRA

     The organizers wanted to  do  something  extra  for  this  Tenth  event.
     Besides  compiling  a unique conference program, its length was extended
     to FIVE days, extra tracks are added, the delegate admission is reduced,
     special  student  admission  rate  are available, Worldwide rebated air-
     travel and discounted hotel accommodation can be obtained, and those not
     yet  being a member of the World's largest and most influencial computer
     society are being offered a free of  charge  membership  for  1994!  And
     that's not all! Yet, some surprises are saved for the event itself.

                   IFIP TC 11's SEC'94 welcomes you to Curacao,
                                    BONBINI !

                                   A W A R D S
     Technical Committee 11 of IFIP presents during its 10th event two  pres-
     tigeous  awards.  The  Kristian  Beckman Award and the Best Paper Award.
     The Kristian Beckman Award has been established by IFIP TC  11  to  com-
     memorate  the  first  chairman  of  the committee, Kristian Beckman from
     Sweden, who was also responsible for promoting its founding in  1983/84.
     This  award is granted annually to a successful nominee and is presented
     at the annual IFIP Security Conference. The objective of the award is to
     publicly recognize an individual - not a group or organization - who has
     significantly contributed to the development  of  information  security,
     especially achievements with an international perspective.

     To celebrate the tenth annual conference  the  organizers  have  decided
     also  to  present a Best Paper Award. The award will be presented to the
     individual with the most  significant  paper  at  SEC'94.  The  audience
     itself will be selecting this presentation/individual.

Subject: File 2--DEF CON ][ Late Night Hack Announcement #3

Updated Last : 3.11.1994 (I appologise for spelling errors.. the WP died)
Late Night Hack Announcement #3


What's this?  This is an updated announcement and invitation to DEF CON II,
a convention for the "underground" elements of the computer culture.  We try
to target the (Fill in your favorite word here): Hackers, Phreaks, Hammies,
Virii Coders, Programmers, Crackers, Cyberpunk Wannabees, Civil Liberties
Groups, CypherPunks, Futurists, Artists, Etc..

WHO:   You know who you are, you shady characters.
WHAT:  A convention for you to meet, party, and listen to some speeches
       that you would normally never hear.
WHEN:  July 22, 23, 24 - 1994 (Speaking on the 23rd and 24th)
WHERE: Las Vegas, Nevada @ The Sahara Hotel

So you heard about DEF CON I, and want to hit part II?  You heard about the
parties, the info discussed, the bizarre atmosphere of Las Vegas and want to
check it out in person?  Load up your laptop muffy, we're heading to Vegas!

Here is what Three out of Three people said about last years convention:

"DEF CON I, last week in Las Vegas, was both the strangest and the best
computer event I have attended in years." -- Robert X. Cringely, Info World

"Toto, I don't think we're at COMDEX anymore." -- CodeRipper, Gray Areas

"Soon we were at the hotel going through the spoils: fax sheets, catalogs,
bits of torn paper, a few McDonald's Dino-Meals and lots of coffee grounds.
The documents disappeared in seconds."  -- Gillian Newson, New Media Magazine

DESCRIPTION:

Last year we held DEF CON I, which went over great, and this year we are
planning on being bigger and better.  We have expanded the number of
speakers to included midnight tech talks and additional speaking on Sunday.
We attempt to bring the underground into contact with "legitimate" speakers.
Sure it's great to meet and party with fellow hackers, but besides that we
try to provide information and speakers in a forum that can't be found at
other conferences.

While there is an initial concern that this is just another excuse for the
evil hackers to party and wreak havok, it's just not the case.  People come
to DEF CON for information and for making contacts.  We strive to distinguish
this convention from others in that respect.

WHAT'S NEW THIS YEAR:

This year will be much larger and more organized (hopefully) than last year.
We have a much larger meeting area, and have better name recognition.
Because of this we will have more speakers on broader topics.  Expect
speaking to run Saturday and Sunday, ending around 5 p.m.  Some of the new
things expected include:

o An Internet connection with sixteen ports will be there, _BUT_ will only
  provide serial connections because terminals are too hard to ship.  So
  bring a laptop with communications software if you want to connect to the
  network.  Thanks to cyberlink communications for the connection.

o There will be door prizes, and someone has already donated a Cell Phone
  and a few "Forbidden Subjects" cd ROMs to give away, thanks to Dead Addict.

o Dr. Ludwig will present his virus creation awards on Sunday.

o A bigger and better "Spot The Fed" contest, which means more shirts to
  give away.

o More room, we should have tables set up for information distribution.
  If you have anything you want distributed, feel free to leave it on the
  designated tables.  Yes, this year there will be a true 24 hour
  convention space.

o A 24 hour movie / video suite where we will be playing all type of
  stuff.
  VHS Format.  Mail me with suggested titles to show, or bring your own.
  We'll use a wall projector when not in use by speakers.

o Midnight Tech Talks on Friday and Saturday night to cover the more
  technical topics and leave the days free for more general discussions.

a few (Two?) people and groups, so hopefully things will work out and I can
pass the good news on in the next announcement, or over our List Server.

============================================================================

WHERE THIS THING IS:

It's in Las Vegas, the town that never sleeps.  Really. There are no clocks
anywhere in an attempt to lull you into believing the day never ends.  Talk
about virtual reality, this place fits the bill with no clunky hardware.  If
you have a buzz you may never know the difference.  It will be at the Sahara
Hotel.  Intel is as follows:

        The Sahara Hotel: 1.800.634.6078

        Room Rates: Single/Double $55, Tripple $65, Suite $120
                    (Usually $200) + 8% tax

        Transportation: Shuttles from the airport for cheap.

   NOTE:  Please make it clear you are registering for the DEF CON II
   convention to get the room rates.  Our convention space price is
   based on how many people register.  Register under a false name if
   it makes you feel better, 'cuz the more that register the better for
   my pocket book.  No one under 21 can rent a room by themselves, so
   get your buddy who is 21 to rent for you and crash out.  Try to contact
   people on the Interactive Mailing List (More on that below) and
   hook up with people.  Don't let the hotel people get their hands on
   your baggage, or there is a mandatory $3 group baggage fee.  Vegas
   has killer unions.

OTHER STUFF:

I'll whip up a list of stuff that's cool to check out in town there so if for
some reason you leave the awesome conference you can take in some unreal
sites in the city of true capitalism.  If anyone lives in Las Vegas, I
would appreciate it if you could send a list of some cool places to check out
or where to go to see the best shows and I'll post it in the next
announcement or in the program

-o I am asking for people to submit to me any artwork, pictures, drawings,
   logos, etc. that they want me to try and include in this years program.
   I am tring to not violate any copywrite laws, but wat cool shit.  Send
   me your art or whatever and I'll try and use it in the program, giving you
   credit for the work, of course.  Please send it in .TIF format if it has
   more than eight bit color.  The program will be eight bit black and white,
-o in case you want to make adjustments on your side.

*** NEW MAILING LIST SERVER ***

We've finally gotten Major Dommo List Serv software working (Kinda) and it
is now ready for testing.  MTV spent alot of time hacking this thing to work
with BSDi, and I would like to thank him.  The purpose of the list is to
allow people interested in DEF CON II to chat with one another.  It would
be very sueful for people over 21 who want to rent hotel space, but split
costs with others.  Just mention you have room for 'x' number of people, and
I'm sure you'll get a response from somone wanting to split costs.  Someone
also suggested that people could organize a massive car caravan from Southern
Ca. to the Con.  My attitude is that the list is what you make of it.  Here
are the specifics:

Umm.. I TAKE THAT BACK!!  The mailing list is _NOT_ ready yet.  Due to
technical problems, etc.  I'll do another mass mailing to everyone letting
them know that the list is up and how to access it.  Sorry for the delay!


MEDIA:

Some of the places you can look for information from last year include:

New Media Magazine, September 1993
InfoWorld, 7-12-1993 and also 7-19-1993 by Robert X. Cringely
Gray Areas Magazine, Vol 2, #3 (Fall 1993)
Unix World, ???,
Phrack #44

COST:

Cost is whatever you pay for a hotel room split however many ways, plus
$15 if you preregister, or $30 at the door.  This gets you a nifty 24 bit
color name tag (We're gonna make it niftier this year) and your foot in the
door.  There are fast food places all over, and there is alcohol all over
the place but the trick is to get it during a happy hour for maximum
cheapness.

                                    Details

         *************************************************************

The philosopher Friedrik Nietzsche once said that if you want to kill
something, you must laugh at it--and laugh at it deeply. So there should be
little wonder that political satire is as old as politics itself.

Is there something going on in the political arena that you abhor, that makes
you sick, that is just plain wrong? Well, here's your chance to make a
mockery of it. I've always had this idea that if someone wrote a sufficiently
witty virus that really addressed the issues the way the people (not the
press, not the politicians) saw them, it might just get passed around by
people voluntarily.

Let's find out.

Write a virus that is itself a political satire. I don't mean a virus that
simply displays a message. I mean a living entity whose every move--whose
every action--is politically motivated. If you need more than one virus to
make your point--perhaps two viruses working together, or something like that,
that is fine.

         -----------------------------------------------------------
Let me give you a simple example: The Political Correctness Virus

This virus is a spoof on the "political correctness" movement--which is just
a form of self-imposed censorship--that is sweeping american intellectual
circles, particularly colleges and universities.

This virus is a memory resident boot sector virus which maintains a list of
politically incorrect words on your computer system. It also hooks the
keyboard interrupt and monitors every keystroke you make. If you type a
politically incorrect word into the computer, the PCV springs into action.

Politically incorrect words are ranked at three different offense levels.
When the PCV encounters such a word, it determines what offense level that
word is, and acts accordingly.

The least offensive words merely register a beep. More offensive words cause
a beep to sound for 10 seconds. The most offensive words cause a siren to
sound for two minutes, locking the system for that duration. If you turn the
computer off before the two minutes are up, the virus will stop the boot
process for five minutes, with sirens, when you turn it back on. If you allow
the siren to complete, then you can proceed.

The virus has two different word lists, both stored in an encrypted and
compressed format. The list is selected at random when the system is
infected, after which it cannot be changed. The first list is the "proper"
list of political correctness no-no's. For example, a word like "sodomite" is
among the worst possible offenses. The second list is an inverted list of
no-no's.  This list trys to force you to use "sodomite" by flagging words
like "gay" and "homosexual" as no-no's.

If you allow the PCV to live in your system for three months without getting
a single flag, you are given the supreme honor of viewing the word list
assigned to you and adding a word to it. If you get more than 3000 flags in
a lifetime, the virus will force you to enter a politically correct word
before allowing you to start the computer, since you are obviously unwilling
to submit to its censorship.

The virus also uses powerful means to prevent disinfection, so that, once you
get it, you can't get rid of it
