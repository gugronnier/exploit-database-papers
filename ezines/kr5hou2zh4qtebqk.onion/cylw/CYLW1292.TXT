(Part 1, December)CyberLaw (tm) [12/92]I.  Court Rules That Technology Advances Privacy InterestsAn impassioned dispute has been brewing between government agencies seeking to slow the pace of commercial development in the areas of data encryption and telecommunications, and consumer advocates and a range of computer companies arguing for the broad availability of advanced data encryption and telecommunication systems.  The government agencies argue that the availability of such systems may threaten national security and crime control.  Critics argue that these systems are necessary to protect personal privacy in the "electronic information age."  A recent court ruling in a Texas drug trafficking case may provide increased weight to the critics' position.  In that case, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit ruled that technological advances are capable of expanding the legally-protected range of privacy individuals enjoy.  The decision also appears to hold individuals responsible for attaining a level of technical knowledge sufficient to show that any expectation of privacy sought to be preserved is reasonable, both subjectively and objectively.  (U.S. v. Smith, No. 91-5077 (5th Cir. November 12, 1992).) II.  Arrest and ConvictionIn 1990, David L. Smith lived with his girlfriend in Port Arthur, Texas.  His next-door neighbor had experienced problems with break-ins to his garage and cars, and suspected Smith.  Using a Bearcat scanner designed to scan and intercept 400 "radio-type" channels, the neighbor began to intercept Smith's phone conversations, made in Smith's home over a cordless telephone. Listening to the conversations, the neighbor did not hear anything to tie Smith to the break-ins, but did discover that he was involved in drug dealing.  The neighbor contacted a friend in the local police department, who "instructed and assisted" the neighbor to tape Smith's conversations.  Police officers also participated in the interception and recording of Smith's calls. Based on the intercepted calls, Smith was arrested and charged with drug trafficking.  At trial, Smith requested the suppression of evidence obtained through interception of his phone conversations.  The request was denied, and Smith was convicted.III.  The AppealOn appeal, Smith claimed that the interception and use of the calls in obtaining his conviction was in violation of Title III of the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968 (18 U.S.C. Sections 2510 et seq.)  As described by the Fifth Circuit, "Title III essentially prohibits the nonconsensual interception of 'wire,' 'oral,' and 'electronic' communication without prior judicial approval."  Smith also argued that the interception and use of his calls violated the Fourth Amendment, which bars unreasonable searches and seizures.The Fifth Circuit quickly dismissed Smith's Title III claims.  Although Title III includes an exclusionary rule barring the introduction into evidence of illegally intercepted communications, the Fifth Circuit noted that cordless phone communication is expressly carved out from Title III's coverage.  The exclusion had been made because "some types of cordless communication could be so easily intercepted."      On the Fourth Amendment claim, the Fifth Circuit noted that "what is really involved in Fourth Amendment analysis is our 'societal understanding' about what deserves 'protection from government invasion.'"  The court stated that for a defendant to establish a Fourth Amendment violation, he must "show that a government activity intruded upon a reasonable expectation of privacy in such a significant way that the activity can be called a 'search.'"  He would also have to show that the intrusion was unreasonable given the particular facts of the case.Regarding privacy expectations, Smith reminded the Fifth Circuit that the U.S. Supreme Court has ruled that a person in a phone booth has a justifiable expectation of privacy in his conversation, whether measured subjectively or objectively.  "Obviously," continued Smith, "one who has a telephone conversation in the privacy of his own home is seeking to keep his personal matters private, unless he knows that the conversation is being heard by others."  Because "one has a right to be secure in one's house against unauthorized intrusion against a policeman viewing or seizing tangible property," reasoned Smith, "the home owner's rights are as clearly invaded when the police warrantlessly intrude into the home with a listening device." Smith further advised the Fifth Circuit that the cordless phone at issue was owned by his girlfriend, that he had never read the owner's manual for the phone or owned such a phone, and that he had never been informed that his conversations would not be private.  Although the cordless phone base contained a warning that "privacy of communications may not be insured...," the base was located on a wall and could not be and had not been seen by Smith.  Accordingly, Smith argued that he had a subjective expectation of privacy in his conversations, which society should be prepared to recognize as reasonable.  Additionally, Smith noted that his calls were "not intercepted unintentionally, or by plain radio, or by another cordless telephone.  The interception was an intentional intrusion into [his] privacy through the use of a device specifically designed to intercept transmissions."IV.  The Court Considers Technology and Expectations of PrivacyIn considering these arguments, the Fifth Circuit focused upon the important role that telecommunications play in today's society, observing that "wireless" technology is one of the fastest growing areas in the field of telecommunications, and that cordless phones are threatening to outstrip sales of traditional land line telephones.  According to the court, "the decision as to whether cordless telephone conversations are protected by the Fourth Amendment may ultimately determine whether any telephone conversation is protected by the Fourth Amendment."Where a cordless telephone differs from a normal land line phone is in the cordless phone's use of an actual radio signal.  A cordless phone transmits the signal from a mobile unit to a base unit, which is attached to a land- based telephone line.  A cordless phone also receives radio signals from the base unit.  The radio signals carry the actual conversation.  Although communications carried over land-based telephone lines are clearly protected by the Fourth Amendment, a conversation broadcast into the air by radio waves has been viewed as "more analogous to carrying on an oral communication in a loud voice or with a megaphone...."  In such cases, the person carrying on the call was viewed as knowingly exposing the communication to the public.Courts had ruled in earlier decisions that cordless phone users could have no reasonable expectation of privacy in their calls because of the ease by which the calls could be monitored.  At the time of those decisions, some cordless phones had a range of over 700 feet and were subject to interception by standard radio scanners, radio receivers, and other cordless phones (many of which were pre-set to the same frequency).  The Fifth Circuit noted, however, that more recent cordless phones employ an evolved technology; many are limited in range to about 60 feet, "barely beyond the average house or yard," and are no longer pre-set to the same frequency.  Since cordless phones now transmit on frequencies not utilized by commercial radio, conventional radios can no longer intercept cordless communications.  Although the conversations can be monitored by radio scanners, the court further noted that only a small percentage of the populace own such scanners.  In addition, new cordless phones also incorporate the ability to scramble their signals. Respecting the new technology, the Fifth Circuit discerned that, "Surely the reasonableness of an expectation of privacy becomes greater when the conversation can only be intercepted using specialized equipment not possessed by the average citizen."  "[I]n spite of the fact that a defendant uses a cordless phone," continued the court, "the circumstances may show that he also has a reasonable expectation of privacy."  In this case, however, the Fifth Circuit found that although Smith claimed not to know that his conversations would not be private, he had "introduced absolutely no evidence -- such as the phone's frequency or range -- that would tend to show that his subjective expectation of privacy was reasonable." In light of the above, the Fifth Circuit found that the trial court erred in assuming that there could never be a reasonable expectation of privacy for a cordless telephone communication.  But the court affirmed Smith's conviction, nonetheless, for the reason that "even under a correct application of the law ... [Smith] failed to carry his burden of showing that his Fourth Amendment rights were violated."   (A copy of the Fifth Circuit's decision and other papers concerning this case were kindly made available to the author by Bruce N.
