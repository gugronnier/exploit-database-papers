     I was sitting on IRC, doing my thing, when this idiot came my way.  I
was lucky enough to capture his dribble.  I want the readers of IBFT to
understand something.  Please do not say you understand us.  You are all
fucking worthless losers.  You say you relate to our textfiles, and since we
write about ourselves, we must be losers like you.  Wrong.  We are not losers
like you.  You know why?  Because we fucking say so.  You suck.  We are
better than you.  We are aware.  You are not aware.  You are stupid
brainwashed losers.  If it wasn't for IBFT and Henry Rollins you would be
completely in the dark.
