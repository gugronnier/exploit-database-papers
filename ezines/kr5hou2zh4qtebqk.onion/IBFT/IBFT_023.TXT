               IBFT Syndicate: A New Group for a New Tomorrow
                                by Snarfblat

In an effort to allow more people to take part in IBFT, we have opened our
doors to the public.  We are currently taking submissions for a secondary
project under the IBFT name.  This project will take the form of an
approximately monthly zine, tentatively titled "I'll Hit You Back" after
Jane's Addiction's first label.  It will be an outlet for the confusion of
our generation; a forum in which those who really know what's going on, to
cry out "why the fuck don't we all just die"; a battlefield for your cocked
and loaded angst cannons.  The best part of this, aside from finally getting
yourself heard, is that if we publish you, you are now an official member of
IBFT/Syndicate.

To apply for membership in IBFT syndicate, fill out the following
questionnaire and mail it back along with as many writing submissions as you
want.  If we select you as a member if IBFT Syndicate, we will let you know
before we publish the first issue of the zine.

And please remember that being in the Syndicate does not mean you are in
IBFT.  If you ever claim to be "in IBFT", I'll find out where you live and
stick my finger so far up your mom's ass that it will be way far up there.

Example of how cool you could be:
