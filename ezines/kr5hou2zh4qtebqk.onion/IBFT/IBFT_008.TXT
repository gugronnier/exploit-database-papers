The following is a true story of a tender loving Gothic Boy/Girl that he 
told me.  If anybody questions this story, we can obtain the name, address
phone #, picture, shoe size, hair lint, and vomit sample(fondled and all):


  Once upon a time in the land where rocks are eagles the boy of Gothdom
called PUNCHY(for all practicle purposes)  was shmoozin around in his land
of green flowers with his kiddlin sistar watchin there kanine dogster
squeezin a sweet frump on the bed of green.  At their delight, the        
poochey-kin took of it's precious lawn cigar a wiff of oderiphous sent.    
In one quick smoof mistar woffey-woofer champed down the greasy chunk of 
brownie roll(yummy-yooom-yimmy).
  The powie-pooch then gurgled in extuseey!  AND fountaned his everloving
lumpchinks of mutt-dirt-sculpture over the greeny tundra.  To the     
boogey-eyed stretched-lipped limpin-lobed amazement of the donnie and marie
of the nindies, punky-pupper swiped up his uncle RALPH(a.ka. RALPHOO!ma)   
and swallered his baby-luv for the twise tam.
  This didn't cuddle in nicely with punchy's all knowin luve seete.  There
was gurglin bublin rumplin tumplin good time gone ahn in the old man food
