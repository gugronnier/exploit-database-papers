"What exactly is jive?" you ask.  Well it's how a brother talks!  It's also
great fun when you are feeling miserable.  Whenever something awful or
depressing happens, don't despair, jive it!  An assignment from your boss,
an obituary, or statistics on the AIDS epidemic can all be jived!  This
is the first in a series of many, many files converted to jive.  This one
comes one of our favorite posters on alt.tasteless, Trashcan Man.

Yes, Columbia University is full of wacko revolutionary types who folly 
in thinking they can actually change the world they live in. One of the 
most ardent of these is one Udit Kondal, who has been censured (and 
nearly expelled) from campus for leading an ill-advised building 
takeover. Anyway, you'd think this guy would be a real bleeding heart, so 
what to my surprise when I found in a campus publication called "Folkus" an 
essay by him titled: "I Sexually Assaulted a Young Girl Our Age..."

Here's an excerpt:

"On this night, I once again recall the following act of hate: When I was
13 years old, a friend (Chris) and I sexually assaulted a young girl our
age. The two of us asked her to come into a small apartment building
laundry room. When we entered the room, we closed the door and told her we
wanted "some of her." I held her from behind as Chris grabbed and sucked
on her breasts through her shirt. I then urged Chris to pull up her shirt
and bra and "get to the real thing." I remember she did not say a word,
probably too startled, too frightened to say anything. We then pulled down
her shorts and underwear. I proceeded to take out my erect penis and
attempted to penetrate her anus.  SHe began to cry. She struggled
vehemently. I could not enter her so we decided to let her go. She then
ran out of the laundomat..."

This guy's good enough to be a member of Phi Gamma Delta.

Not being able to resist, I decided I needed to run this excerpt through 
my jive text filter- and what did it output?
