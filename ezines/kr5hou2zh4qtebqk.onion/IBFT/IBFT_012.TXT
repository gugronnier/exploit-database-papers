                           The Poetboy Chronicles
                                by Snarfblat

     This is the first installment in The Poetboy Chronicles.  There will be
many more.  We write about Poetboy because he is an easy target, and anyone
who names himself Poetboy deserves to be tormented.  If you don't believe
that this is a true story, look in the channel #moon on irc.  Poetboy has
been known to use different nicks, but he is always moses@world.std.com.  

Poetboy and the Big Shoe
------------------------

     One day, Poetboy pretended to be sick.  He wanted to stay home from
school and snoop in the attic where his parents told him never to go.  After
he was sure they had gone to work in the mines, he snuck up to the attic and
started to open boxes.  Most of them were empty, except for one.  It was the
biggest box of all, and inside it Poetboy found the biggest shoe he had ever
seen.

     "What could I do with this shoe? I wonder what I should do." rhymed
Poetboy.  First he tried to wear the shoe, but it was much too big.  Then he
poured milk into it and tried to make cereal.  But no matter how much milk he
put in it, it didn't fill up.  He put his dog in, and his dog disappeared.
Then he put his cat in.  Finally he decided to go in.  He went in and fell
asleep for a long time.

     When he woke up his dog and cat raped him and poured milk all over him.
Then they ate him.  They offered him the dignity of killing himself but he
started to write a poem about it so they just shot him.
