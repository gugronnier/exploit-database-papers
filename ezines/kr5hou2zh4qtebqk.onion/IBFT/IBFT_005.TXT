Stolen from rec.music.industrial:

We hate ravers.  They are the scum of the earth.  They are robots, fashion
victims with bad clothes, bad haircuts and seriously substandard drugs.  We
hate skaters.  Get a job, quit clogging the streets.  We hate Goths.  Goth is
dead.  They can't dance because they are too worried about breaking into a
sweat and having their make-up run.  We hate punks, punk is also dead.  The
symbols are meaningless in the 90's.  We hate indie kids: face it, m(orr)isery
is a sad bastard, Robot Smith is a prick and flares really did go out in the
70's.  That also goes for shoegazers because they are "sensitive" pseudo 
intellectual gits who can't dance either.  We hate industrial kids and cyber
punks.  Putting NIN on the back of your jacket does not make you cool.  We
hate Metallers, especially fluffy metallers:  perms are for poodles, open 
shirts are for Burt Reynolds and head banging/air guitar gits who can't play.
We hate crusties:  the new age will not be hastened by wandering the streets
with backpacks, dogs on string, dreads and sitting on your arse listening to
the Levellers or NMA smoking far too much dope.  We hate rap kids: "Yo Homey"
means something in South Central, it means fuck all here.  Most of all we 
hate collective identity:  every day of your pathetic life you are being put 
in a little box by society by the way you look or the bands you listen to.
Collective identity sucks.  Be an individual, don't make it easy to be 
dismissed in a sentence.
