================= Happiness comes from the inside ==========================

I was feeling kind of depressed today. I was looking at my work at school 
and I realized that it's utter shit. I can't write for shit and my 
presentation is major crappy plus I can't do my times tables either,
I can't organize my work and as a result of this a lot of work from one 
subject is in another subjects folder because I forgot to bring the right 
book. The only thing that I enjoy is computers, but I’m only scratching
the surface of that, I can't code, I wish I could but I can't. I really 
want to know a programming language. Maybe I can take a uni degree in it.
that’s if I can even get into uni, with the Nter score I’m likely to get
I don't think I will be able to. Looks like TAFE is the way to go for me,
But that’s a load of bullshit and I won't get a good job. It all is very 
daunting.

I was lisitning to the radio, yer yer I hardly do because it's all shit
(except when they play Moby or prodigy of course) and I hear this song,
and I feel that I start to relate to it, the guy reckons he feels that 
he can't go on. I'm like yer, that’s how I feel sometimes but then I 
realise that this guy has no problem whatsoever "going on" he is a rich
bloody singer that probably has less actual personality problems than a 
rather small soap dish, and thanks to people like me listing to his song 
he has more money than he knows what to do with. And I knew that the only
reason that he writes these kind of songs is that it appeals to the 
self absorbed teenagers that feel that there is no hope in there lives, 
simply because it is fashionable to do so. I reminded myself that
I don't want to become one of them and started to feel better.

I remembered what I think that even though all those things in my life
are wrong, I don't care about them. I really don't, well maybe except 
for the coding, I know that I can find happiness from the inside. 
I have something that most people don't seem to have. It's a kind of 
happiness that can be brought on whenever I need it, I ca feel content 
with myself and i know that I don't give a crap about what other people 
think. To top it off I don't think that I did anything special to get 
it, I just kind of discovered it one day. It had always been there I just
didn't know how to work it. I think that if more people discovered this 
then the world would be a much happier place.
