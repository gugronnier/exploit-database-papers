I HATE RAP:
Since when was any old bum off the street able to sign a record deal? 
People who have absolutely NO talent can moan into microphones and make 
millions of dollars. *cough*JaRule*cough* I mean JaRule in particular. He 
has NO vocal talent whatsoever, but he gets millions of screaming fans and 
hot women. Trey Anastasio of Phish has tons of vocal talent, and MORE women. 
What does that tell you? nothing. My point is that any average loser can set 
up a drum loop and start rhyming and make tons of Money. 

Then why can't Robert Frost be a rapper? He rhymes. He makes tons on money 
already. But he can't. it's because he's not BLACK. there's the demographic 
of people that are only going to buy music if A) their friends listen to it, 
and B) the singer is someone who they could relate to. Like Aaron Carter (>.<) 
Lots of little girls like him because he's a gay little boy. But that's 
drifting from the point. The point is that the people who listen to rap are 
either people ho think they are unique because they listen to a certain type 
of music, and so many people try to become unique that it becomes not unique, 
because everyone's listening to it, and there's the people like the screaming 
kids on TRL. They listen to it almost entirely because their friends listen 
to it. It's ALL peer pressire these days. Godforbid you try to be unique. 
I was talking to someone a few weeks ago about the music they listen to. 
He just happened to be the typical black teenager who's been hypnotized by 
the media today. Why? I asked him why he doesn't try to losten to something 
new. He simply answered "because it's not mainstream, and your gay phish isn't". 

Needless to say, I got really not and bothered about this. The same "alternative 
rap" he was blapping about before was all of a sudden "mainstream" and hip and 
with it. I went on to say how people who listen to bands who you don't see on 
MTV every day always tend to be different. Gob forbid you're your own person 
and don't listen to the crap that's on MTV and most of the radio. 

About 10 minutes later, someone sitting by me who overheard the conversation 
asked what kind of music I did like, since to him it seemed like I hate 
everything that he's ever heard. and I probably do, since all he does is watch 
MTV and listen to AOL radio when he gets home to log onto his l33+ AOL (i'm 
joking, moron). Anyways, I went on to say Phish blah blah Green Day blah Tool 
blah blah RHCP blah Cake-. He stopped me. "Cake? CAKE? you mean 'I want a girl 
with a short skirt and a loong jacket', that Cake?" "Yeah", I said, "they rule". 
"They SUCK", he said. He was judging a band, and possibly an entire genre by a 
single VERSE in a song that happened to be mistakenly played on MTV. By 
mistakenly, I mean Cake was never, EVER meant to be mainstream. they're for 
a small group of prople who can appreciate John McCrea's lovely singing philosophy. 

He got into this big speech about how much they sucked compared to everything 
he's eeen on MTV and AOL radio, pretty much everything th first person said 
about how they're not mainstream and blah blah. 

Come on. fucking COME ON. Just because they're not overpublicized and accompanied 
by screaming girls doesn't make them bad. Which brings me back to my point. Rap 
has become waaay too over publicized, over capitalized, and overmoronized. 
Rap can be good of you subtract the whores, the cheap loops, and everyone who 
just walked into a studio and recorded something and then put it out in the 
stores. What networks like MTV do is say "This is what's in, This is whats 
out, this is what you spend your money on, and this is what you're supposed 
to hate". All their friends listen to what they say, so they really have no 
choice but to do what their friends do on fear of being rejected. Like it 
would be that bad if they're rejected from the big clique anyway. I've been 
my own person for my entire life, I've never bought a CD that you'd see on 
MTV (Green Day and RHCP excluded, they walk the fine line between excessive 
publicity and actually good music.) 


I have lots more to say about this, but I'm tred of typing. If you read 
this, thank you.
