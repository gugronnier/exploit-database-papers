Ok guys I don't want to like bring you all down or anything but I have
to write about this because it is a very real and a very dangerous threat
to everything that we know and care about, and people seem never to
mention it, it seems to have deserted the imaginations and the
thoughts of most people around, they just don't seem to worry about it
which is stupid because it could happen at anytime, the fact that it
hasn’t yet is a miracle and we should be thankful that we are all
still alive.

One more warning, this addendum could disturb you, it did me. but
unlike some other ones I want you to read this, I want you to think 
about it and I want you to hate the idea, because it is a horrible 
idea and something I hope for the love of nature never ever happens.

Imagine this. its a day, a normal day as far as everything goes you just
got home from work and are about to sit down for a beer or a cool drink
of coke, you switch the TV on to find everyone in a panic,

A few massive nuclear bombs have just been dropped on America.

You watch in horror as you see image after image of satellite photos
showing huge mounds of smouldering rubble where humongous cities once
stood, this makes the September 11 disasters look like a breaking of
a sandcastle, everything is flattened, nuclear winter rules.

And there is nothing you can do about it.

But your ok right? your in Australia, no bombs are going to be 
dropped here, everyone loves Australia, and you are right in one aspect
but wrong in another, yes no bombs will be dropped. but we are far from
safe, in fact I would rather have been in American when the bombs went 
off.

For now we have to wait. Wait for the radiation sickness to set in and
kill us all off one by one in horrible ways.

Panic rains in the cities, people are running looting fighting, nobody 
cares least of all the police, there is nobody to keep order, people
run in panic trying to cling onto something that they know deep down
inside they will never be able to keep or hang onto

I reckon we would have about three days of waiting before we get too
sick to move and another day before we all are gone and almost every
living thing on the planet is dead.

We would have to gather at town halls to receive the cyanide pills
and injections the government will inevitably hand out, we would collect
them and have them in our precession to use when the sickness gets too
much to bare, some people would do something they had always wanted to
experience like crash an aeroplane with them inside or jump from the top
of the rialto towers and see what it must be like to fly, some people
will live as long as they can till the radiation sickness kills them
off, because they believe they will go to hell if they commit suicide
some people will overdose on heroin and die the happiest they have 
ever been, and some people will lie together on the family bed and take
the suicide pills, injecting cyanide into the children too young to
understand what is happening.

It would effect everyone, everyone would die, from Peter Smith down the 
road to Michael Jackson. All dead.

And that really would be the end of the human race, and everything else
for that matter, and the worst thing we have total trigger happy idiots 
like Gorge W Bush sitting on the button.

The anti bomb people of the 70's had a saying that is just as relevant
today as it was then:

"One nuclear bomb can ruin your whole day"
