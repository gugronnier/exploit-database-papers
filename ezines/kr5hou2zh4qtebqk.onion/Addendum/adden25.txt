================= The Sleeping Series - Part 3 : Incubus  ==================

Nightmares. What horrible things. I have a few myself, some of them involve 
Being trapped inside a computer game that I have no control over. Some
disgusting beast will come lunging at me and I will have no way to
save myself.

Another one I have is the one where I will be suddenly jumped on by a
gang of thugs "(or get in a fight some other way) and I am unable to fight.
But it will not be from lack of trying I can tell you that. I will try
and punch them but my fists will literally just fall off the target and
I will not make the slightest dent in my attacker.

However these problems are but minor quivels to me. For the real scare is
when the sleeping demon Incubus decides to pay me a visit. And it is
he who this file is named after. the dictionary describes him as
"a male demon believed to lie on sleeping persons and to have sexual 
intercourse with sleeping women" Lovely, they make the most terrifying
thing I have ever experienced in my life sound almost 'romantic'

However I know. I know that despite all the mythology and demonology
the old dodger incubus is not a sleep god. And he is not an alien abductor,
and he is not the government taking me away in the middle of the night to do 
tests on me. He is not really that much of a "he" either, or a she for that
matter. Incubus is nothing more than a fairy tale name for the condition 
known as Sleep Paralysis.

Sleep Paralysis is a very terrifying thing. And nobody deserves to have
to go through it. 

Almost nobody I talk to knows what it is I’m saying when I mention this
situation. However I could bet that a lot of people reading this would
have experienced something like this during their life. I hope some of 
what I tell you will ring true for a few of you.

It's hard to explain what it is, you really would do better to experience 
it for yourself but I wouldn't want to wish it on you my beloved readers.

Try to imagine if you will that you have just got off to sleep from a
perticully stressful day. You were so happy to finally get into bed,
to be able to sleep and you dropped into sleep the second your head
touched the pillow and you are in the very early stages of sleep.

Then you wake up. But as if that is not bad enough you are not alone
there is somebody in the room with you, it’s a dark presence and you
just know he is there. Sometimes you can here him breathing some times
you can just literally 'feel' him.

You try to move, to look and see this intruder, but you cannot. You are
paralyzed you have been forced into a full conscious state but inside a 
sleeping body, you feel that your body is responding to your commands 
however it is not. You try and move your limbs but all you get is phantom
movements, you see your limb move and you are 100% sure that it has moved
but you then try and feel them only to discover that they are still
paralyzed, you have no way of knowing what is happening to your body 
and if that wasn't enough your intruder is moving closer towards you
enveloping you in his blackness.

And then he does something to you, I am not female so he has never
raped me so to speak but he just pushes down on me with all his force,
or he will just simply sit on me. and look at me, although I have never
seen a face on him I just know that he is looking at me, gloating at
me. As if he knows all my mistakes and he can somehow laugh about it
to himself.

This will usually last about two minuets before I wake up for real
and I am back in my room. I am happy to be out of there however I
am soaked in sweat and I am scared shitless.

After a few minutes I calm down and go back to sleep.

I get this probably about once or twice a year. and I can tell you
it's not good when it does happen.

Well that’s it for "The Sleeping Series" Part three was the last part
and rest assured we will be returning you to your normal programming
for addendum next issue.

The origins of this file started off as a long file about narcolepsy
that I was paranoid that I had for a little while. However after
I discovered that I did not have this I split the file up into three
issues and gave them fancy names.

However saying that I do want to make clear that these last three
files have changed dramatically from their original beginnings, entire lines
and paragraphs have been ripped out and a lot of it has been re-written
with better and, in my opinion more interesting content.

I hope that you have enjoyed these three issues and we will be back
next issue with more literal junk
