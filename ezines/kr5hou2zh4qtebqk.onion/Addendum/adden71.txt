Walk over to the table, Turn on kettle. Switch off kettle, 
fill with water, turn on kettle, wait, put coffee in cup, 
put sugar in cup, burn hand on kettle, pour water into cup,
burn hand on water, pour milk in cup, discover milk is
a little off, and that the spoon is sticky from the last 
time I made coffee, the coffee sticks to the spoon, and so 
does the sugar, get coffee in the sugar pot, drink coffee, 
feel ill, burn lip.

I'm not worried at all.

Find file, download file, wait 3 hours for download open 
download, download corrupt, find download again, re-download,
file still corrupt, find file somewhere else, download nowhere 
to be found, download from original site, download corrupt,
burn lip on coffee

I'm not worried at all.

10:30pm, Wednesday, turn TV on, set up video player all ready 
to go, tennis, no matter, be on soon, get biscuits, new fresh 
coffee, blanket, all ready. 11:30pm, channel nine regrets to 
inform me that ‘Enterprise’ will not be shown tonight to make 
way for the grand-slam-super-duper-we-really-do-show-alot-of-
this-just-to-piss-you-off-doesn't-matter-it's-all-the-same-
anyway-tennis-tournament. Watch shulutionazwalia vs. 
jyhumdigadonovitch for a few minuets, realise that I can go
to my bathroom and puke up things more interesting.

I'm not worried at all.

Open bag, read journal, realise that I have millions and 
millions of pages of homework to do, all due for tomorrow, 
get angry and stressed. Calm down, open bag again, find I 
forgot homework book, get angry, don't calm down

I'm not worried at all.

Sit down to watch movie, place DVD in tray close tray, start
watching movie, movie freezes, get angry, windows cannot
end real magic play control, restart computer, high mem is
testing extended memory.....done, load again, try again,
still freezes on same point, fast forward past point,
choppy play back, computer seizing up, ctrl+alt+delete,
end program, end program, end program, end program, end
process, end process, would I like to report this error to 
Microsoft? I think they have it already, 2000 time's already..

I'm not worried at all.

Get on old 486 to try and calm my tethered nerves, decided to
install a nice stable copy of windows 3.11, to remind me of
days gone by ehen stable easy to use OS's were the normal thing
to see. Format old computer, install dos 6.22, fine, install 
windows 3.11 disk 1 fine, 2 fine, 3 fine, 4 fine, 5 fine, 6 
fine, 7 fine, 8 fine, 9 corrupt setup cannot continue.

brake old computer

and disks

I'm not worried at all.

The moral of the story, don't be like me, don't worry
