I'm so fucking freezing
it is not for me, pleasing

my butt feels like ice
I wish it felt warm and nice

As I sit here in my chair
I can feel the standingnss of my hair

and I wonder how to describe
the extreme cold, in my hide

I wish I was warm, no more of this doom
all hugged up in a duvet, warm in my room.

but I'm not, I’m cold, and I will be for hours
until I get back to the warm, lovely houses

I want my bed, all large and inviting
it's strange yes it is, it seems almost exciting

I'm still cold.

Well that’s my cold poem, I wrote that while sitting in a very cold computer
room at my school, on the 30th of April 2002. Now I know that it should be
spring then and getting hotter, but with these back-to-front seasons they 
have here in Australia its autumn and its getting colder, its a sure sign 
that winters on it's way, and its not going to stop for no man.

It's another sure fire sign that I have to get my Winter clothes out of
retirement and back into active service, which includes my ex-NATO combat 
jacket, My gloves, my hat and my warm slippers. And I am going to have to 
find out what happened to my hood for my jacket.

But saying that, I must say that I love winter, I really do. I love to be
able to do my winter routine. Say after I have been walking in the pouring
rain, the hailing sleet and the blistering cold it's nice to open my doors
to the lovely heat and warmth that is my room. to be able to get in and turn 
on the lights, turn on the heater and stand by it for a second and warm up 
there

Then when I’m pretty warm I open the curtain and go and sit down in my comfy 
chair and make my self a cup of coffee, from there I can watch the rain pour 
down the window from the relative safety and warmth of my room, feeling the
warm nectar of the drink fall down my thought keeping me warm. I don't know 
their is something really nice about it. 

Being warm inside, when everything outside is wet, windy and wild. I really
don't know what it is. It's just nice.

But my room needs to be tidy for it to make the right effect, I cannot have
it messy, because it needs to be inviting and if there is shit everywhere
then it seems very cold and unfriendly. But I try to combat this as best 
as possible by keeping it as tidy as possible.

There are other methods I use to make my personal space more inviting
when choosing thins to put in my room I try and use nice warm colors 
like browns and oranges, they make me feel warm even if I am not. I also
always have duvet on hand and a pillow so if I am to cold I can always lie 
on the couth and watch a movie all nice and warm.

Lighting also makes a difference, I don't use fluorescent lights but real 
bulbs and I will always choose warm hues when I choose the colour of my
bulbs. That way even the lights are warm.

And then when I finally get into bed for the night and I can hear the hail 
on the roof I always feel cold in my duvet because I have a summer one and 
I am to poor to afford a winter one so I chuck my other duvet from the couch
on top and sleep with two of them, sometimes I get too warm, and have to
take it off.

Whoever said that winter was a bad thing, it really inspires that nesting
spirit, maybe my strain of apes decided to hibernate during the winter.

I think underneath what I am on the outside I can really be quite 
strange.
