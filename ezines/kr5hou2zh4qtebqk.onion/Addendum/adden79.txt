Issue# 79 : Doom III hopes and dreams

ID software have been buzzing around recently with their promise of the 
latest episode in the doom saga. Namely doom III.

I'm not to sure how i feel about this. I have not really ever been a fan 
of Id software after the original dooms. Doom was good for the time Doom 
II was definitely better. I played quake, enjoyed the shareware version 
immensely, bought the full version and lost interest. I much preferred 
Duke Nukem 3d, because of the rich colours and the interactive familiar 
environments. I played QuakeII and still preferred Duke Nukem 3d. And to 
top it all off I preferred half life, with it's rich interactive story 
line and funny scenes over quake III. Which was just out-and-out action. 
And if I did want just action, for some reason unreal tournament and 
counter strike appealed to me a lot more than quake III ever did.

So i really don't know how i am going to react to a new high polygon 
doom.

Id softwares games where always too dark and dingy for me. If you ask 
me i found castle after castle to boring when it came to quake. Even 
when they tired to make space stations or moon outposts they all seemed 
to be made out of rock and wood with draw bridges. I found it all just 
a little tedious. Which you can't really blame me for. 

It also seemed to me that Id software, particularly with the quake games 
only knew how to use grey and brown textures for some reason. Duke 
Nukem, Half Life and UT where all very much more rich and colourful 
games, with varying locations and breathtaking senary. Even though, in 
gameplay UT was much the same as Q3 I somehow preferred the characters 
and the playability in UT.

So even with all the hype surrounding doom, i still wait for Duke Nukem 
Forever (after five years no less) much more than i do for doom3.

When doom was first released back in 1993 or whenever it was, it was 
revolutionary, it was like "you mean we can actually see what the guy 
holding the shotgun would see?" back in the old days that was something 
revolutionary. Nowadays, we complain if the shotgun doesn’t have three 
different versions and a secondary fire to boot.

We have come to expect so much more from our first person shooter 
games, the novelty of being a homicidal manic with a plasma rifle 
has worn off, "what was that? we were meant to be saving the world? 
ahh yes, that’s right" Make that a world saving hero, with a plasma 
rifle"

What i am saying is that ID better not release 'just' a remake of 
the original doom, we don't just want mindless violence. (well i 
don't) We need a story line, a plot something to keep us going through 
it. And maybe, if it's not too much trouble, a little colour about the 
place.

Not just, walk in, see zombie, shoot zombie, get key card, open door, 
new zombie, shoot zombie etc. That’s old. I want to walk into a room, 
see the wall crumble in and a zombie fall from it, chewing on its still 
screaming prey, see me and advance towards me,  then a many tentacled 
beast leaping through the wall and start fighting with the original 
zombie. Just as I open fire with my chain gun.

One last thing, I want too see old friends, I want to see imps, done 
in new polygons, i want to see the barons of hell and the cyber demons. 
I don't want to see "Cyber Imps 2002" bogified versions of these cute 
little demons, I want to see the original imps, just in polygons.

And if it's not to much trouble I'd like to see the BFG 9000 and the 
plasma gun. I hope they all get a mention in their somewhere

Well I hope it turns out to be a good game. But one things for sure, 
Duke Nukem Forever will wipe the floor with everything currently 
available.
