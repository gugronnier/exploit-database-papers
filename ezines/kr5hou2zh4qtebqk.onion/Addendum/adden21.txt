 Author : Steak, 20 issues and I'm out.
============================== RIP Addendum ================================

Well that’s it
I never even thought I would get around to writing this issue
I was sure that I would give this up before I let it get this far

Let me explain
When I first started writing addendum it was a silly little idea
that I had to try and get the masses to understand my way of thinking,
to say to themselves "sas that hoopy frood, steak he's a man who really
knows where his towel is"

I started writing issues like mad, most times realizing issues
everyday, sometimes I would even release 2 or 3 issues a day.

Then one day my great friend phoenix came by and asked if he could
write a few issues, well he did and they found their place in there
all nice and well.

People even went as far to describe phoenix and myself with any number
of compliments including but not limited to:

* Gun
* Hoopy Frood
* Cool Guys
* I really like the zine, who’s steak?
* great, can I have my free donuts now
* hey you f**king Bast**ds get a real f**king publishing job and stop 
  f**king complaining

Around this time I also decided that I would publish only 20 issues of the m
most  ultra-cool ultra-sound e-zine ever to come out of the great publishing 
house’s of 3-yandra. Then let them float around the internet for the rest 
of eternity, come back 3 years later and see if I still could find them.
But most importantly after issue 20, stop doing it all together.

And as I was sending out the last issue (issue 20) I realized that I
had just achieved my original goal.

So I was left with two choices, do I carry on with something that I
have been having fun with and something that people enjoy and get
happy over and totally abandon all morals?

Or do I stick to my guns and adhere to what I originally had in mind
and go down with at least some sense of dignity?

Well I really have never been one for making people happy, and I really
love morals.

So with that in mind I have to sadly say that this is the last issue of
addendum you will ever read (except, of course if you are reading a 
back-issue)

It has been a real fun couple of months and I want to thank all who like to 
read it and especially all who have subscribed to it.

I really hope that it has in some way enriched your lives, it definitely has
made me feel a whole lot better about the world

Rest assured that if you subscribed we will keep your email address on file
and if we do anything like this again, we will email you and find out if you
are still interested in recieveing it.

If you don't want us keeping your address then please mail 
steak@optushome.com.au and tell me.

Please do not write me an email and ask me to start up again. Addendum is dead
in the water. Except it and move on

If you wish to find a new ezine to subscribe to, many good ezines can be found
at http://www.etext.org

So long and thanks for all the fish.


This is Steak sigining out.
