1. Introduction

Addendum: (say a-DEN-dum) noun. Plural is addenda. Anything added, such as 
an appendix, to a book

You should feel lucky, quite a few people who are in my 
life do not get to read this, its only for people who i don't know and for 
people who won't take it all the wrong way.

I'm not going to make any guaranties that these will be spelled correctly,
or have proper grammar or that they will have the right words in them, ie 
orgasm instead or organism. I'll run a spell checker through them before 
i send them out and read through them once to make sure they make sense 
but that’s about it.

To be entirely truthful I can't even say that what I write will be 
interesting or fun, just that it will be the truth to the best of my 
Knowledge

If you wish (for some reason) to receive a copy of this via email whenever 
i write it then send an email to steak@optushome.com.au saying just that. 
There is no automation in this system so i will have to reply to each request
and send out each issue by hand. So please be patient when waiting for your 
reply It could take two seconds and it could take two weeks, though I doubt 
it. Most replies are sent out before the end of the week. You will receive
the latest issue and keep on sending you issues until you ask me to stop or 
i get bored of it and stop doing it.


2. Channel Ten and how it is becoming nothing more than a vessel for 
advertising.

Channel Ten, the main free-to-air channel here in Australia, is becoming 
nothing more than a vessel for advertising.  

Let me compare it here to an English TV station, I used to watch I won't 
compare it to BBC1 and BBC2, (British Broadcasting Cooperation) that 
incidentally deliver top of the range programs like neighbors, star trek, 
red dwarf, young ones, black adder, Seinfeld, bottom etc etc with NO 
Advertising let me just say that again NO Advertising whatsoever. Because 
it would just be unfair to compare it with a station that has no advertising. 
I am going to compare it with ITV and Channel 4 the channels that do have 
advertising. On these channels during a average "Frasier" episode you would 
have only 1 brake in the middle and that's it. 

Here in Australia You would have four breaks, a "this program is brought to 
you by [insert greedy company here]" on both ends of the show and adverts 
scrolling happily along the bottom of the screen for other programs that 
you have no interest in whatsoever. I have to be fair though, it's not just 
channel; ten that does this. Its Nine and Seven as well and even SBS to 
some extent. I find my self watching ABC even though usually nothing good 
is on just for the pleasure of watching something without breaks. This is 
really getting out of hand. Even though this plea will fall on deaf ears,
i feel i must write this to show that i do not agree with it.

3. What we laughably call the News

The news is so much bullshit. Why would anyone want to watch it? its like a 
animated version of the tabloids, spreading roomer and hysteria,  it is totally 
over sensationalized, just for higher ratings watching it is like watching a 
cheap ass drama with little or no plot. 

To add on top of that it is totally biased as well, for instance a little while 
ago they got hold of some training videos that the US had released (had to go 
through "special" channels no doubt to make sure it showed Osama Binladan in 
the worst light possible) the headline was "Chilling training videos from the 
Osama training camps" That got me going, chilling hey? firstly it is all only 
released to make them look as evil and bad as possible and secondly they should
have a look at the US training videos and see how "Chilling" they are. 
Interesting fact; the US navy seals are trained to slit a neck in such a way 
that they start at one ear and do not stop cutting until the other ear has been 
reached. How chilling is that, but that's ok of course because they are 
protecting us from the dangerous terrorists. It doesn't matter that the US brought 
this all on themselves....

But I'm getting off track. Another thing about the news is that if you watched 
it you could be forgiven for thinking that the only interesting things happen 
here in Australia and that the rest of the world does not have anything 
interesting happening in it. The only time they show anything from any other 
part of the world is when something so big happens that you cannot ignore it,
like the September 11th disaster. other than that its all mostly local news.

That's it, until next time so long.
