It had been a long day, I had been trudging through our fair city in the hot dreary
sun all day, I was really hot, hot and sweaty, the sort of sweaty where you can start
to see huge wet patch’s under you armpits. In short I wasn’t really comfortable.

I had the disk, it was perfect, a wonderful little slip of plastic just the right
size to fit into my floppy disk tray. On the disk was my latest article for
angstmonster, (the zine a friend of mine, Gir runs) but I wasn’t one hundred percent
happy with it, I really wanted to talk to him about it, iron out any problems, cross
all the t’s and dot all the....lower case j’s. But alas I realised that I couldn’t
communicate with my friend because of a distinct lack of message boards to do with he
text scene.

Then I kicked myself in the head because I realised that in my haste to condemn
myself for not having a message board I had forgotten that I had created one the very
same night before just for this purpose. I fired up my internet browser, and dragged
the mouse pointer up to the ‘address bar’ in it I typed:

http://steak.proboards4.com/.

And instantly a suitable message board popped up, how cool is that?

Feel free to use this new message board to discuss the general text scene or pretty
much anything else that crosses your mind, at least until textscene.com puts up
something better.

Until next time.....
