Issue# 45 : A world to live in
8th May 2002
Author: Steak
========================================================================
So what kind of world would I like to live in? What kind of world would
I love if I didn't have to worry about other peoples feelings and
problems and my future, and if living in this world could advance me to 
the stage I want to be at in my life, without the need to get a piece of 
paper to say that I pretended to know some things for a few years of my 
life?

Well for a start I would want only sane people in my world that could
hold intelligent conversations and could contribute to my well being, 
no sports jocks that continually postpone interesting things to watch
with their live TV advertised, franchised, sports coverage, no 
no-brainers that insist on doing nothing more in this world other than 
just sitting on their arse and waiting for somebody to come along who
is not like them so they can beat them up, no anti star trek people so
i can finally enjoy my television show in piece and I can be stop
being bugged by star wars facts, no religious extremists / fundamentalists
so they can stop hurting other people that don't believe in the same 
things as them and are actually enjoying their life and also so they 
can stop bugging me with their propaganda.

No school, just libraries where I can go day after say and learn what
I want to learn at the speed I am most comfortable with and with no 
deadlines, tests and exams on what I know and also so I can spend 
hours and hours reading the books that I never get time to read
because I am to busy doing what somebody else told me to do.

Lots of naturalistic things like trees and fish and cats and other
nice looking animals so I can take long walks in the park and enjoy
some of natures most vivid creations, most importantly, no bloody
mosquitoes

no bloody cars so I don't have to own one to get around and don't have
to pay tax and don't pollute that atmosphere with my movements, and
so they don't give me a headache and so I can enjoy life without
the constant loud noises associated with it.

lots of music, speakers cunningly concealed in rocks and fake, real
looking trees so I can take long walks with gentle music playing in 
the background, totally at peace with myself.

places where I can go to just be with myself and my thoughts so I can
have long detailed concepts and ideas, write them down and publish
loads of addendums with out the distractions of school and work to tie
me down to anything.

Rooms upon rooms with computers that are constantly updated with the
latest technology each with its own individual T3 line to the outside
world so I can surf the web to my hearts content not having to worry
about download limits or hard drive space

Nice little bridges over serene little streams where I can go with my
girlfriend and spend many a time having discussions on the state of 
our own little perfect world.

But alas I will never get these things; the world does not want me to
be happy, it just wants me to be hateful and sad. the world wants to 
be full of stupid annoying people who seem to be just there to infuriate 
me and ask me silly questions.

Sometimes I just wish it would all just go away.
