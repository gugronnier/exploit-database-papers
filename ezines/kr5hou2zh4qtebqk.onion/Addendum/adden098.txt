	 The Fly, By Steak
 	¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
At twelve o’clock noon today a strange thing happened to say the
least, the sun became eclipsed by the moon. This although rare,
wouldn’t have been so strange was it not for one little thing -it was
completely unscheduled. The eclipse plunged the world into darkness
and turned the day into night.

Straight after that little surprise another strange thing happened;
the stars started falling from the sky. Small points that up until
this morning I had been sure were gas giants hundreds of thousands of
light years away started falling. Because of this the night has been
turned from a fairly normal kind of light for nighttime into almost
total pitch black.

It’s no secret that the world is in darkness tonight.

It seems that the most unthinkable thing has happened, judgment day is
upon us, and there is nothing we can do as a human race to stop it.

As you can imagine I’m pretty upset about this but I realize that the
inevitable can’t be stopped and hence I’m trying to make the best of
it, like I always do. So in this wisdom I have decided to take a walk
around my town.

As you can imagine, panic has broken out, and the fact that there is
hardly any light whatsoever doesn’t help matters in the slightest.
People are running, cars are speeding, where they think they are all
going I will never know but right now it really doesn’t seem all that
important.

I am walking down a street I used to know quite well a few weeks ago
and suddenly I hear a noise. The noise makes me jump despite the fact
that it’s one I’m instantly familiar with; it’s just a pay phone
ringing. I calm down somewhat.

Not really having anything else to do I decide to pick it up, I will
transcribe the details of the conversation here.

[Me] Hello -Your fucked
[Caller] Do you always answer the phone like that?

[Me] No not on normal days, but you see today is judgment day, so
unless your soul is completely clean (which I very much doubt) then
you’re going to spend the rest of eternity in hell
[Caller] What’s to say I’m not already there?

[Me] Well the fact that you’re not screaming in pain for one thing
[Caller] What’s to say that I find hell unpleasant? What if I happen
to like it here?

[Me] Don’t be stupid; no human being can like hell.
[Caller] What’s to say I’m human?

[Me] What are you then?
[Caller] It’s unimportant. What is important is the message that I
have for you, a message that you may wish to listen to you, I have to
show you some truths, some things that have been kept secret in the
past, but today can be reveled

[Me] I’m all ears
[Caller] Your friends aren’t really your friends are they?

[Me] huh? What? Of course they are my friends, I spend time with them
and have fun with them, hence they are my friends.
[Caller] I don’t think so, are they really your friends or are they
just letting you help them out?

[Me] Well I suppose that you can look at it like that
[Caller] Yes you can can’t you? And all those secrets that you have
trusted your so-called friends with, I’m telling you right now; they
have all been let out to other parties. You know they say that a
secret is something that you tell one other person.

[Me] They say that do they? Look, never mind, I know your wrong. My
friends have told me faithfully that everything I have told them in
confidence has not been divulged to another living soul. I don’t tell
other people their secrets and they don’t tell people mine
[Caller] I know your lying, you know your lying and I know you don’t
believe me when I tell you I come from hell but I don’t care, that’s
how most of the world is, that’s another truth you have to open your
mind up to.

[Me] My mind is opened up enough already, I don’t need you to tell me
all this extra crap, how do I know your not some drunk looser
depressed at the prospect of waiting until the end of the world, just
dialing in random numbers into a phone and harassing people?
[Caller] Why the fuck would I lie to you? What’s the point? Why would
I even bother using a phone? I’m telling you, child, tonight you’re
going to fall, like a fly from a wall.

[Me] Screw you man, don’t you have better things to do than to harass
poor innocent people like myself? Don’t you have a conscience or
anything?
[Caller] You should know better than anyone that a conscience is a
pest, I got rid of mine years ago, it just got in the way when I had
important duties to fulfill. It was my ambition to complete my duties,
but I was too wrapped up in those ambitions. It was ultimately those
same ambitions that led me to failure; it’s the same in your world. It
always has been that way and you know it always will be.

[Me] I don’t know about that, I’ve always been pretty good with my
writing; my ambition has never got in the way of my success there.
[Caller] That’s crap and you know it is, your artistic ‘talent’ is
useless even in your own world, let alone in mine, a place you will
come to inhabit very soon if I know my timelines well enough. Your art
is pointless and futile; everything has been done before, only better.
Each artist is a cannibal, chopping up others work to create his own
paintings. Every poet is a thief, reading others work, writing his own
while incorporating aspects of the original artist’s work, which was
in turn plagiarized from someone else’s words. All of them send their
inspiration to the grave and then sing about how they have none left.

[Me] You seem to have some insight; but how is this all going to help
me? I’m going to experience the same fate as every other slightly
sinful person on this planet.
[Caller] Oh it won’t help, it’s far to late for you, I just thought
you might like to know, seeing that it’s no secret any more. Look I’ve
gotta go, yeah? I’m running out of change.

[Me] But wait, can’t you help me? When will I be judged? What can I
do? I didn’t mean to live my life the way I have, but I can’t do
anything about it now can I? If I had another chance there would be so
much I would do differently, so much I’d rearrange...
[Caller] Sorry kid, no more second chances, you’ve already been
judged, there’s nothing I can do, I can’t even talk to you for much
longer seeing as I used the last of my...beep

The line cut out and the speaker beeped, signaling that the mysterious
caller had run out of money. I sighed, hung up the phone and turned to
face my ultimate fate. As sure as I was born - I will die, and as sure
as I have risen - I will fall.

Fall, like a fly from the wall.
