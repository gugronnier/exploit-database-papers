Issue# 68 : Life would be dull without me

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

This was a rather interesting argument that I had with a very intent 
Eminem fan on the winamp forums, I had quite a bit of fun and I think
that what I wrote is worth something, even just to show my feelings on
old Mr. Mathers

Yo Slim's new album ain't got that copy protect sh*t on it cause i bought 
it on monday and it went on my computer no problem. 

I hate  the arses that copy or download eminem's album because i think he's 
the only music artist that deserves every penny for his music but as for 
all the pop lovers download music as much as you can try not to pay for 
it as cardboard cut out stars dont deserve sh*t. 

yo if u ain't bought Eminem's album yet u gotta get it...there ain't 1 
song on it that is sh*t...but u gotta expect that from Eminem now so 
far he hasn't released a album that sucks. 

-Vince  

P.S. i got it on monday cause it came out in the UK on monday

Well the old Eminem argument, just had to stick in my 2c 

Personally I can’t see what the big deal is with him, in my view he’s 
just a guy that’s trying to get his records sold to adolescent teenagers 
that are trying to rebel against something that they can’t find. 

You can tell this by the forums over at eminem.com one Moby forumer said 
that “the shit of the internet go over there to take a dump” and I 
couldn’t agree more, go and take a look at the quality of posts there 
compared to the ones here at winamp.com (that is if you can bare to get
passed all the forced “looped beats”  ) 

And I wouldn’t classify his sounds as music; real music comes from the 
greats like Beethoven, Mozart and Rossini, to the (relatively) modern 
greats like Bob Dylan, Eric Clapton, Moby, Sting and the Police. That 
music sounds nice, is easy to listen to, is un-offensive, can be beautiful 
and can inspire all the best feelings in someone, music is supposed 
to sooth the savage beast, not enrage it. 

And I don’t care if some little whining teenager decides that he is 
going to try and rebel against me and tell me to stick my Beethoven 
where the sun don’t shine, or put's  's next to thier names, because 
I know that you need some intelligence to appreciate music like that, 
and no little brat is going to change my mind on that issue. 

To quote Phisherman in a really old topic on the winamp forums “any 
average loser can set up a drum loop and start rhyming and make tons 
of Money.” And it’s true, anyone can swear into a microphone as well, 
hell I could do it and get a lot of people pissed off but I don’t want 
to, I would prefer to express myself in more mature and constructive 
ways, if we don’t do this society will fall in around us. Yo. 

And it is true, Eminem’s sounds aren’t really pop, it doesn’t have that 
whiney ultra-sonic sound to it (well in some of it, it does but in most, 
not) it’s just made the same way, i.e. synthesised manufactured backing 
beats and a song that the leading ‘artist’ didn’t write. 

I guess it all comes down to taste in the end, but if I want to hear 
crap I’ll turn the volume up on my toilet

kinda agree apart from the rebel part...teenagers aren't tryin to rebel, 
teenagers are tryin to see how fast they can get drunk or how many times 
they can get there hole, we ain't tryin to rebel against anything aight...
that was the 60's the decade ure stuck in or 80's can't decide 


aight i thought that dude before was takin the piss but it seems the music 
world will crumble if ppl start listening to music that was made before my 
fuckin gran was born (Beethoven) but no i ain't gonna tell ya where ta 
shove it but the thought is there :P and yea sure anyone can swear into 
a microphone but not that many ppl can make it sound good and who would 
wanna listenin to you

First, I am a teenager i am seventeen years old i just try not to be 
assosiated with the no-brain kind of people that seem to frequent at 
my school, i try to make what i write make sence, i try to do well at 
my studies and i try not to rebel against something that isn't there. 
And i know that teenagers are trying to rebel, they do it all the time 
i watch them with disgust as the take the piss out of the teacher for 
teaching by making multiple farmyard animal noises in class while she 
is trying her hardest to give them a chance in life, this doesn't 
seem right to me. 

And it sickens me to the stomach. They rebel by "tryin to see how fast 
they can get drunk or how many times they can get there hole" for this 
reason i do not drink and i do not smoke, (getting my hole tho....
thats another story ;) ) i find it below me. Alcohol is for older people 
who can take the time to apprechieate a good wine with a nice year and 
for a nice tasting drink, not just to get a buzz off and to look 
cool, even though you don't (when our drunk that is...) 

But most importantley i try to like music based on how I feel about 
it not what my friends feel, that means that i will listen to any 
kind of music that sounds good, i listen to beethoven, mozart, hewy 
lewis and the news, bob dylan and pink floyed from god knows when, 
to up-to-the-minuet-bands like moby, nine inch nails, and the 
prodigy. So i wouldn't say i was stuck in the eightys or the sixteys. 

And at one point eminem was just like every other teenager out there, 
a pissed off little white boy who thought he was being unfairly treated 
and wanted to rebel, he just recordered his shouting, and some of it 
ryhmed. People seem to forget this and make him into something he is not. 

Besides, he's so fake.

...seems most ppl in this forum are over 40 or gay 

Great Software shit forum 

and btw i only started this thread to say how great Eminem's ablum was i 
didn't ask for faggit reply's from ppl over 40
-----------------------------------------------------------------------



Well i'm not over forty, so that must make me a "faggit" (spelling nicked 
from quoted text) i can tell you i am not gay, i don't believe that there 
is anything wrong with being gay, i see no problems with it and i try to 
treat all people with the respect they deserve and i don't base my o
pinions of people based on thier sexuality. I't just not what i feel i 
want to do. 

However you wern't trying to make a note about my sexuality, you were 
trying to offend me, so i take offence. Calling names like "gay" and 
"faggot" are such imiture little things that little boys do, (like 
the people who listen to eminem) 

Kolbeinn had it right when he said that "it is rooted in the desire to 
outwardly express homophobia" and he is deaed right, the thing that only 
you can no however is it can also mean the classic "closet case" 
homosexual....you can never tell.

Thanks phisherman, it's nice to get some positive feedback from a 
moderator, seeing as I am just a lonely junior member, though I have been 
here for a while, just never really posted, guess I just couldn't stay 
away from a good Eminem argument. 

Though now that I look over what I wrote, some of it doesn't make that 
much sense, which kind of contradicts what I actually said, for that 
I am sorry, mental note to self: proof read  

And as for Elementaluk Come on, aren’t you going to reply to my post? 
I spent all that time writing to you, which could have been spent 
writing t-files, for you just to ignore me and try and piss off zootm 
instead....some people.

What’s the matter Elementaluk?, did somebody write something that you 
couldn't argue against? Maybe it would just be easier for you if 
somebody in charge took pity on you and closed the thread? Then you 
would not be able to respond.... 

Maybe...

umm...no i said is someone gonna close this thread cause its STUPID! 
and yall are all up on homosexuality a little more than me and you's 
seem to be more homophobic than me. 

and if i could be bothered reading the other posts i still doubt I 
would reply to em. 

if u like gays good 4 u... 

I speak a LITTLE like i'm from the hood cause of people on the internet 
i've just picked it up over the past year and i listen to alot of rap
 music (Wu Tang, MOP, Ludacris, Jay-Z, Eminem, Dr-Dre, Snoop, Royce Da 5"9)


[steak]


This thread is getting boring, that’s right. 

So in (my) closing I wish to say a few things 

1. I am no homophobic, nothing I have said even suggests that, don't even 
bother wasting the energy to type a argument against that. Period. 

2. If you can't be bothered to read other threads how do you expect to 
argue against them 

4. I don't care how much you talk like you are "in the hood" weather 
it’s a little or a lot, I just suggest you use proper English in 
future if you want people to understand/respect you. 

I am going now.
