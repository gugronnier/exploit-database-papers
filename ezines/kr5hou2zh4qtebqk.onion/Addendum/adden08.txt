=================== Yourself family and friends ============================

Let me ask you a question

Who do you REALLY care about?

Who would you sacrifice yourself for rather than sentencing them to die?

Somebody once told me what he thought the answer to this question was and 
it is something that has stayed with me for quite a while. And I believe it
to be true for most people in the world. the only people in the world that 
he truly cared about were:

Himself
Family
Friends

And I think that that is true for me as well, just so you know Kim, my 
girlfriend fits under two of these categories, and maybe even all of them

I know that there are thousands of people being meanly slaughtered 
I know that there are millions of people starving of hunger
I know that there are loads of people who are being torched at this second

But I can honestly say that I am not really losing much sleep over these
poor souls and I don't think that you do either, tell me how many times 
have you stayed up feeling for these people? Not many times I should think.

When it comes down to it all people care about is themselves family and 
friends, sometimes even less.

Is this bad? do we really have enough time to spare a thought about these
people in our busy lives, do our 'busy' lives and all the so called problems 
that we spend copies amounts of cash on psychiatrists for really have any 
significance in comparison to these peoples lives and problems?

I think so

I think that the only thing that matters is the immediate world around you,
many people think about the people who are worse off, many people try to 
help, some people with lots of money go as far as to donate to charities that
help people like this, other people who have a lot of free time on there 
hands set up charities to help people like this and urge people to give them 
money and then spend all the money on advertising to urge more people to 
give them more money, by making you feel bad if you don't.

I mean I have enough problems without somebody else laying there’s on top of 
me. And this is what charities who want more money pray on. That feeling. They 
show you pictures of a thin kid in some far out east country dieing of 
starvation and make you feel bad because you are enjoying your life and not
donating money to him or her. But the sad truth of the matter is that you are 
really only spending money on is yourself, it makes you feel good to donate 
to these people, it makes you think you are making a difference, simply 
because they told you so. You cannot help them. do you think they will really 
miss that five bucks you were going to send to them but didn't and bought a 
copy of TV week with instead?

Maybe it’s a bad idea to worry about other people maybe as a result I will just 
feel that my problems are nothing compared to there’s, and I will feel someway 
insuperior and I wont find it as easy to feel sorry for myself, which is something 
I need to do to stop myself going insane all them time.

Maybe I really don't care,

am I a horrible person, I don't think so

I am not better or worse in this respect than anyone else am I?

food for thought.
