======================= Coffee, rats and monkeys ===========================
I'm sitting in phoenix's living room. Typing on a Pentium 90 in dos mode,
on edit with no word rap drinking copies amounts of coffees, with old plates
of food littering the floor that phoenix refuses to clean up and rats running
wild along the floor. On top of that the fucking space bar only some times
works causing me to go back along my typing to change "goback" to "go back"
every now and again.

And sitting here I realize that I cannot see myself as anything other than a
human. I want to so much, I am not ashamed to tell you that I sometimes sit
at home naked looking at myself in the mirror and wanting to see just
another species of ape but all I see is a human.

I feel that I am in no way different from an ape, and that i should be able
to recognize myself as such but I have tremendous difficulty doing so. I look
and all I can see is (relative) sophistication and (somewhat) intelligence
and I want to see a wild animal.

Maybe it is because of conditioning, I have always thought of myself as
human and it is hard to shake off the feeling and see myself as anything
else.

If i could see myself as a ape then perhaps I would be at piece with myself
and i would not need to show my feelings to the world in the form of an
ezine.

Tired, coffee, swig, drink, swallow, write

Anyway enough of me
