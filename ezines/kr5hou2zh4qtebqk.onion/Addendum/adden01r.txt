===================== The End: Revised =====================================

Welcome to Addendum.

Addendum: (say a-DEN-dum) noun. Plural is addenda. Anything added, such as 
an appendix, to a book

This zine is an addendum to life.

Well here you are reading this file, keep going, you may like what you
find, if you don't well tough titties, its what we wrote so it won't
change for you, of all people.

What does the 'revised' stand for under issue? well this is the revised 
edition of issue 1, the 40th anniversary edition if you will, with the 
special features, with the directors commentary, deleted scenes, 
outtakes and a behind the scenes documentary.

Well I was lying about all the features, as issues go this is a pretty 
boring one, I suggest you read another issue, but if you want an 
introduction to addendum then this is the best you are going to get, 
its not much but it's something

my real reason for re-writing the first issue is this, when I go over what 
Phoenix and I have written I get ashamed sometimes, I will be the first one 
to admit it, there are some real crap addendum’s out there on the index page 
especially some of the old original ones. 

Badly written, subjects not being properly discussed, and the very 
first one is a right shocker, I really do hate it and wish I had done 
something better,

so I have decided to redo issue one, as a revised edition, how i wished 
i could have done it, this is in essence what I am doing right now.

Most of this will be reused for the introduction for the addendum book 
i am printing.

Who am I?
I am steak, my real name is James Keen I am the founder and starter of 
addendum, I write issues of addendum and listen to music mostly, I 
don’t have much of a life but that doesn’t seem to bother me that 
much, I do have a girlfriend though who I love very much, which is 
more than most losers can say for themselves

I may be mentally unstable, I don't know, i certainly feel different from
other people, maybe that's a characteristic, alas more stuff I don't
know, I certainly am plagued by many sleep disorders (read issue twenty 
three through twenty five to find out about them) But in the end I will 
have leave it up to you to judge my sanity through my writings as
we can only really be judged by and outside unbiased opinion.

I like watching animals, especially cats, or more precisely my cat there 
is certain beauty to natures most prized creations, all of them
But that is not to say that I also don't enjoy nature, there is something
amazing and complex just about a simple tree or blade of grass and
I love it all

you can read a little more on me, my life, feelings and attributes in 
issue 18 and it has already been discussed so I won't go into it [too much] 
here.

You can read about phoenix, my esteemed college in this little operation
in issue #4 and #15.

Well go on get back to the original page and find something interesting to 
read, but before you do I must say a few final words that have been said 
before:

I'm not going to make any guaranties that these will be spelled correctly,
or have proper grammar or that they will have the right words in them, i.e. 
orgasm instead or organism. I'll run a spell checker through them before 
I send them out and read through them once to make sure they make sense 
but that’s about it.

To be entirely truthful I can't even say that what I write will be 
interesting or fun, just that it will be the truth to the best of my 
Knowledge

And on the matter of subscriptions I will repeat here what is on the main
page and the original issue:

If you wish (for some reason) to receive a copy of this via email whenever 
I write it then send an email to steak@optushome.com.au saying just that. 
There is no automation in this system so I will have to reply to each request
and send out each issue by hand. So please be patient when waiting for your 
reply It could take two seconds and it could take two weeks, though I doubt 
it. Most replies are sent out before the end of the week. You will receive
the latest issue and keep on sending you issues until you ask me to stop or 
i get bored of it and stop writing it.
