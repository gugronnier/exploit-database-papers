This file, like all others, but especially this one, is my own opinion,
and is just that. If you have a different one, that’s good, opinions make
you who you are and define you, it's a better definition than a new
top or a credit card limit. So what can you do about it? Well do what I 
did, write a file on it, I wrote this so I get to write it from my own 
opinion. I think that’s fair. If you love it, that’s great, if you hate 
it that’s also great.

This file is on the semi-popular artist Moby

In the words of most people after encountering ACE Rimmer, "What a guy!"

I reckon his music really hits the spot.

There is something about the way that the guy plays his music, it's
different from the masses of sub-par crap you here. There is 
something in it that talks to you from such a different level
than other music, all other music.

In my opinion Moby music is very different from most other music.
 
Saying that though I really must say that this does not apply to his old
techno stuff, which is a little too techno-y for my liking. But it does 
apply for his new stuff from the album 'play' especially, and some of the
stuff from his album '18' though I reckon every single song on the 
album play, in my opinion is a total masterpiece

A lot of his music, like most has vocal lyrics in it. Only with his
lyrics, their a little different, a little 'better' if you will. Granted
the vocals are repetitive. and I personally don't like that kind of 
stuff, I can't stand repetitive techno 

I can't see anything else in that music apart from a looped beat from 
a Yamaha home organ mixed with the occasional recording from a popular 
(or non-popular in bad cases) TV show or movie, or if we are really 
unlucky they might try and remix a good old song by The Police or 
or even (god forbid) Mozart of Beethoven, with the occasional sound 
effect thrown in for good (bad) measure. Anyway if you don't like that 
it can put you off straight away.

But you have to understand, you have to look past that you have to 
see that the lyrics are (unlike other songs) not the main part of the 
track, the actual music and sounds are, and that is not repetitive

You have to open your mind and listen to the whole song, every single 
instrument, each one. The vocals are just another instrument used to 
make up the whole song. It's a little harder to listen to but it is
definitely a rewarding experience.

If you listen to a song like flower or Honey then you will see that
the vocals have there roots in spiritual blues, It's the stuff that 
the American Indians and many other native cultures used to sing
around the camp fire with an elder, they used to listen to those 
sorts of songs and go into a kind of trance, those Indians used to 
say they saw gods and sprits while listing to and singing this kind 
of music, and I can see why. There are times that I am sitting
on my own in a mellow-ly lit room listening to this kind of music
and I can swear to see gods and spirits as well.

This I feel is something that you cannot do with most music these
days, yes with the repetitive techno I mentioned before you can do
this to an extent, but that sort of music just gives me a head ache
and doesn't create the right, comfortable, secure atmosphere. In 
my opinion your mind and brain needs to be decomposed to the core 
with mind rotting, disgusting psychotropic drugs to appreciate that 
noise. Something I don't recommend under any circumstances
