Issue# 61 : What does Addendum mean to me? the Official Rendering

What Addendum means to ME, the Official Rendering.

When Steak first said to me "Hey Ferret-like man, how would you like to 
take part in the production of a web-based... er... production?" my 
immediate response was emphatic. "Why don't you," I enthused, "think 
about what you are going to say BEFORE YOU START TO SAY IT?"

The above verbal transaction was fictional, and in fact took place while 
our double-seated Galactic Terrifier Battleship was plummeting into the 
Void of Archulus, the Evil Overlord of the May-Have-Been Potential, 
home of the Crystal City, Plurality.

It does however raise a particularly gawting* particle of rant, which 
is as follows:

People give me the shits.

Not of neccesity Steak. In fact less so Steak than, say, everybody.

An example:

Me. I originally intended to write this Addenda according to PLAN. I 
had written the PLAN out very carefully, in the best manner of my Uni 
essays. It was GOING to be a balanced and accessible discussion on 
what Addendum means to ME as a more slarificious* rewrite of the 
"Rant and Rave Remix" which was (in fact as in fiction) the ORIGINAL 
MIX making this the REMIX!

Alas, PLANS play no role in my life, or my life may have got 
somewhere and would perhaps be less exciting (and perhaps much 
more so). PLANS invariably fail around me due to my own stratifinching*. 
Even now I think to myself:

How can I let it be salvage the content let it be of this essay words 
of wisdom God I hate it when it makes that noise and get back to my 
yeh let it be and when the night is original point?

Which just goes to show that PLANS have no road-train with 
stream-of-consciousness writing.

I also hate the damn world for being subject to the dictates of time. 
Oh I could write a million things about the tyranny of time. What is 
a moment? We are NEVER in the moment, for each moment passes before 
we can even process it. And you will NEVER get that moment back. Oh 
enjoy your mortality brothers, for we are ALL BEING DRAGGED INTO THE 
VOID, AND THERE'S NO TIME THERE.

Time means we can't go back. No time means we can't go anywhere.

Which means that all I am doing is fucking around the world waiting 
to die. I'm 21 and oh so fucking weary and all I want is for death 
to hurry up and consume me because I'm too fucking scared to do it 
myself and because I like my Beatles and Mozart FAR TOO MUCH!!!

Death doesn't scare me, incidentally. Its inevitability does. I 
don't pay taxes.

People I admire:

Dorothy Parker.
The three primary Marx Bros. That is: Grouch Chico and Harpo, and 
in that order reversed and randomly shuffled, then cut into strips 
and spread on a carpet.
Mozart.
Most of the composers, in fact. Includes Clapton, Lennon, Harrison, etc.
John Lennon died. What more need I say about time?
Omar Sharif.
Laurence Stern.
Joyce.
Virginia Woolf.
Too many others to mention.

	For a discussion on why the author has written PLANS in 
capitals examine James 2:6-8 and Revelation 6. Also read Ecclesiastes. 
It really rocks! Honest. And Acts. Just enjoy them as literature 
and don't take them too seriously. Particularly Ecclestiastes: 
you'll top yourself if you take it too seriously.


*gawting: throat-cruntling

*slarificious: similar to poncolikification, but without the snake.

*stratifinching: According to SBS World Guide 2002 Edition, these 
have remained stable for the past semester pending the results of 
the inquiry. Thank you.
