A war against terrorism? 

What do they think they are doing?

Are they actually so high on themselves that they think that there is even 
a remote slight chance that they could even remotely slightly win this?

Because I don't

Unless I totally miss interpret the meaning of a war on terrorism, then 
they havent got a snowballs chance in hell of winning this.

A war on terrorism means to me that they feel that they can actually wipe 
out all terrorism on this planet and make the world a safe and happy place 
for the average Joe.

This is impossible is it not?

As long as there are fascists, idiots, burocrats, dickheads and just 
generally people who have views there will be terrorists.

They are doomed to loose this "war on terror" in fact they have lost it 
already, they have no chance of winning. I don't know why they bother.

By all means try and protect your country of origin, try and block 
terrorists from flying any more jumbo jets in to buildings, but understand 
what you are trying to do here, you are trying to take revenge for something 
that a group of guys did to some of your most respected buildings. You are 
not on a special crusade from god to rid the world of evil forever. That 
is impossible.

If you wish to call this a war on terrorism, then have some sense of 
perspective. You are going to lose. Once you have wiped out one terrorist 
group their will be another one just on your backside, another just sitting 
there ready to take aim and find another loop hole in your "secure system"

And by a freak chance of coincidence you manage to wipe out all the terrorist 
groups in the world, which will not happen, another five hundred will pop 
up the next day, and they day after that, and the day after that.

Remember it only takes a group of very pissed of people to walk into a 
hardware store and buy a few box cutters to send the world trembling to 
it's knees

You going to outlaw box cutters, what about knifes? What about razor blades, 
ballpoint pens or sharp sticks?

Maybe it's just a massive propaganda war to make people think they are safe 
and make it seem like the government is on a holy crusade, hence more votes. 
When all they are really doing is declaring war on Islam.

Scratch that, getting revenge on Islam.

And another thing, the entire "if you arent with us you are against us" 
attitude from dubya is very Orwellian. It seems very sad, what if their 
was a nation witch was totally opposed to mindless violence and war, what 
if there was a nation opposed to blind patriotism and suicide missions, 
and they declared that they were not going to take sides, but instead 
spend the entire time trying to live with peace with nature, would the 
un-educated fool America has as a president drop a nuke one them. It 
wouldn't surprise me if he did.

What about the IRA, I don't see America spending much time and recourses 
to trying to hunt down their leader, have you? This is all probably 
because the IRA havent attack "the good Christian people of America" 
and also that most people in America think that IRA stands for 
"International Rifle Association"

If you ask me this entire "war on terrorism" makes me sick. If you are 
going to declare war on a country and put into force the most primitive 
human emotion (i.e. revenge) at least have the common decency to actually 
come out and say it and not hide behind political propaganda and bullshit. 
Be a man dubya. Not a mouse.

Failing that, maybe try some peaceful diplomatic missions. You know 
trying to work out your differences as mature adults instead of putting 
into force the "lets bomb everything in sight that doesn't respond to 
our (obviously correct, god told me so) way of thinking.
