========================== I Like Writing ==================================

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
This was originally an essay a gave into school, but I thought that seeing 
as it applies to the proceedings going on here I thought I would pass
it on to my loyal readers.

So without further ado I present "I like Writing"
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Writing is very therapeutic, if you are depressed, upset, angry, annoyed
at something it’s good to sit down in front of a computer screen and just
type, hit the keys, let the depths of your unconscious, just flow out
through a keyboard onto the turquoise, yellow and blue screen of q-edit.

Start of with just crap, anything goes, just type out words, and choose
words that you like. Try and relate those words to the intense feelings
that you are having. You will feel better, if that helps you move on,
start writing for fun, write stories, poems, memos, mission statements,
philosophies anything that makes you feel good. After you have written it
you will feel much better, especially if its really long. If you look at it
and it spans three or four sheets of something that you have written and it
gets you excited then you have just created something that you can love
and cherish. It doesn’t matter if everyone else loathes it because you
wrote it and in your eyes it will be the best piece of writing ever
written. If it’s spelled correctly, laid out well and grammatically
correct even more the better.

It's even more fun when, while you are writing you know that people will
read what you have written, its nice to know that you are not the only
person who's eyes will fall on your masterpiece. Even if you feel that
they will criticize and hate what you have written, it doesn't matter,
because you know that those people are not worthy to read a piece of
such epic proportions.

But how do you get your random thoughts from the screen of q-edit into the
hands of the people that have to read it. You are an armature, only just
starting out into the big writing frontier, with little or no hope of
ever getting published by any, even minor label. You could publish it
yourself, printing your whole piece all out many times and distributing
it to friends and family, but that cost a lot and you run the risk of letting 
down you protective front that tricks the outside world into thinking what
a nice, happy and all round stable kind of guy you are. People would look 
at you differently and would think you are quite strange. No that will definitely
not do.

So you resort to the total anarchy of the internet, the vast information
super highway a complete unordered mess of pages, letters, numbers, data,
IP address’s, and TCP/IP fragments flowing freely through cables under
the ground, under the sea, running high in the sky, through people’s walls
and along their floors like heroin flowing through a junkies veins.

Here everything is perfect, if it makes a mistake it’s because you screwed
up, not because it doesn't like you, feels threatened by you or thinks
your a smart ass. Nobody knows you, nobody has any prior feelings
towards you, messing up there judgment of your piece as a whole, nobody
judges, nobody at all. You can be whoever you want to be, rebirth yourself
into a new personality. Somebody else. They all just read your piece an except
it for what it is, a piece of writing that somebody poured there heart and
soul into for a few hours one night in a darkened room somewhere on a lonely
keyboard with blue light reflected on there face. If you’re lucky they may even 
imagine you doing it.

If it's no good, if its poorly written with bad spelling grammar and it looks
like it was written by a two year old then they'll chuck it out, move on, for
here you have to captivate you audience somehow. Get them to relate to your
work, feel for you and feel good about themselves. Get them interested in the
work, get them love it, but most of all get them to tell there friends. That
way more people around the world that you have never even met and don't know
you at all, have been hearing and reading you point of views. If more than
one person agrees with you than that makes you better than somebody else who
Hasn’t got his or her views to the outside wilderness. Because now two people
have the same point of view instead of just one, you automatically rise
yourself above them.

The internet is a daunting place especially if you are not familiar with it,
if you just create and make a page and publish your writing on it, it will be
unlikely that even one person will read it a year, registering with search
engines like Alta-vista and Google is useless because if people do not search
for your exact content then they will not find you, ever. Putting words like
Sex, Mp3, Asian, Free, AOL, DivX etc etc at the bottom written in a white font
on white background could bring in a few more hits, but you run the risk of
frustrating your readers and them not even touching your work.

So what do you do? Well you need to find like-minded individuals, people who
think the same as you and feel the same about the world. People that feel so
strongly that, like you they have taken to publishing there thoughts on the
world wide web. Preferably they will have more visitors than you, chances are
they do because they have been around longer than you. Get them to link to
you, bribe them with the promise that you will link to them, tell them that
you get more visitors than you actually do, self appointed webmasters are
suckers for visitors they need them to feel complete. The irony is so do
you, so do I. Use your own weakness against them, you will reap the benefits
in the long run.

Then watch as people read your stuff, regularly check your site in case you have
updated with something else for them to read and feel good about. Then the real
loyal ones send you email telling you how your work has enriched there lives
in some way, made them feel really good, how they relate to you and understand
your way of thinking how you have touched them in a very special place, making
them feel they can face the world and begging you to continue and not stop
even if they hold a gun to your head.

And that is what makes it all worth it, people now know who you are, people
feel that you have a half way intelligent view of the world. And the ones who
Don’t, well in your eyes they don't know what there talking about, because it's
in your eyes and your eyes alone that you truly get rated.

And it's in my eyes that *this* piece will truly get rated, and in my eyes,
It’s a masterpiece of epic proportions.
