============================ Normal? bah! ==================================

Ok, I heard somebody today ask the question again that angers me to the
bottom of my very being

So I have decided to answer it, once and for all and clear up the mess.

The conversation I over heard went a little like this:

Person one: "If you go outside right now you can see many many people
            who do not fit the definition of normal"
Person two: "yes, that’s all very well and good but you have to ask
            yourself the question, what is normal???"
Person one: [disgusted look]

Just incase you missed it the intriguingly infamous question is "what is
normal?"

If someone asks it and expects to get an intelligent response it shows
that they are not thinking properly and that they want to seem superior
and intelligent by asking "theoretical" questions and sparking a debate
about it so they can discuss it more. Please there are more important
things to debate.

More importantly it just shows that they have just repeated a question
that is over and over again asked by people who don't know normal for
one reason and one reason alone.

They just cannot find themselves for all the layers of superficiality that
surround them.

They must brake through these layers, be themselves, not what the trend
tells them to be and then and only then will they realize that normality
is what they are inside, and nothing more.

Don't ask me the question again or I will go insane

The end.
