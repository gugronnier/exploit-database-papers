Issue# 54 : Not bright ideas

I cannot believe what I am watching right now....

It's a program called "bright ideas" in England there was a program
called bright ideas and it was about kids who could do really cool
scientific things and things that most other kids couldn't do

This version is something totally different. This is a program that at
first glance looks to be about things that are going wrong or aren’t
fair in the market place, mush like the English show 'Watchdog"

But alas it is not, it is actually a collection of fifteen minuet
adverts, no kidding and they actually have advertisements break

The OURGUIDE TV guide describes the program as "All the latest news 
and best advice for home improvement options. Hosted by Warwick Moss."

How ever it is not, it is just a collection of adverts. You can tell 
that it's only for the companies that can afford to have there fifteen
minuets shown on this program. Because it only has adverts for the
big companies like Telstra and national bank.

It's insane, I have never tuned into watch adverts for a whole
hour. It's not even the 5am shopping channel. it's bloody 1pm! 
prime time! they could show star trek right now for an hour, what 
a shamble.

It really makes me angry!
