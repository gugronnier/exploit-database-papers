Issue# 46 : Calico Shubunkins
10th May 2002

========================================================================

I'm watching my fish right now,

I know that it seems really trivial and just a little bit sad but fish
have always really fascinated me.

I have two fish, two little Calico Shubunkins in a  little tank, one is
orange with a touch of grey, his name is Michael after the great python
Michael Palin, and the other is grey with a touch of orange, his name
is Eric after the other great python Eric Idle. I thought it only
fitting to name them after my two favorite pythons because their
behavior closely resembles the Monty Python crew’s antics.

I bought them only the day before yesterday, they cost be $2.90c
Australian each, I think that’s a good price, they were like $3.50c
around the corner. The tank was $16 and Kim bought that for me,
which was nice of her. She got some gold fish as well on the same day
she got me the tank, hers are called Buffy and Spike. (yes, from Buffy 
the vampire slayer)

Fish have no cerebral cortex, which makes them only just a slight bit
more intelligent than a strawberry truffle, they defiantly don't
even have a temporal lobe not even a small one, which means that the 
cannot appreciate music, but sometimes I cannot help but wonder if
Michael is flipping his little tail to the beat of Beethoven or Holst

They dart around madly all day, up the tank, down it, backwards, 
forwards, sidewards everywhere. Some times I also think that they 
somehow want to get out of their tank and explore the outside world.

However the outside world is far from marine, if it was, I would let
them swim around the room, however it is not. So they probably would not 
survive two minuets out here, its far to dry for them.

I wonder what Beethoven sounds like underwater, probably
a little too much bass, I guess it just all seems like noise to them.
the greatest works of music ever produced sound like nothing to
these two little characters, rather sad actually, they go their 
entire life never being able to experience the 9th symphony or
Holst's planets.

It seems strange, their entire world is encased in this little
tank twelve inches by six, I would not like it, but I guess if 
I was a fish I would be too stupid to understand what it meant
to be in a tank.

Swim, Eat, Swim, Eat, Shit, Swim, Swim, Swim, bang into glass, Swim

I guess that's all they are thinking. Again rather sad, going your
entire life thinking nothing but that. never to have nice long thoughts
about the nature of the world or themselves, never to read a book or
see a movie.

But I think they have their fun, bobbing up and down, doing all manner
of crazy things,

Well they’re nice to look at anyway.
