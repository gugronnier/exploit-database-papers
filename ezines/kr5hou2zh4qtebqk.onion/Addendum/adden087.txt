 	 'Little Aden' By Steak
	¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

Little Aden was having a birthday party. His friend little Johnny came
over and looked at his ‘happy birthday’ banner.

Johnny looked for a while and then asked why it was little Aden was
celebrating his one year, three month and one day birthday as apposed
to celebrating his one-year birthday like most normal people.

Aden wondered about this and said,
	"well why do you celebrate your birthday every year and not
	your birthday, three months and one day?"

Johnny was disgruntled by this and declared right there and then that
little Aden was a ‘stupid pooh pooh head’

Upset by this uncharacteristic out lash of profanity Aden burst into
tears.

	"Your so silly little Johnny!" he cried "the truth of the
	matter is that I was bored with my surroundings, I was annoyed
	with my life, it was becoming something I didn’t like. Then a
	whole load of shit came up and I had to go away! I didn’t want
	to, but I had to, anyway, the fuzz has died down now and as a
	result, I’m back. Unfortunately while I was away I missed my
	birthday, so I decided when I got back to celebrate my
	birthday plus the amount of time I’ve missed since then, give
	me a break baby!"
	"Well then" said little Johnny "Why did you decide to
	celebrate your birthday, three months and one day instead of
	just having a ‘welcome back’ party?"
	"Because I wanted to be different!" was all little Aden could
	think to say.

And he was right, he was different.
