MUTILATION SHOCK FIND

A young man is recovering today after discovering that the book he was 
reading had been horrifically mutilated.

The man, identified only as ‘Phoenix’, was relaxing in bed last night with 
the victim, “Portnoy’s Complaint”, when he made the gruesome discovery.

Authorities commented that it “appears that pages 133 to 156 are missing”, 
though they admit the possibility that more pages are missing “has not been 
ruled out”.

Shortly after they were called, the police organized a press conference. 
“As of yet we have no suspects,” said a spokesperson at the hastily 
assembled meeting. “This could be a very old crime. We have no motive, 
no forensic evidence. No leads at all.”

The find, which occurred on the eve of ‘Phoenix’s’ 21st birthday, has 
left him deeply disturbed. “I know it sounds insensitive, but I’ll have 
to find another copy. I mean, I can’t just leave the story hanging,” he 
said, holding back tears. “I just wanted to relax with the book. I 
wasn’t expecting… this.”

A spokesperson from the Victorian Police Missing Pages Department 
warned that thousands of pages go missing every year. “Probably 
ninety percent of missing pages are due to old age. However more 
and more pages are falling foul of negligence and even vandalism.”

The investigation is continuing.
