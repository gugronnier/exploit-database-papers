 You're sitting at home, drinking eggnog and munching on Christmas candy,
 reading System Failure #7. Happy Holidays! The fireplace is crackling and
 you're chillin with your loved ones.. maybe you're totally and completely
 bored cuz your parents dragged you to your horrid aunt's smelly house. This
 action-packed issue has everything from hilarious to serious and even
 inspirational articles.

 System Failure has been a project of Penguin Palace since February of 1997
 when I visited San Jose on bahalf of TAG (Tuffmen Against Guns, an anti-gang
 and anti-kids-having-guns group that I work with at times). It's grown from
 a standard text zine to a thriving community of thought and development. I
 hope that through writing and understanding the articles published in this
 zine that you acquire a taste for further knowledge; that the issue leaves
 you thinking, "w0ah, I didn't know you could do that!" or "That sounds like
 it takes a lot of work, but good to know" or "I can't believe Company X pulls
 shit like that. I'm going to do something about that." When we cover news
 stories or legal issues, it's to keep everyone informed about events that
 they're too lazy to stay on top of. How many of you seriously look through
 the newspaper in the morning, keep pointcast running, watch 30 mins of CNN,
 or even just visit a few news webpages? By including information from such
 sources, we add a new angle to boring news.

 Another moon is setting, another year is ending. With the advent of 1998,
 we already have some special plans for DefCon VI. We will again hold a
 weird wacky scavenger hunt with neato nifty prizes, but we're also creating
 a second hunt for the second day. It'll require special equiptment to
 participate; you'll need to be able to scan cell frequencies and decode
 dtmf tones. That's all we'll say for now. We'll also be selling a CD with
 all of the issues and contents, as well as our favorite techno songs, and
 perhaps some of our own creations. We'll have Penguin Palace comics and the
 all new TORI DO cd, which is scheduled to release in May. You can pre-order
 that CD from me for $25.00, and I'll also send you some original artwork.

 Expect a huge change to www.sysfail.org come New Years, changes to the bot
 structure of #peng on EFnet, and sysfail irc servers on some of the
 smaller networks (like FEFnet). Have a safe and happy holiday, Merry
 Christmas, Happy New Year, Happy Hannakuh, Happy 12 days of Xmas, and
 don't leave the milk out too long for Santa cuz it'll get spoiled and he
 won't give you that CD-R you asked for.

"Police in Springfield Illinois are red faced.  They had fallen victim to a
conman who illegaly tapped into the phone system to bill the city for three
long distance calls to Africa.  Authourities say that three calls were made
by somone who called the main number and asked to be transferred to an
extension.  The man claimed to be a telephone company inspector who needed
to check a number; once the transfer was made the man made the three calls
which ultimatley cost the department $468.  Several busnisess and
organizations, including a police department in Alabama, have falled victim to
the same scam recently, however, Springfield police say they never heard of
it until they got their phone bill with the long distance calls."

               From Aether to Ether - A Recurring Column by
    He Who Will Call Himself: Enola Gay(sysfail@linux.slackware.org)
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

WELCOME:
	And, with this sentence, a journey of thought begins.  This series
of columns will be written in the sole hope of spreading a simple
infection - a desease of burning; a wonderfully clear and intense sense
of self-betterment in learning only to learn; a leprosy of every cranial
lobe.
	It is this author's opinion, however, that we cannot begin to reap
the rewards such knowledge is known to spew forth until we can grasp from
wence it has come.  The origins of any new base of knowledge are at
least as essential and critical for its later use as the knowledge,
itself.  Therefore, we will cover, if even only slightly at times,
everything in a bottom-up fashion; thus, the appropriate title.
	The ancient thinkers, while just beginning such treks in knowing
the world around them, explained the "lack of things" or that of which
"nothing" is made as being a substance called "Aether."  (Of course, they
were much more simple than we, and had no ideas about vaccuums nor just
the idea that there could be a "nothing" which required no "something" to
define it.)
	Today, we have a marvelous thing called "ethernet" which is used
from connecting machines and other devices in the smallest home LAN to
connecting the largest and newest of switched networks in the
little-thought-of NAPs of the world.  Civilized man, all over this
increasingly smaller planet, now has a common bond; one which, when
implemented properly, and combined with an "internet," has virtually no
chance of failure.  Too, this bond can do nothing but promote free
thinking in those who are capable of such, and in the very least,
understanding.  With our ether, we are able to more steadily avoid the
misconceptions of the Aether of yore. This bond of networking can, at
times, seem a stronger bond than blood, itself.  All of this given, there
exists one thing which is even more wonderful:  It will only get better,
my friends...

                 From Aether to Ether: Born from Defense
                             by Enola Gay

	Though most may scorn the war machines of yesteryear,
unfortunately it is they which have served to allow some of our greatest
strides forward.  If it were not for the new bomb factories and airplane
sales of the early world wars, many more might have been stuck in the
depths and the aftermath of the largest economical depression our country
has ever seen. If it were not for the fear of the cancerous growth of the
Marxist Misinterpreter, we would have most certainly been much later to
reach our only heavenly satellite.  And, if it were not for the fear of
the loss of communications in the eminant cold war, the Internet would not
have been born.
	Most of us have heard or read something, in a preface or in a
historic introduction to an entirely different subject matter, regarding
the association of The Internet to its start by a governmental department
once known as ARPA.  ARPA, the "Advanced Research Projects Agency", was
created by the United States' "Department of Defense," or DoD, in 1958.
Renamed "Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency," or DARPA, in 1972
[ARPA/IPTO 1997], this subsection of Big Brother's defensive shield was
the major contributor to the birth of The Internet.

    DARPA has gone through three major periods in its lifetime: (1) a
    period, into the mid-1960s, dominated by the "presidential" issues
    that brought the Agency into being in 1958 after the launch of
    Sputnik--space, ballistic missile defense, and nuclear test
    monitoring; (2) a period of exploration and probing from the
    mid-1960s to mid-1970s, characterized by relatively diverse research
    programs, varying from R&D support for the Vietnam War effort to the
    beginnings of DARPA's long history of involvement in advanced
    computing; and (3) a period of major technological thrusts that began
    in 1975 and has continued until the present.  [ARPA 1997]

	Most authors who wish to use some flavor of a summary of this
awesome beginning do not give it nearly the justice of thought which it
deserves.  We find that the majority will only go so far as to mention
that ARPA had the first "internetwork" (ARPAnet) and that it was based on
open research, where all involved could more easily give and partake of
each others' ideas.  While this was one outcome, it was not the initial
reason for its formation.
	In the late 1960s, ARPA was given a goal: create a network which,
even if entire sections were destroyed, would be able to continue routing
traffic around the damaged sections and survive.  This would allow the
major defensive military sites to continue to communicate and defend the
country.  With the then-new packet switching technology just coming to
reality [IBM 1995], their goal was very obtainable.
	"The first international connections of today's Internet were made
from the U.S. to England and Norway in 1973." [IBM 1995]  This being the
case, we will soon be in a position to celebrate the 25th Anniversary of
the true birth of the Internet, brothers.  How could such a celebration
possibly reflect our advancement?  Perhaps we have an obligation to give a
piece of ourselves back to this non-living entity called the Internet, in
the spirit of the freedom of thought it has always offered us.
	Three years ago, now (in 1995), it was estimated that the Internet
encompassed more than three million hosts and 30 million users around this
planet, with a 15% increase every month, and "every 30 minutes, a new
network signs on to the Internet." [IBM 1995].

     If the number of people using the Internet were to keep doubling
     every year, then
       On December 25, 1997:
     There would be 123,824,052 people using the Internet.
     (This represents 2.06 % of the world's population). [Orenstein 1995]

That is approximately 123 million minds, collectively interacting on a
common medium.  This number is "doubling every year" according to
Orenstein, who is drawing his statistics from John S. Quarterman, himself.
Even with doubling, however, it is already a very large number of people
to be gathering thoughts and ideas in such an efficient manner.  There is
little stopping such a mass movement.  It will continue to increase at
such rates and more.
	What has it all given to us?  It would do each and every one of us
well to take a few minutes and think about that, even if only now on its
anniversary.  Because some of these minds specialize in lawn mower
maintainance [M&D Mower 1997], we can perhaps skip a trip to our local
mower shop.  Because some of these minds are interested in proper
etiquette at the poker table [Tropicana 1997], we can gamble more
politely.  Because so many of these researching minds are sharing
information on new subatomic particles [New exotic particle 1997], we can
remain well-informed about the meson family at all times.
	Does your mind have anything to offer the rest?  Do you possess
any information which could be beneficial to other minds on this
wonderful, new, but quickly-aging, medium?  Will you always rather only
take from it without contributing?  Thanks to the rest of us, you have
that option.  But, then, the rest of us will be deciding what is shared
and what is not shared.  Consider this article a call to all who hold some
piece, no matter how seemingly small, of knowledge, information, and/or
talent to share what they have over the medium which will continue to
unstoppingly give them the information they seek.  Imagine what we could
leave our children with in the next 25 years.  Our legacy can and will
overcome the cesspools of economic trouble our parents left for us.

Long live good information.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
Everyone asks me on irc, "stainer, how can I own people using the government's
NCIC database?" I am going to tell you the secrets of NCIC database
hacking.

NCIC terminals are in virtually every police department in the United States
of America. NCIC stands for National Crime Information Computer and it holds
info to all criminal records in America. With it, you can type in a name and
date of birth and get reams of inph0z on your friends and enemies. Find out
that the loser at 7-11 has been arrested 4 times for molesting little girls,
and your phr34king experience will be increased.

The hardest way to haxx0r the NCIC database is trying to go through the the
Department of Justice mainframe. Here is an example of how to do it.

shell:~# telnet ncic.usdoj.gov
Trying 149.101.10.33
Connected to ncic.usdoj.gov.
Escape character is '^]'.

Welcome to the United States Department of Justice NCIC computer.

And thats all there is to haxx0ring NCIC from home. Now on to getting access
from your local police department.

Just go down to you local police department and march up to the glass
window. With a few supplies, you will be on NCIC within minutes.

<Huge Obese Dispatcher> What the hell do you want, you little punk?
<Haxor Wannabe> I want to be a cop, and I was hoping to get a tour of
dispatch.
<Dispatcher> Get the hell out of here before I break your arm.
<Haxor> I have a bag of snickers bite sized for you.
<Dispatcher> Well come on in, you little angel.
<Haxor> (after getting into dispatch) Here are your snickers, ma'am, can I
look around?
<Dispatcher> Sure, just leave me alone. (munch munch)

After the police officers find you and violate your civil rights for several
hours, you'll know that you are an elite, k-rad haxor.

                All I Want For Christmas Are My Telco Docs
                    By skullY (skully@clipper.net)
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
Driving his '76 Mercedes 300D through the streets of Argo, skullY scouts
out the building. The car is neither quiet nor fast. He pops out the tape
thats been playing for the last 2 hours and puts in another tape, which
he knows just as well as the first. Mr. Sonik is in the passenger seat
getting ready for the job at hand. skullY finds a good spot and parks the
car, plunging the area into silence as he turns off the key. Throwing on
his coat and putting an ear piece in his ear, he quietly gets out of the
car. Sonik creeps out in front and looks around. No cars coming. They
silently run through the meadow which the car was parked in, and climbed
over to the fence. Luckily, US West isn't too bright and they were able
to climb with ease thanks to the incredibly large holes in the cyclone fence.

Once inside, each knows what they have to do. skullY double checks his
scanner before running over to the large floodlight with the exposed wire.
Being careful only to touch the insulated part of the cutter, he snips the
wire and watches the light go out. With that accomplished, Sonik runs over
to the first truck and uses a slim jim to open the door. He knows
exactly what to look for and goes about his search. Meanwhile, skullY
lights a cigarette and starts on the second truck.

Thirty minutes and 8 trucks later, they move onto the building. Each is
nervous because they don't know if there's an alarm or not. Getting out
his custom key, a piece of sheet metal precisely cut to fit between the
door and frame, skullY opens the door. No audible alarm, and nothing on
the scanner about an alarm at the CO. skullY moves in first, followed
closely by Sonik. They wonder why there's been nothing on the scanner, but
then again, it's Christmas Eve and all the pigs are probably either home
drinking eggnog and eating donuts or out nabbing the drunk drivers.

After a few minutes of searching inside, they hit the jackpot. A laptop
and a pile of binders labelled "US West RCMAC training manual. For
authorized personal only." What luck, one of them has the access
number and passwords they'll need to get in. They shovel it all into their
backpacks and make a hasty exit. 

Just outside the building, they see headlights coming. Ducking down
quickly, they wait for it to pass. Unfortunately, it stops, and a spot
light starts blaring at them from 50 ft. away. After crouching there for
five minutes watching the light go back and forth, they see the cop get
out of the car. He stops right in front of them on the other side of the
fence. Deciding to let go of reason and let instincts take over, Sonik and
skullY run for it. The make the short 20 ft. to the fence on the other
side of the yard and scramble over it. The cop, who looked like he enjoyed
his dounuts, barely got over the fence.

With the adrenaline rushing through their veins, they ran to a nearby
stand of trees. The grove was thick and with many bushes. They stashed
their bags under a bush and started running towards the road. By the time
they hit the 3rd block, the cop was outta site and had probably given up.
Just to be safe, they stopped and had a cigarette and kept an ear on the
scanner. After an hour, they heard the pig report that he was giving up on
the search and heading back to HQ. The two cautiously made their way back to
the beat up Mercedes. Getting in, they drove over to the stand of trees
they stashed their bags in. Grabbing them, they drove home. Once home,
they had their own Christmas. But instead of getting ties, socks, and
useless junk, they got what they really wanted.

                               Fun With AmTrak
                   By The PBX Phreak (pbxphreak@unixnet.org)

Hello b0yz and g1rls. Just sit back and relax, fasten your seatbelt and
enjoy the ride, because after reading this you will be able to do exactly
that. VIA Amtrak.

I am from Canada and on a recent trip to the US I used this method on a
regular basis. This actually has been one of my many experiences. This is
not made up.

What You need To use:
--------------------
a) Your Bag Packed full of your stuff
b) Full Info Credit Card
c) Payphone or a Cloned Cell Phone
d) Deep voice (not those pussy voices you hear on c0nfz)

If you dont gno where to get credit cards. Well here is a few places

 - Hack into p0rn sites and grab the database (if you can haxor)
 - Trashing
 - Stealing cardz from yer parents
 - Stealing someones purse on the Sub-Way

After you got yerself a full info credit card, you are all set.

Typical Telephone Converstaion:
------------------------------
 YOU: DIAL 1-800-USA-RAIL
 OP : Hello, AmTrak How Can I help You?
 YOU: Yes, My cousin has lost his id, and he is stranded, I need to order
      Him a ticket. Is this possible.
 OP : Yes, this is called a prepaid ticket.
 YOU: Ok, I would like to do that then.
 OP : Where is he located at?
 YOU: He is in Dallas, Texas.
 OP : Ok. Where does he want to travel too.
 YOU: Home of course, which is in Tampa, Florida
 OP : Ok, There is a train leaving at 1:30pm, is that ok?
 YOU: Yes that is fine. What is the one way fair?
 OP : $119.28 is the one way fair.
 YOU: Thats great.
 OP : Now, that is all settled, I need the passengers name.
 YOU: Nathan Winters (made up name)
 OP : You said he lost his ID, well we can put a password on the ticket. He
      Will just have to give the agent the password when he goes and picks up
      the ticket.
 YOU: I guess the password will be "cheese", do you except Mastercard
 OP : Thankyou, that will be his password, and Yes we do except mastercard,
      what is the card #?
 YOU: 5371-2881-0191-7882 and that expires in 03/98
 OP : Thank you Sir. Remember to tell him to be at the terminal 1 hour before
      his train leaves. So he should be there at 12:30 for his 1:30 train.
 YOU: Thank You for your help.
 OP : Thankyou for Choosing AmTrak.

Now that you have done all that.. All you have to do is walk up to the counter
at the AmTrak station and say "I have a ticket waiting for me," and be sure to
tell them the password. They will print up the ticket, and you're all set. 
REMEMBER. ENJOY THE RIDE!!.

 HINT --> Anything could happen while yer on the trip, free food, hotel,
          train crash, you name it.. anything.. well Have Phun.

 P.S  --> You could also order a room on the train. But make sure you have
          enough credit on the card. I never ordered the room, but you can
          try. Anything is possible when on AmTrak.

True Story:
----------
 On one of my trips on AmTrak a funny thing happened. At the time I was in
 San Jose, California. I got a ticket from San Jose to Schofield, Wisconsin.
 But there was a problem, we were delayed on the track for 2 and a half hours
 becuase of this we all missed our connecting train from Portland, Oregon to
 Wisconsin. The next train for Wisconsin wasn't going to leave for another
 2 nights. So AmTrak paid for my meals and hotel for 2 nights, so you never
 gno what yer getting into.

Conclusion:
----------
 I used this method a lot while I was in the US. So I wouldn't be so suprised
 if this method dies, After me explaining this to all the world. Or whoever
 is reading this article, and remember THANKYOU FOR ABUSING AMTRAK!

 This has been for informational purposes only!! :)

 Firewalling Your Linux Boxen, Part 2: Using a Linux Box to Firewall your LAN. 
                   By Dr. Seuss (drs@linux.slackware.org)                    
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

This article assumes you have read part 1 of my firewall series and have
your machine configured as stated in that article.  All examples in this
article come from a machine running linux 2.0.32, with lo, ppp0, and eth0
interfaces.  The linux box is acting as a router for a LAN with a entire
Class C routed to it.  The linux box's eth0 is assigned the address of
192.168.1.1

The first thing you want to do is allow access from your LAN to your linux
box, assuming you trust those on your LAN.  Allowing pings and other messages
from your LAN make diagnoses of problems much easier.

Only  2 lines are needed to accomplish this,  place them after you default
policies.

ipfwadm -I -a accept -S 192.168.1.0/24 -D 0/0 -W eth0
ipfwadm -O -a accept -S 192.168.1.0/24 -D 0/0 -W eth0

This allows all traffic from your local LAN to be accepted by the linux box.

In our previous example we used a -D 0/0 for all the rules blocking ICMP
messages, this will suffice to protect our LAN as well. If you want to use
Microsoft networking across the Internet, you may want to modify the rule that
blocks access to port 139. Add this rule above it.

ipfwadm -I -a accept -S 192.168.1.0 -D 0/0 -W eth0

Then modify the original line to look like this.

ipfwadm -I -a deny -P tcp -S 0/0 -D 192.168.1.1 139 -o

Now machines on your LAN can accept traffic on port 139, this is neccesary
if you use VPN Tunneling or similar, if not you may not need to do this.

You will also want to deny packets coming from the Internet claiming to be
from your LAN, this is done with the following command.

ipfwadm -I -p deny -S 192.168.1.0/24 -D 0/0 -W 0/0

You LAN is now secure from many exploits used today, as with all security,
these rules may need to be tweaked in order to work properly in your
configuration.

Now for the fun part.  I'm sure you have users on your LAN, that are
bandwidth hogs, using Real Audio all day, updating Pointcast, using AOL over
TCP or similar.  Here is your chance to get back at them.  For example,
lets pretend that your co-worker roy, is always listening to real audio,
hogging your bandwidth, and that his machine is assigned the IP of
192.168.1.50 You could make a small file (mine is called ra-off) that looks
like this

#/bin/bash
ipfwadm -I -a deny -P udp -S 0/0 7070 -D $1/32

This allows you to say "ra-off 192.168.1.50" and block the real audio stream
to roy's machine.  About 30 seconds after you do this, he will get that
annoying "Network Congestion rebuffering" message that tells him the net is
slow today and to try later.  I also have a script called "ra-on" which
turns the Real Audio stream back on, it looks like this

#/bin/bash
ipfwadm -I -d deny -P udp -S 0/0 7070 -D $1/32

You can create many scripts that have the same general syntax, adjusting for
protocols and ports.  You can also create more elaborate scripts that can
give you status message as to who is denied access to what.  I am
considering writing a Firewall Part 4, outlining some of my custom firewall
scripts.

This article was intended to be a reference and starting point for those
wanting to build a secure linux firewall.  I try to stay as general as
possible since the rules you enforce will greatly differ depending on your
network and needs.  My e-mail is always open to those with questions or
comments. 

Apologies for the short length of this article, but I have been terribly
busy preparing for the holidays.  

Until Firewall Part 3.

                How To Get Your Very Own TDD/TTY Phone
                    By Gwonk (gwonk@diversion.com)
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
Certain public areas are required to have a phone for the deaf to use.  If
you are deaf, procurring one of these phones for free shouldn't be a
problem.  If you've ever seen a TDD machine in an airport or other public
facility, it is because they are required to have them.  In smaller
towns, they often don't have the TDD machine out for everyone to use.
This is a great advantage to a person who wants one, and the only person
who doesn't want one is Freddie the Phone Fraud Fox; everyone else has a
use for it.

So, where the hell do I go to pick up one of these phones?  First you
have to find someplace that is public enough to need one, but not big
enough to have one built in to the payphone.  In small towns, the police
station, the hospital, and a mall will have at least one for public use.
There should be a sign near the payphone that tells you where one is. In
the mall they are usually in the service counter, and in hospitals they
are usually at the front desks of the area that you are in.

You must first select a target to get the phone from.  In my example I
will use the police station, because it makes things much harder and you
have the worse case scenerio.  Find the payphone in the police station,
and make sure they don't have a TDD phone for public use anywhere in the
building.  Go and ask the person at the desk for a TDD phone, and in a
small town you will usually need to tell them what it is. Persistance will
get you everywhere because you are probably the first person to ask them
for one, they might not be able to find one right away. If they ask you
why and you are not "conveniently" deaf, then you can tell them that you
need to call your grandmother or your sister and ask them what else you
need to pick up at the store. Once you have the machine in your posession,
you can do three things to get it out of there.

1.  Take the phone in your hand, walk toward the payphone, and
then walk right out the door carrying it in your hand.
2.  Take the phone to the payphone, play with it for a while, then
put it in a duffel bag, then walk out with it.
3.  Have a friend come in and take it and beat you up, then go
crying to the cop that someone asaulted you and stole it.  Have a
description ready that matches your best friend.

I personally wouldn't have the balls to do the first one unless I had a
few beers in me.  I still think it is the best idea.  Cops and anyone
who understands human nature expects you to be sneaky when you steal.
When ever I steal from a store or a public place, I usually try to be as
blatant about it as possible.  If I am stealing a pack of smokes, I pick it
up in the cigarette section and then buy something while I am packing the
cigarettes like I already own them.  The same thing applies here. If they
stop you, you can just say that you were going to take it to the payphone
down the way because it has cheaper rates.  Just about any excuse you have
ready, they will fall for because you didn't try to hide it.

                How to Make Your Own K-Rad Payphone Lamp
           satire by hatred on a log (hatredonalog@hotmail.com)
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
So you want one of those elite payphone lamps?  That is no problem...
IF you follow my guide to making your own.  It is quite easy, and you
will have tons of fun showing it off to your local lineman, or calling
up the local billing office to tell them how nicely one of their pay-
phones converted into desk lamp!  Everyone loves them!  Old people,
infants, Roy Gerbil, and of course Jim Bayless!
         
First, you're going to need some parts and tools:

Crowbar
Payphone
Bulb Socket
Outlet plug
Good teeth
Outlet
Phone Line
Lamp Shade & Attachment

Instructions:
You have everything EXCEPT the payphone, right?  This is the best
part of the project... stealing the phone.  Go downtown or wherever
you know there is a payphone at and use the crowbar to take it.  If
there are any old folks around, make them leave; tell them that you
don't like how they smell or something.  Make sure you tell everyone what
you're going to do first.  Post it on all your local BBS's with you real
name.  Timing is quite essential; I would recommend trying it in the
middle of the afternoon, during Octoberfest is quite perfectly the best
time.  If a cop asks you what you think your doing, tell him to go to hell,
or just say that you are your own person and that no-one can tell you what
to do! Start talking about how you learned to stand up for yourself and they
will understand.

Getting the Payphone back to your house is easy.  All you have to do
is get your mom to give you a ride there so you don't have to carry
it around on the Public Transit. They don't like people carrying
payphones around on their buses.  Other things they don't like are
you shooting up on heroin on the way to the mall (the other drop-off
sites are okay), and you bringing your pet gerbil on board (they make
you pay even though he's going to stay in your pocket!)

Now that you have a payphone of your very own, it's time to make it
into a lamp!  Remember in 7th grade when you made those elite bottle
lamps? Get it out and tear all the parts off of it, or if all you have
is your mother's living room lamps, then use that.  Breaking it open
is easy.  Remember the side of your house?  Bashing it on the wall usually
seems to do the trick.  Mothers always understand if you tell them that
you're a phreak.  Forge a note from some guy named Roy that you can,
then she'll let you for sure!  If she's your stepmom, then smack her
up a bit with your elite redbox you bought off the internet.  If
your dad asks you what you're doing, give him your "two cents on the whole
abortion issue."  Try to be mean, offensive and generally lame.  If
that don't work, throw your gerbil at him.

Get out those teeth and start chewing a 1/8 in. hole near the bottom,
and don't stop until you get all the way through.  Once you're done with
that, then chew an appropriate sized hole at the top of the payphone.
Run the power line through the holes, and hook it up to the socket.
Jam the socket in there, as far as you feel fit.  If you really want
to be k-rad then you can use a colored light, because it is more
awesome.  When doing the smaller hole you might also trying to scratch
your way in too.

Hook up your phone line to the back.  Plug it in and flip the switch
by the bulb.

Now its time for the lamp shade. I would reccomend something in a
floral pattern.  Not too light, with lots of outrageous colors like
bright green and pink.  Make sure there are also pink flamingos on
there, otherwise it will not be lucky and 1800-MY-ANI-IS will come
and kill you.

Guess what else you get with this neat elite thing?  Calls from a pay-
phone without having to put money in or even using a Red Box! Cool huh?

What to do with your neat toy:

o  Get a whole bunch made up and sell them in your front yard.

o  Sell them to local stores and be a wholesaler

o  Mount them all over your house and run around yellin "I am a phone
   freak!" until your mom makes you stop.

o  Use it for biege boxing.

o  Donate it to your local homeless shelter.

o  Use it as your science fair project.

o  Bring it in for show and tell.

o  Set it up at home and blue box.

o  bother OCI.

o  Use it with your audio-cupler and your super-fast 8088.

Hope you all love your new toy, and remember:  "The art of Phone Phreaking
won't live forever; Newbies just want free calls."

He sits in a box all day
   Leaving sometimes for school
   Visits a payphone or three
Surrounded by loved ones he cannot see
   The walls are white and blank
   Echoed voices bounce through a system
With rules that he can break
   He has the connections
   He is a pimp in the digital world
All day he sits in a box
   Lights flicker in his window
   Crowds gather to exchange gifts
Lost in his eagerness
   To learn and practice his skillz
   Twelve days of Christmas slide by
A letter slides under the door
   Weary from a week of delivery
   Rainsmeared handwriting outside
Pale wraithlike hands sear open the card
   Splashes of color spreading Christmas cheer
   Not digital or electronic in any way
A hot tear splashes freely

              Getting Free Pop Out of Vending Machines
              by Spanish Prince (smartass@sekurity.org)
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
Let's say you're outrunning the cops after being spotted in your local
telco yard looking for goodies and you're nearly out of breath.  You're
tired, you're thirsty, you're exhausted.  As you outrun the fatassed donut
eating cop, you see a coke machine, you reach into your pocket and all you
have in it is your redbox and your list of k0d3z.  Don't despair, you can
still get your favorite carbonated beverage for free.

Here's what you are gonna need:

1. Vending machine out of sight of the road/houses (hopefully indoors)

2. Something to hold the flap of the pop machine up (optional)

3. A little bit of pain tolerance

The first thing you're gonna need to do is to make sure no one is around
the pop machine you're gonna rip off.  If there's no one there then you can
work without worrying about anyone asking questions.  A better idea is to get
a friend to keep watch while you go to work on the pop machine.

What you're going to be doing is lifting up the flap where the pop comes out
while your other hand is reaching up into the pop machine searching for pop.
Ideally, you will have an object to prop the flap up so that you can hold up
the other side of the flap, but this is not necessary.

When you're reaching up there, you will notice that the pop is stored in
vertical columns, and the order is reverse of what is on the selection
area, meaning if pepsi is the first one, it will be on the far right and
not the far left.  All you need to do is to have your hand up the pop
machine and pulling down a can with a little force.  You want to work from
left to right as the left is easier to get pop cans out of than the right.
You can usually get out 3 cans per time you have your hand up there unless
you have a big arm.  You can easily clean out the all of the flavors in as
little as 3 minutes.

Right now, it would best to just leave, unless you are sure you won't get
caught because to get to the next column, it takes more time.  What you're
going to do is try to feel for a metal holder deep into the column.
You're going to want to slam this down to release all of the next can of
pop, which you will pull down like all of the others.  Usually you can
only get about 2 this way because pulling down on the holders really tears
up your arm.


As a consequence of doing this, the next person to deposit money and make
their selection hit the button and get nothing but hearing the pop machine
lowering the pop it thinks is still in there which you took out, but you
don't really care because you'll have at least 10 cans of pop while
they'll have nothing.

Greets out to #couzin-ed on EDnet, #peng on the EF, #tacd, #rock, and all
those niggers on dalnet's #bbb.

-Note from pinguino: Spee lives in some hick state where the machines are
older. I'm note sure if this would work on the newer ones, or the ones
with bottles. Most have the flap (flap!?@) set up so that it pretty much
closes up the opening. Another thing that sometimes (rarely) works is by
yanking the dollar back out with a thin piece of transparency taped to it.
You can get the transparency cheap or sometimes free from Kinkos (tell them
you need a piece for the self-service copiers, loiter a bit in the back,
and leave.)

                           Samples, Anyone?
               by Interrupt (interruption@hotmail.com)
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
This scam involves a little loophole that mail-order companies have: Free
business samples. They give these out to companies they think are going to
buy their products in the future if they like it. You're probably
thinking, "Does this work?" The answer is Yes. I have tried this with Mouser
Electronics three times. I ordered a 6.5536 crystal each time. My friends
have used this same scam to get free computer programming books and
electronic manuals.

First, find a company that has something you want. Call up the phone
number and ask if they give out free business samples. If they do, then
keep reading. If not, then find a new company. There are many companies
that give out business samples; you just have to be patient. Here are a few
things you will need to prepare ahead of time:

1.A fake Business name
2.A name and address to ship the merchandise to
3.A fake phone number

--A few tips. For the business name make it sound real i.e. use something
like Roberts Computer Repair instead of Computer Parts Inc. There are two
reasons. First, you don't want the name to sound fake and second, you don't
want the company to look up that business name and find that you ordered
from them previously. Personally, I have always used a fake name like
George Roberts or John East. Also, the address does not have to be a drop
site; it can be your own house. I've successfully sent two samples to my
house and nothing has ever happened. If you're paranoid and have a drop site,
ship there.  You don't necessarily need a catalog or have seen the webpage of
company you are scamming.  You could call up and ask if thay have something
you want then call back and do the scam. I prefer to have a catalog just
to see the prices and their policies.

Please use common sense when scamming a product.  Don't ask for a free
business sample of a 4 gig. hard drive.  Do you know how much those cost?
I don't think any sane person would give that out even if you agreed to
buy 10 more in the next month.  WARNING: You may also need to tell the
sales lady what you are going to use this for.  Sometimes they get noisy
and ask what are you going to use this for just to satisfy their curiosity.
In other words have some more bullshit about you and your company ready to
give her. (pinguino- the unexpected questions and conversation is what makes
this sort of thing interesting)

Here is the way a normal conversation would go with a call to Mouser
Electronics:

Op: Thank you for calling Mouser Electronics. How may I help you?
Me: Hello.  Do you give out free business samples?
(Some sales people or Ops won't know what you are talking about so you
might have to explain it to them)
Op: Yes we do. What is the name of your company?
(They will usally ask this first before asking the product.  This is so
that they can run a check on the name.)
Me: Roberts Antique Radio Shop
Op: Okay and the address sir
Me: 1600 Phreak St.  Phreaksville, MI
Op: And your name sir
Me: George Roberts, I'm the owner of the store.
Op: Okay. What product?
Me: Do you sell 6.5536 Microprocessor Crytals?
Op: Yes we do sir.  Is that what you want?
Me: Yes and can you make it the non-surface mount kind?  These crystals
have to go in an Antique Radio.
Op: Okay. One last thing your phone number. I need this so that I can call
and see if you will be buying our product.
Me: 301-555-1212
(With Mouser, the Op may put you on hold and call up the number. This does
not happen all the time. It has only happened to me twice out of the
three things I have scammed from Mouser. My advice is to make it the front
desk of some large office building. Then if they call it they will get a
lady saying "What extension?". It is best to do this after the phone
number you gave the Op is closed so that the number will keep ringing or
give her a recording)
Op: Umm. Sir that number is coming up as Blah Blah Office buliding.
Me: That is where our  main office is located.
Op: Okay sir that will be shipped out immeditaly.  You should receive it in
two days.
(Untrue. It will arrive in two days)
Me: Thanks
Op: Thank you for calling Mouser Electronics

That is how it usually goes.  Be creative.  Find another place
where you can get something else. The most expensive product I have
scammed is a $19.00 mouse for my computer. My friend has scammed a
complete library of Novell books. Any questions or comments e-mail me at
the address at the top of this article.

                         More Fun With OCI
                 by Wiretapp (wiretapp@juno.com)
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
Remember the good old days when OCI would place a collect call for you to
your loop, conference, or forwarded number? Well, it appears that even the
world's most pathetic excuse for a phone company finally caught on to our
little scam. Since there seems to be so much confusion regarding OCI, let
me clear a few things up (for all who are interested):

OCI is owned by Wiltel, a subsidiary of Worldcom. Wiltel has two separate
sets of operators: retards and nice curtious operators. If you don't
subscribe to Wiltel, or access them through their 800-288-2880 number,
you get the retards.  Wiltel's Equal Access dialing code is 10555. If you
dial 105550 from home you will be greeted with an automated system much like
the one you used to be able to get by entering a phone number after the
dialtone of OCI's 800 number.

There are two major differences.  First off, they may not have ANI, but
(Pinguino: You sure about that?? I heard they added ANI.. someone verify)
they sure as hell have ONI (Operator Number Identification). Hence, anyone
calling through a 0+ method will have their number appear on the OCI screen.
Obviously, this is not the best access method for placing untraceable calls.

Secondly, the operators answer "Wiltel" this is simply because their
computer tells them too (brainwashed idiots!)

Wondering about the nice Wiltel operators? You may not believe this, but
Wiltel serves about half of nation's Fortune 500 companies, and if you
spend a huge amount per month, they have incredibly good rates (comparatively
speaking of course). If you have a long distance company on your home
phone that buys it's long distance from Wiltel (like TTI National), you
may get the nice operators. You also get a much better automated system, with the
option to place a collect call in spanish.

After much scamming and bullshitting the OCI operators, I finally managed
to figure out what the hell they mean when they tell you they "can't place
the call with the access method you have used." This is a bullshit line to
tell you that the number you gave them was a fraud, that there is no OCI
payphone with the number you gave them.  Now, you can either travel all
over like a blathering idiot looking for OCI phones - OR - you can simple
follow these simple instructions:

You: dial 1-800-288-2880
OCI: bong......
You: dial 0
OCI: One moment for the OCI operator
OCI: OCI, this is Kevin, how may I help you place a call please?
(Note, this is an actual QUOTE, notice the grammar!)
You: I'd like to place a collect call
OCI: May I have the area code and number on the phone you're using?
You: Humm, there doesn's seem to be any number on this payphone.
OCI: Are your sure?
You: Yes!  (they usually won't even ask if you're sure)
OCI: Alright, may I have the city and state you're calling from please?
You: (Pick a nice big metro area where they'll be LOTS of OCI phones)
OCI: (Typing). . . And may I have the area code and number you are calling?
You: Yes, it's XXX-XXX-XXXX
OCI: And your name?
You: Chris T.
OCI: Thank you for using OCI.  One moment please.

And what do ya know? The call goes through! Their computer assumes you
are calling from a valid OCI phone in that city and state.

Locations that worked for me: Manhattan (NY, NY), Los Angeles, and Chicago

Please note that there is a failure rate, so don't be discouraged. It
doesn't work about 1 in 4 times for me.
(Pinguino: Why doesn't it work..? Also.. a while back Logic/Sysfail declared
war on OCI.. find out as much as you can about them and we'll print it here
every month. Don't stop calling them, stay creative, and don't do stupid
stuff that will lead to you getting caught!)

                             Yahoo Hacked
            by Saint Skully the Dazed (skully@clipper.net)
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
On December 8th, 1997, Yahoo was hacked.  The main page was taken out and
replaced by one made by a group calling themselves P4NTZ and H4GiS. The hack
occurred about 7:00 PM PST and was only seen if you used lynx and went to
http://www1.yahoo.com. Officially, Yahoo claims it was caught by their
monitoring software, although I was able to view it until at least 11:00PM
PST.

Apparently, the page was hacked via a dialup behind Yahoo's firewall, not
via the internet.

(editorial mode="on")
I seriously doubt that what Yahoo officially claims is true. They claim it
was back to normal at 7:15PM, yet I and many others were able to view it
for several hours. It didn't get fixed until after a couple friends of mine
(Hi BPIsles and Runt!!!!!) started calling Yahoo and their parent company.
Personally, I wonder how long it woulda lasted had Yahoo not been called.

We got this anonymously from a PLA fan.. kinda interesting. I guess if you're

'Phone Sex' Bandit Given 1 Year in Jail
Associated Press

ENFIELD CONNECTICUT: Thomas Roche III stole cordless phones from homes in his
neighborhood and made more than $6,000 worth of phone sex calls because he
was lonely. At his sentancing Wednesday in Enfield Superior Court, Roche said
he realized what he did was wrong. "I made my problems their problems", said
Roche, 37, of Windsor Locks. He was sentanced to one year in prison. Police
arrested him in September 1996, after they caught him running through his
back yard and several other yards. He pleaded guilty this September to 10
counts of third-degree burglarly.
