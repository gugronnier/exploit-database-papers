        This week's letter from Angel of Death:

   Okay, Dr. Menace is going to be out of town for a while, so
   I'll be handling this solo, (just in case you're wondering why
   he isn't writing).  Writing aBBa has been really great so far,
   and we hope to continue the effort.  Right now, I would like a
   moment of silence for "Low Life", who was reportedly kicked
   off the Awakening BBS (206)582-5579 for uploading an issue of
   aBBa there.  Way to go Low Life!  We hope that if you have had
   any similar experiences, you should tell us about them, and
   PLEASE submit some articles.

  Title: Light Bulb Bomb
   Date: 12/19/1993


----------------------------------------

  Ever wanted to really scare somebody bad enough to make them
  pee their pants?  This bomb will do it.  Here's what you need:

  A light bulb
  A drill
  Some gunpowder
  Some duct tape
  A funnel

  In case you haven't figured it out already, here's how it
  works:  Take your lightbulb and your drill.  Drill a hole VERY
  CAREFULLY in the end of the lightbulb, without breaking the
  glass.  Then, get out your funnel and gunpowder.  Pour the
  gunpowder through the hole in the lightbulb.  Don't fill it up
  all the way, if you do you'll probably kill somebody.  Once
  there's enough gunpowder inside, put the duct tape over the
  hole so it doesn't escape.  Now, take the bomb to your victim's
  house, and replace one of their lightbulbs with this one.  When
  they switch on the light, the lightbulb will explode, blowing
  apart their light fixture, and sending them into cardiac
  arrest.  What a lark!

  For those of you with quick minds, the lightbulb bomb (or
  something similar) can be hooked up to any device that sends an
  electrical impulse, such as a car's spark plug, alarm clock,
  VCR timer, etc.  My personal favorite is taking apart a remote
  controlled toy car, and hooking the bomb up to the wire that
  powers the front wheels.  You can blow stuff up from a safe
  distance away, and no one will know.

  Title: Your favorite
   Date: 12/19/1993

    Okay folks, I don't know a particular lot about drugs, so I'm
    asking you guys to send in your personal favorite (legal)
    highs.  I'll make a compilation of everything I receive and
    send it out again next week.  Help me out!

  Title: Introduction to VAX hacking
   Date: 12/18/1993

     Okay, maybe you've heard of DEC's (Digital Equipment
     Corporation) VAX or VMS system.  You'll find these buggers
     scattered here and there on the Internet, but they're mostly
     non-networked machines used by banks and stuff, that you can
     reach over the telephone.  So, just in case you run across
     one, you'll know what to do.  For starters, I'll define some
     terms:

     VAX:  An acronym for Virtual Address eXtension.  A VAX
     computer uses memory addresses beyond the hardware's actual
     limits, so it can handle porgrams too large to fit in
     physical memory.  These machines range from desktop models,
     to huge VAX supercomputers.
     VMS:  An acronym for Virtual Memory System, also developed
     by DEC.  This is very similar to other operating systems,
     and was designed for business and engineering.

     DCL:  Digital Command Language.  This is rather like a DOS
     batch file, or a UNIX shell script, only running under VMS.
     If you are not currently executing a DCL (also called COM
     file), then you are entering commands into the DCL
     interpreter, similar to a prompt in UNIX or DOS.

     You can tell when you have reached a VAX system, becuase,
     usually after some introductory message, you will see the
     "Username:" and "Password:" prompts.

     To wrap this up, I'll give you a list of default VAX logins
     that come with the software.  The sysop is supposed to
     delete this when he buys the software, but stupid people
     aren't too tough to find.

            USERNAME              PASSWORD
            --------              --------
            DECNET                DECNET
       *    SYSTEST               UETP
                                  SYSTEST
            SYSTEM                SYSTEM
            DEFAULT               DEFAULT
       *    FIELD                 FIELD
            OPERATIONS            OPERATIONS
       *    SUPPORT               SUPPORT
                                  DEC
            SYSTEST_CLIG          CLIG
                                  SYSTEST
                                  TEST

Appendix A - aBBa BBS list Information

  If you run a hacking related Bulleting Board System, perhaps
  you would like to publicize your system to the right crowd.  If
  so, callthe Escapade Macabre, and leave a message to Dr. Menace
  or Angel of Death, telling us the name, number, and NuP (if
  any) of your BBS.  Thanks!

 -==============-
  {Name}                          {Phone #}            {NuP}

The Escapade Macabre            206-565-0786            None

----------------------------------------

Appendix B - Submitting articles to aBBa

 If you have read aBBa, and like what you see, perhaps you'd be interested
 in being published in our fine magazine?

 If so call The Escapade Macabre and leave feedback to Dr. Menace (NOT
 Angel of Death.) that contains the body of the article, the author, the
 date, and the title.  Most articles will be accepted as long as they are
 of the appropriate genre.  Thanx!

----------------------------------------

Appendix C - Receiving copies of aBBa

 The best way to receive aBBa is of course by modem.  However this is not
 possible for all people, and we were at aBBa realize that.  Very soon,
 you will be able to send a couple bucks to our post office box and get
 very nice bound copies of the current aBBa issue.  (It looks real good,
 printed on a BubbleJet Printer with high quality paper, then carefully
 photocopied, and stapled.)

 At some point, we do plan on making a special hardcopy edition of aBBa,
 featuring bold, italics, and underlines, with different sized fonts,
 hand drawn pictures, and a magazine format (Like 2600 sorta.) and
 everything, but this is a long way off....
----------------------------------------

Appendix D - Contacting the Editors

 There are a few ways you can contact Angel of Death and I.  Here they
 are:

 1) BBS: The Escapade Macabre, (206)565-0786.  A WWiV BBS run by Dr.
 Menace and Angel of Death.  We can both be contacted their.

 2) Yaki-Net: If you are one of the few people who are on Yaki-Net, try
 E-Mailing Dr. Menace@2600, or Angel of Death@2600, from any Yaki-Net
 BBS.  Some Yaki-Net BBS's carry an aBBa discussion area, too.

 3) Internet: We can also be reached by InterNet!  Dr. Menace is
 drmenace@hebron.connected.com, and Angel of Death is
 craig@hebron.connected.com.  I (Dr. Menace) am also on the Telnet
 Citadel BBS's as Dr. Menace, and Angel of Death is also on them as Net
 Prowler.  FTP to ftp.eff.org...download abba1.txt.

 4) IRC: We will soon host a ?weekly? chat for 2-3 hours...probably on
 Fridays.  We do not have this totally worked out yet, but the channel
 name will be "aBBaChat"...

 Any form of E-Mail is acceptable for submitting articles, just make
 sure you make you include the author, and subject of the article.

 Also, submissions may be posted in the "aBBa Discussion" area of
 participating Yaki-Net BBS's.  (Please DO NOT post articles in the
 Hacking Discussion areas on Yaki-Net!!!)

Have fun guyz!
