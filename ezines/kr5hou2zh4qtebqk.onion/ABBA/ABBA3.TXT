        Letter from the head guys:

        Hey!  This is Dr. Menace and Angel of Death.  We're the guys in
        charge of all this bullshit.  We imagine you are no doubt thinking,
        "Oh god.  Another fly-by-night underground computer hacker
        magazine!"  Well, we actually have a purpose for this one.  Here's
        the story:

        One day Angel of Death and myself were sitting around.  We realized
        that "Hey, there are magazines on drugs, magazines on weapons,
        magazines on phreaking, and magazines on hacking, but no really
        wonderful compilations all of the above."  (Of course, I am para-
        phrasing.)

        So here is the fruits of our effort.  I hope ya like it.

========================================================================

        This month's letter from Dr. Menace:


         'Sup d00dz?  Well here we are...shit almost a month into
         aBBa... how ya liking it?  We're going to be making some
         changes as to specific subject matter in the next couple of
         months...make sure to stay tuned for that.

         Umm from the 14th of December to the 31st Angel of Death will
         be totally in charge of aBBa...I'm taking a 10 day vacation to
         Miami and a 4 day vacation to the Bahamas...very much looking
         forward to it!!!

   This months shout-outs go to: The Chief, and Phearless over at uXu,
         All of the X-LoD/H staph, the crew at Phrack, and a big thanx
         to the Chief for letting The Escapade Macabre distro uXu...

   later guys!  (Angel of Death is kinda square...and well...and hasn't
   been into hacking and stuff as long as I so cut him a little slack
   ok?  l8a.)

  Title: Sling
   Date: 12/10/93


----------------------------------------

        Sup dudez...The sling is a relatively good weapon that's
        cheap (Even free if you can manage to steal the supplies,
        which was the path I opted for.  What it does is fling
        things at people.  (Note it's a SLING, not a slingshot.)

        Supplies Needed:
        ----------------

        Around 3' of rope.
        A 6" by 4" piece of cloth.


        (Yes, that's all!)

        First take the cloth.  You will need to cut holes in each
        corner of the cloth, like this:

             _____________________________________
            |                                     |
            | O                                 O |
            |                                     |
            |                                     |
            |                                     |
            | O                                 O |
            |_____________________________________|

       Alright, now take the length of rope and cut it in half.
       now the ends where you cut the rope should fray into
       around 4 parts.  Now tie the frayed rope sections through
       the holes in the cloth so that you have a piece of cloth
       with pieces of rope coming off of each side like this:

                        ___________________
   ------------------==+=.               .=+==------------------
   ------------------==+=.               .=+==------------------
                       |___________________|


       Now pick up a an end of the rope in each hand, with the cloth
       hanging at the bottom.  You should have a little pouch formed
       by the cloth, than you can put something in, such as a rock.

    Using the sling:
    -==============-

         This is kind of difficult to get the hang of, but extremely
         powerful and graceful once you do.  (It's great for tossing
         contact explosives long distances.)  What you do is put
         something like a rock or whatever in the pouch, and hold
         one end of the rope in your pinky and ring finger, and the
         other end between your middle and index finger.  Now spin
         the sling above your head very fast and let go of the end
         between your index and middle finger, and the projectile
         should fly out very fast and far!

have phun.

  Title: Blow-Gun (And darts.)
   Date: 12/09/93


----------------------------------------

        You've probably seen those ninja movies where
        the guys take a piece of bamboo and a rose
        thorn and blow it at someone and it flies at
        there neck, pierces there jugglar vein, killing
        them without any noise whatsoever.  Well this is
        not totally accurate, as it ain't that simple, but
        you too can do that!

        Supplies Needed:
        ----------------

        Several strands of yarn (Around 1.5" long each.)

        A pencil.

        A 2 1/4" long needle, beaded at the base.  If that's not
        available just tape the base.

        2-3 1/4' long pipe.  (PVC or Alluminum.) 1/2" in diameter.


        Making the Darts:
        -----------------

        Carefully twist off the metal part (The eraser too, duh.)
        THen take the pin and start putting 5-7 yarn strands on it.
        Then push them up through the hollow part of the head where the
        pencil was.  That should make a decent dart.  See diagram:
               #####
          >>>>>-----/  #  is the yarn
                       >  is the head of the pencil
                       -  is the pin
                       /  is the head of the pin (The sharp end.)

        Usage:
        ------

        Take the finished dart and stick it in the tube.  (If it's too
        small then put more yarn on, duh.)  Aim the tube at your dad's
        ass or something.  Blow very hard on the pipe.  Watch as the
        dart flies out and sticks into something!  Some of the pipes
        will have been cut in such a way that they are sharp, when this
        is so wrap it with black electrician's tape, that should fix it!
        (Toilet paper and scotch tape provides a cheaper solution too.)

  Title: Yum-Yum Biscuits
   Date: 12/09/93


----------------------------------------

           Hey guys...this is probably going to be the most silly
           recipe we have yet...but I couldn't resist but put it
           in...

      Supplies Needed:
      -==============-

      1 full tin of nutmeg
      20 teaspoons of sugar.  (Yes TWENTY.)
      3 1/2 slices of bread
      3 tablespoons of flower.
      1 oz. of Vanilla extract.
      2 cups of milk.
      5 pinches of caffeine.  (Or ground coffee beans.)

           Now take the crust off the bread, and put all this
           shit in a LARGE bowl.  Mix it very thoroughly.

           (And I mean VERY THOROUGHLY.)  You should get a
           nasty cold sweet smelling porridge.  Well take
           this and roll it into little balls, about 1/4th
           the size of the palm of your hand.  Nuke these
           in the microwave (If you don't have one, fucking
           get with it lamer!) for about 20 seconds, flip 'em
           over, and nuke 'em for 30 seconds.  Now pick each
           biscuit up, and squeeze out the moisture into the
           sink.  Now nuke them all for 15 seconds, flip
           over again and nuke for 10 seconds.  Wrap them
           all thoroughly and paper towels and let dry for
           2 hours.  When they're done eat them and have a spatula
           ready to peel yourself off of the fucking wall!

     What it does:
     ---- -- -----
             The sugar gets you buzzed almost instantly, and
             that gives the caffeine will then have time to
             get going and speed up the nutmeg which should
             fucking get you very high.

           Don't take that nutmeg shit lightly.  Low-funded jails
           have been found to use it to reform cocaine addicts.
           Too much of it will give you a cardiac arrest and kill
           you, so watch it.

        You know those fucking UGLY, worthless, STUPID shrubs your
        mother grows outside of your house?

        Well they do actually serve a practical, or impractical
        depending on your opinion (huh?) purpose.

       Well these shrubs are techinically known as Hydrangea paniculata
       grandiflora, of the saxifragaceae family.  And the cool thing is
       they contain rather noticable amounts of hydrangin, saponin and
       cyanogenic which have about the effect of marijuana.

        What you do is dry them in the sun (Get one of those things that
        those wussy vegetarians you see in Seattle uses to dry home
        grown spices in.) and crush them extremely well.

        Then simply roll them into cigarettes.  It'll get you high for
        about 2 hours.  Careful though only use 1 cigarette, otherwise
        you could get too much cyanide in your system, and then...well
        ya know....

        If you don't have any growing outside, give the people at your
        local nursery (Make sure no cool people see you walking in
        there!) the scientific name and they'll be happy to supply you
        with some!!!!!!!

            The rock box is a nice device that will channel music
            from your stereo or walkman or whatever strait into
            a fone...I know it doesn't serve much of any malicious
            intent but I had wanted one for so long I couldn't help
            but to put it in here.

            You will notice the sound quality is not too wonerful.
            Well this is not the fault of the box, and in fact there
            isn't much that can be done with it.  The truth is that even
            though telefone lines were MADE to carry voices etc., they
            don't do a very good job of it.  Here's the plans:

  Title: The Mauve Box
   Date: 12/11/93


----------------------------------------

Okay, I have not acutally tried making this box, it seems rather
silly to me, so don't blame me if it doesn't work.  I am somewhat
skeptical about this one, but I've added it to my list of
projects for Christmas break, I'll report back if it works.

Here's what you'll need to build an indirect tap:

2 tupperware or similar 8oz containers
1 small bag earth (dirt) (12oz) (Ash tray sand reportedly works better)
1 pint water
2 lantern batteries
1 nine volt battery
1 battery clip
2 SPST switches
4 ounces of iron shavings
2 polar magnets
5 feet wire
1 set soldering equipment (epoxy can work too)

Okay, try and follow this here:  Take your two tupperware
containers, and fill them with an even mixture of dirt and iron
shavings.  Cut the red and green wires, and splice the switches
in.  From the switches, you then need to solder the wire to the
magnets.  Connect the red to the positive end of the magnet, and
the green wire to the negative side of the OTHER magnet.  From
the other ends of both magnets, solder wires to the batteries &
the clip.  Set the nine-volt battery between the two tupperware
containers and stick the battery end of both magnets into the
tupperware.  Then, connect wire to the two ploes of the lantern
battery, and place them in the same containers as the ploes of
the magnets and the 9-volt battery.  Here's the weird part: add
some water to the two pots (without electrocuting yourself), and
let them sit in the sun until they bake like bricks.

How this thing is suppoesed to work:

The red and green wires are in a magnetic field which is being
charged continually by the lantern battery.  (Didn't you ever
watch Mr. Wizard?) This will supposedly "pull in" the nearest
phone conversation (skeptical).  When the 9V battery is
connected, the thing creates enough current for the poles of the
magnet to reverse themselves.  Now, you have a phone transmitting
to one or more phones in the near vicinity.  It's like a phone
tap, but legal.  You can do basically all the same things that
you can with a phone tap.
NOTE: Don't try this in a large apartment building or dormitory.

Appendix A - aBBa BBS List Information.

 If run a hacker related Bulletin Board System, perhaps you would like
 to publicize your board to the appropriate crowd.  If so, call The
 Escapade Macabre and leave feedback to Dr. Menace or Angel of Death
 telling us the name, number and NuP (if any) of your BBS.  Thanx!

Appendix B - Submitting articles to aBBa

 If you have read aBBa, and like what you see, perhaps you'd be interested
 in being published in our fine magazine?

 If so call The Escapade Macabre and leave feedback to Dr. Menace (NOT
 Angel of Death.) that contains the body of the article, the author, the
 date, and the title.  Most articles will be accepted as long as they are

----------------------------------------

Appendix C - Receiving copies of aBBa

 The best way to receive aBBa is of course by modem.  However this is not
 possible for all people, and we were at aBBa realize that.  Very soon,
 you will be able to send a couple bucks to our post office box and get
 very nice bound copies of the current aBBa issue.  (It looks real good,
 printed on a BubbleJet Printer with high quality paper, then carefully
 photocopied, and stapled.)

 At some point, we do plan on making a special hardcopy edition of aBBa,
 featuring bold, italics, and underlines, with different sized fonts,
 hand drawn pictures, and a magazine format (Like 2600 sorta.) and
 everything, but this is a long way off....
----------------------------------------
