        Letter from the head guys:

        Hey!  This is Dr. Menace and Angel of Death.  We're the guys in
        charge of all this bullshit.  We imagine you are no doubt thinking,
        "Oh god.  Another fly-by-night underground computer hacker
        magazine!"  Well, we actually have a purpose for this one.  Here's
        the story:

        One day Angel of Death and myself were sitting around.  We realized
        that "Hey, there are magazines on drugs, magazines on weapons,
        magazines on phreaking, and magazines on hacking, but no really
        wonderful compilations all of the above."  (Of course, I am para-
        phrasing.)

        So here is the fruits of our effort.  I hope ya like it.

========================================================================

        This month's letter from Angel of Death:

  Okay folks, some of you might have noticed that reading aBBa can make
  you very unpopular in some circles, and lots of people want to shut us
  up.  WE DON'T CARE.  This is a free press, we have our First Amendment
  rights, and we can say whatever we want.  Besides, Dr. Menace is the
  one responsible for this, I did nothing.  As a matter of fact, we
  would be THRILLED if you would distribute aBBa everywhere you can, and
  WRITE IN TO US!!  This time, we would like to hear about your
  (mis)adventures distributing aBBa, and/or other textfiles.  Do people
  try to shut you up, censor you, or kick you out?  Tell us about it!
  We want to know!  We want to tell EVERYBODY!  Get those
  unconstitutional pigs out of here!

  Title: Poor Man's Napalm
   Date: 12/3/93


----------------------------------------

               Alright guys.  You've seen the movie Apocalypse Now
         right????

         Well you know that part where that crazy phucker says how
         he loves the smell of Napalm??  I suppose you were watching
         those forests burn and those helpless natives running out
         of there smoldering grass huts and saying "HOLY SHIT!!  We
         gotta try that."

         Well you see Napalm is this very interesting substance that
         you can dump all over stuff, then light it and it will burn
         for quite some time, fucking TRASHING anything it gets on.

    So I suppose your curiosity is aroused?  Ok here's watcha gotta
    have:

       3 parts gasoline or isopropyl rubbing alchohol (Gasoline
       reccomended.)

       2 parts flour.  (YES FUCKING FLOUR, seriously.)

       1 part black powder.


        Ok now mix all this junk together.  With any FUCKING luck
        you'll get a nasty, bad smelling gunky mush.

        Well try dumping this all over the driveway of your house.
        Watch as the gasoline or whatever burns, but slowly because
        the flower slows it down.  The cool thing is the black powder
        will give off a ton of smoke.  How you ignite it is your
        business.

  Title: Tennis-Ball Cannon
   Date: 12/2/93


----------------------------------------


             Hey.....you no doubt have heard rumors about this
        around the 4th of July or what have you.....or maybe
        the kids (Or adults, as the case may be.) at school talk
        about them...the INFAMOUS (Ha!) Tennis Ball Cannon!


        Well the making of this is fairly simple but takes a while.

        (And of course this one has that aBBa touch that makes it
        deadly.....boy...we're really making ourselves threats to
        society 'eh??  We ought to be drug out into the streets and
        shot.)

        Ok anyways, take 6 tin cans.  Take the tops and bottoms out
        of all of them using a can opener (DUH.) except for one.

        Now, take them and slam them all together so it forms a tube
        that's open at one end, and closed at the other like this:

    Opened                                       Closed
          \     ___________________________     /
           --> ()__________________________) <--



        The cans should each over lap the cans next to them by at
        least half an inch.  Now DUCT TAPE THE FUCKING SHIT out
        of the places where the cans meet.  I cannot emphasize this
        enough!!!!!

        Alright so now you have a tennis ball cannon.  So what?

        What you do is take some gunpowder, how much is up to you
        and you have to kind of experiment.  Well after you put
        the gun powder in you put in the ball.  But not just any
        tennis ball, for a tennis ball by itself wouldn't do much,
        if any damage!!!!


        What you do is cut a tennis ball in half.  Fill it with
        with gun powder or blackpowder, at least 1/3 of the way.
        (Taking into consideration that the more weight the ball
        has, the more gunpowder will be needed to launch it.)

        Then use that handy old duct tape to put the ball back
        together again.  Then use the Napalm recipe mentioned
        above to coat the ball.  Then you spray some aerosol
        hair spray on there, like that cheap aquanet bull-
        shit.  Light it where the hair spray is then toss it into
        the cannon.  Get the FUCK away from there immediately.

        If you didn't fuck something up, a flaming ball
        should have shot out (As the flaming ball would ignite
        the gunpowder.) the end of the cannon and landed on something,
        lighting on fire whatever it came in contact with, then
        blowing up.


   Other ideas:  Try stuffing it with gravel, broken glass, thumb
                tacks or ball bearings.  They're great for taking
                out cars, by taking the cannon and blasting a shitload
                of thumbtacks in front of a car, phucking up it's
                tires.

              You know those ugly garden shrubs that your mom,
        and every mom in the FUCKING world grows in the garden?

        You know how those worthless fucking plants tend to trap
        the newspapers and you have to go weeding through them to
        find the newspaper and read the comics?


        Well believe it or not, they do serve a relatively use-
        ful purpose....


     Take the leaves.  Dry them...I do not recommend you use unnatural
     means for this, i.e. - dry them in the sun or whatever.


     After you dry them use your mortar and pestle (Which every good
     drugsmith should have!) and crush them into a very fine powder.

     Roll the resulting powder into regular cigarette paper, don't use
     any fancy shit like dollar bills like some fuckers do or you can
     get fucked up.  (And besides, burning money is AGAINST THE LAW!
     And we can't have that.)

     Then smoke it.  Notice I said it.  Smoke one.  At the ABSO-FUCKING-
     LUTE maximum smoke two.  Watch it though too much can produce
     cyanide that your system can't handle.



       If you are lacking a garden, you can pick one up at your local
       nursery, or steal the shit from an arboretum.  The plant shop
       at your local Ernst should have lots of plants.

 Have phun....

  Title: Beige Box (haha.)
   Date: 12/3/93


----------------------------------------


       Ok if any of you are so FUCKING LAME as to have not heard
       of the beige box, here's the gist:

       You've seen a lineman's handset before right???  It's like
       you see those lamer phone company dudes walk around with
       those phucked up phones and they clip it on a line with
       alligator clips right?  Then they can call places.  The
       thing is you can hook this up wherever you want!!!  Here's
       what you do:

    Take a cord that goes to your telephone handset.  The handset
    has to be the type that has the dialing buttons right on it.

    Now cut the cord.  You then should see a bunch of wires, and the
    ones that are important are the red and the green.  Then, get two
    alligator clips.  Hook one alligator clip to the red, and one clip to the
    green.  Then use a marker or something to make the clips red and
    green, respectively.  Congratulations, you've now got your very own
    beige box.  Be proud.  The best use for this is to go into someone's
    backyard, open up their little phone box, and hook your wires in
    there, to make all the phreaking calls you need.  The possibilities
    are endless, 900 numbers, hacking, prank calls, long distance, etc.

  Title: Phasor (Pandora's box)
  Date: 12/3/93


----------------------------------------

Have you ever wanted to REALLY annoy someone?  This box is really just a
"harmless prank", but I sure wouldn't want to have it used on ME.
Maybe you've heard of a phasor.  A phasor uses high-intensity sounds to
produce pain, by vibrating the bones of the inner ear.  What fun.
You might want to hook this set up to a $13 tweeter speaker, it will
improve things TRMENDOUSLY.  Here's what you're gonna need:

   1> One 555 Timer
   2> One .01 MFD capacitator
   3> One 100k variable resistor
   4> One tweeter speaker
   5> one 9v battery (the weird looking ones)
   6> some wire

All of this stuff is really easy to find (or so I've been told), but you
can change 2 and 3 slightly if you absolutely HAVE to.


Here's the blueprints for you:

I                    I PANDORA'S BOX I
+--------------------+---------------+

See how it works?  I didn't think so.  Maybe this will help:

 |
 | OR ---  =  WIRE VERTICAL/HORIZONTAL.
 |

  +        =  SHOWS WHERE TWO WIRES CROSS OVER EACH OTHER BUT DON'T TOUCH.

  *        =  SHOWS WHERE TWO OR MORE WIRES ARE CONNECTED TOGETHER.

\

I )-
I I        =  TWEETER
I )-
I/
/


Okay, pin 1 of the 555 is the pin next to a small dot on top of the
chip.  As a matter of fact, variable resistors ALWAYS have three leads,
but this circuit only requires two, so just connect one wire to either
of the outer leads, okay?

Since there's a pretty decent chance that your circuit got screwed if
this was your first time, heres a pin by pin reading (it's short):

  1. Pin 1 is connected to the 9V, one lead of the tweeter, and one end
  of the capicator
  2. Pin 2 is connected to pin 6 and the other end of the capicitator
  3. pin 3 is not connected to the other lead of the tweeter, and to
  just one lead of the variable resistor
  4. pin 4 is connected to pin 8
  5. pin 5 isn't connected at all!!!
  6. pin 6 is connected to pin 2 and the other lead of the variable
  resistor
  7. pin 7 isn't connected either
  8. pin 8 is connected to the 9V and to pin 4

Understand?  To test it out:  use the variable resistor to adjust the
pitch to just above what you can hear, you might notice a slight buzzing
or pain in your neck, ears, or sinuses.  That means it works.  Those of
you with sick minds probably already have ideas worked out.

Enjoy!

Appendix C - Receiving copies of aBBa

 The best way to receive aBBa is of course by modem.  However this is not
 possible for all people, and we were at aBBa realize that.  Very soon,
 you will be able to send a couple bucks to our post office box and get
 very nice bound copies of the current aBBa issue.  (It looks real good,
 printed on a BubbleJet Printer with high quality paper, then carefully
 photocopied, and stapled.)

 At some point, we do plan on making a special hardcopy edition of aBBa,
 featuring bold, italics, and underlines, with different sized fonts,
 hand drawn pictures, and a magazine format (Like 2600 sorta.) and
 everything, but this is a long way off....
----------------------------------------

Appendix D - Contacting the Editors

 There are a few ways you can contact Angel of Death and I.  Here they
