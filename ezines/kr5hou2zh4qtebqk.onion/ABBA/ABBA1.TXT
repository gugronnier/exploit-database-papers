        Letter from the head guys:

        Hey!  This is Dr. Menace and Angel of Death.  We're the guys in
        charge of all this bullshit.  We imagine you are no doubt thinking,
        "Oh god.  Another fly-by-night underground computer hacker
        magazine!"  Well, we actually have a purpose for this one.  Here's
        the story:

        One day Angel of Death and myself were sitting around.  We realized
        that "Hey, there are magazines on drugs, magazines on weapons,
        magazines on phreaking, and magazines on hacking, but no really
        wonderful compilations all of the above."  (Of course, I am para-
        phrasing.)

        So here is the fruits of our effort.  I hope ya like it.

========================================================================

        This month's letter from Dr. Menace:

Alright guys.

So this is it.

Finally.  What you've been waiting for.

The first issue of aBBa.

The anti Big Brother association.

Fighting for the freedom of all in the free world.

So uhhhh..huhuh pretty cool huh.

Well we finally got it out.  After a couple months of half-assed
planning, throwing ideas around, etc. etc. etc. we came out with
the most exciting new magazine on the anarchist's scene.

Hope ya enjoy it d00dz!

        Yo guys!  Does some guy at school phuck with you???  Do you want
        him to cut it out?  For GOOD???

        Well...here's a good chance.  A recipe for poison.

Supplies Needed:

        Horse Shit.  (A fair amount.)
        Human Blood.  (Must be of the type of the victim.)


        This poison is relatively simple.  First, get the horse shit.  You
        don't need a WHOLE LOT, and I don't suggest getting a whole lot cuz
        it stinks.


        Take the horse shit, and put it in a test tube, and put a rubber
        stopper on the end.  Use a very low flame on a bunson burner or
        what have you to melt the shit totally.

        Then this is the tricky part.  Separate all the chunks of hay and
        so forth from the shit.  ALL of it.  Trust me.


        Now you need human blood.  You'll need to have 3 times as much
        blood as you have shit, and it must be of the blood type of the
        person you attack!  If this is not at all possible (i.e. - You
        do not know...) then mix a little of all blood types into it, but
        this is not nearly as sure-fire.


        Mix the stuff together, and heat it at a VERY VERY low flame.
        Anything too hot will kill off the deadly bacteria!  Try not
        to smell the shit the fumes can kill you.


        Stir the shit while it's heating to mix it even better.  When
        the mix goes from red to brown or reddish-brown, let it cool.


        To like kill someone with this stuff, it needs to get into their
        bloodstream.  How?  Stay tuned for bow and blowgun instructions
        in the near future!

D.m.

  Title: LySergic Acid Dylithamite
   Date: 11/12/93


----------------------------------------


        Remember the 60's?  Probably not.  If not you missed out on something
        great, the era when just your average Joe Schmoe could easily go
        trip out on LSD and have a GOOD time.

        Well now you have to go through all this bullshit and find someone
        you can trust blah blah blah.  Well not anymore.  Do this and
        within a month you have a shitload of acid to do whatever the hell
        you want with. Eat it or sell it and get the money to get a fuckin'
        KICKIN' D.S.I. 19.2k v32Terbo softmodem!


Supplies needed:

        Glass pan about 1.5" thick.  The length is unimportant.
        1 box of coffee filters.
        Distilled (MUST BE DISTILLED!!!) water.
        A spoon.
        Rubbing alchohol.
        Hairspray.
        Rye grain.


        First cover the glass pan with the coffee filters, letting them drape
        over the sides.  Fill the pan with 1" of rye grain.  Soak it with the
        DISTILLED!  (If it's not distilled death may occur!!!) water.


        Then put something over the pan, covering it completely.  Stick it in
        a closet for a month.  After a month, take out the liquid from there.
        PURE LSD D00D!  It's not ready yet though.  For every pint you have,
        add 1 spoon of rubbing alchohol.  Let it sit for two days.  Then
        add it to the paper, and let it dry, and cover both sides of the
        paper(s) with 1 coat of hair spray.  For added potency add DMSO.  (A
        common chemical used as a paint thinner and an arthritis remedy.)


        If you do choose to use DMSO (Which is HIGHLY recommended.) then you
        should also add some caffeine tablets (No-Doz or whatever it doesn't
        matter.) because the shit will put you to sleep!


        Hope you have fun on this one guyz....later.

  Title: Reflection on the Old School
   Date: 11/25/93


----------------------------------------

        'Sup fellow phreakz.  Happy thanksgiving!!!

        Something has been a heavy weight on the brow of my colleagues
        and I for over a year now.

        Although the h/p world keeps growing rapidly, 'Zines start up
        every day, hundreds more 3til3 BBS's start every year, the
        scene is still deteriorating.

        Taking into consideration the afformentioned, my statement
        may seem kind of ridiculous.  Well let's just analyze this.

        First of all, there's the attitudes.  The same people that 5
        years ago were bragging about 20 or 30 meg drives will now
        deem anyone possessing less than 200 a total lamer.  And of
        course, I realize that a 200 is far favorable to a 20 or 30,
        but the point is the whole fucking scene has become so god
        damn materialistic.

        There are old farts (I'm saying this cuz most of the younger
        hackers I've met are pretty cool.  I'm talking about like
        the OLD dudes.) who call themselves hackers after they
        upload Syndicate or some shit somewhere.

        And then there are guys who go into the computer lab at their
        school and start deleting shit for no reason, and calling it
        hacking.  Then there are the people who call all computer
        afficianados hackers.  Well all of the above just isn't true.

        The first two don't require any skill, and the third...well
        the definition of 'hacking' has just changed, so face it
        people.  Definitions of words WILL change over time.

        Also there's the 'zines.  I remember stuff like BOOT, stuff
        that would have something to SAY when it was published.
        I mean a few phlames are no big deal, but I've seen 'zines
        with entire articles ragging on this or that group!  SHIT!

       Well anyways....I'd like to hear what you guys think about
       this.  please e-mail your opinions to
       drmenace@hebron.connected.com....later!
^L
----------------------------------------

        Special Section:
        -==============-

   Okay, since this is our first issue of aBBa, I'll start with a
very simple UNIX hack that even non-hackers and household plants
can understand.  For the uninitiated, I'll define a few terms
first:  UUCP stands for Unix-to-Unix-CoPy, and is a protocol for
transfering data (such as messages) from one system to another.
Telnet is a networking protocol used on all InterNet systems that
allows you to login to the specified system and port number from
remote.

This is how you exploit UUCP mail transfers:

Step 1:
Choose any Internet system to do your fake mail transfer from, it
doesn't matter which system you choose, you can specify a return
address later.  You can get these system names from message
headers, or other methods (you'll find more every day).  Then
type:

telnet [system address] 25

DON'T FORGET THE 25 AT THE END!!!  This specifies that you would
like to login to port 25, which is the standard UUCP mail port.

Step 2:
Once you have connected, type in the following:

rcpt to [destination address]
mail from [fake return address]
data

Step 3:
Once you have typed in "data", you will be prompted to enter your
message.  Once you have finished, type "." (without quotes) on a
blank line, then type "quit" to end the connection.

That's it!  If you can't seem to get it to work on your own, just
try this sample test:

telnet garbo.uwasa.fi 25
rcpt to craig@hebron.connected.com
mail from president@whitehouse.gov (Which BTW IS Clinton's address.)
data
Warning...
Hi craig!  Your IRS return is in the mail!
..
quit

Note: The first line of the message will be the subject!!!!! please
remember this.

That should work.
----------------------------------------
Appendix A - aBBa BBS List Information.

 If run a hacker related Bulletin Board System, perhaps you would like
 to publicize your board to the appropriate crowd.  If so, call The
 Escapade Macabre and leave feedback to Dr. Menace or Angel of Death
 telling us the name, number and NuP (if any) of your BBS.  Thanx!
 Sorry it's so small, it was a last minute idea.

  Current BBS List:
  -==============-
{Name}                          {Phone #}               {NuP}

The Escapade Macabre            206-565-0786            None

----------------------------------------

Appendix B - Submitting articles to aBBa

 If you have read aBBa, and like what you see, perhaps you'd be interested
 in being published in our fine magazine?

 If so call The Escapade Macabre and leave feedback to Dr. Menace (NOT
 Angel of Death.) that contains the body of the article, the author, the
 date, and the title.  Most articles will be accepted as long as they are
 of the appropriate genre.  Thanx!

----------------------------------------

Appendix C - Receiving copies of aBBa

 The best way to receive aBBa is of course by modem.  However this is not
 possible for all people, and we were at aBBa realize that.  Very soon,
 you will be able to send a couple bucks to our post office box and get
 very nice bound copies of the current aBBa issue.  (It looks real good,
 printed on a BubbleJet Printer with high quality paper, then carefully
 photocopied, and stapled.)

 At some point, we do plan on making a special hardcopy edition of aBBa,
 featuring bold, italics, and underlines, with different sized fonts,
 hand drawn pictures, and a magazine format (Like 2600 sorta.) and
 everything, but this is a long way off....
----------------------------------------

Appendix D - Contacting the Editors

 There are a few ways you can contact Angel of Death and I.  Here they
 are:

 1) BBS: The Escapade Macabre, (206)565-0786.  A WWiV BBS run by Dr.
 Menace and Angel of Death.  We can both be contacted their.

 2) Yaki-Net: If you are one of the few people who are on Yaki-Net, try
 E-Mailing Dr. Menace@2600, or Angel of Death@2600, from any Yaki-Net
 BBS.  Some Yaki-Net BBS's carry an aBBa discussion area, too.

 3) Internet: We can also be reached by InterNet!  Dr. Menace is
 drmenace@hebron.connected.com, and Angel of Death is
 craig@hebron.connected.com.  I (Dr. Menace) am also on the Telnet
 Citadel BBS's as Dr. Menace, and Angel of Death is also on them as Net
 Prowler.  Also E-Mail Dr. Menace on any net for a copy of aBBa...

 4) IRC: We will soon host a ?weekly? chat for 2-3 hours...probably on
 Fridays.  We do not have this totally worked out yet, but the channel
 name will be "aBBaChat"...

 Any form of E-Mail is acceptable for submitting articles, just make
 sure you make you include the author, and subject of the article.

 Also, submissions may be posted in the "aBBa Discussion" area of
 participating Yaki-Net BBS's.  (Please DO NOT post articles in the
 Hacking Discussion areas on Yaki-Net!!!)

Have fun guyz!
