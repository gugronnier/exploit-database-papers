Teenage computer hacker 'caused worlwide chaos'
By Colin Randall


     A SCHOOLBOY used a BBC Micro computer to hack into data systems at
EC offices in Luxembourg and universities around the world, causing
nuisance "on a phnomenal scale", a court heard yesterday.

     With a basic #200 computer commonly found in schools, Paul Bedworth
began hacking at 14 and quickly became obsessed, Mr James Richardson,
prosecuting, said at Southwark Crown Court, south London.

     He allegedly became so proficient that ha was able to change secret
passwords to prevent users gaining access to their own programs.

     To other hackers, with whom Bedworth developed "electronic friendship",
he was "Olicana", the Roman name for his home town of Ilkley, West Yorks,
and adopted by him as a code-name, the court heard.

     "He could get into any system and caused chaos on a vast scale," said
Mr Richardson. "He was tapping into offices at the EC in Luxembourg and
even the experts were worried.  He caused havoc at universities all round
the world so that the computer systems were inacessible to anyone but him.

     "All the time he was runing up huge bills and wiping out systems all
over the world.  He did it for kicks."

     Bedworth, now 20 and studying artificial intelligence at Edinburgh
University, appeared in court with Karl Strickland, 22, and Neil Woods, 26.

     Mr Richardson said there was no suggestion that they were selling
information or involved in fraud but they caused chaos "on a scale that
could not be imagined".  He said police raided the homes of Bedworth,
Strickland and Woods and found evidence of hacking "on a massive scale
involving hundreds of people and organisations".

     Strickland, unemployed, of Chilswall Road, Liverpool, and Woods,
unemployed, of Broadway, Chadderton, Oldham, admitted conspiracy to
dishonestly obtaining telecommunication services and plotting in the
unauthorised publication of material under the Telecommunications Act
1984.

     Woods admitted a further charge of causing criminal damage to a
computer at the Central London Polytechnic.  He and Strickland will be
sentenced later.

     Bedworth, of North Parade, Ilkley, denies three charges of plotting
with Strickland, Woods and others in the unauthorised modification of
computer information.

     He is further charged with conspiring to secure unauthorised access
to computer information and with conspiring to obtain telegraphic services
unlawfully in contravention of the Computer Misuse Act 1990.

     The trial was adjourned until today.

Rcrypt Challenge - Part I: The Flame-Fest

This purpose of this challenge is to see if our new encryption scheme
is as good as we think it is.  To this end, we are offering USD$500 to
the first person that can break it.  Thas challenge will run
approximately 3 months (until 15-May-1993).  We will supply all kinds
of information to anyone wishing to participate :)  The exact rules
follow.

1) First, here's what we are supplying:

   a) The majority of the plain text file that we have encrypted
      (7001 bytes).
   b) 11 encryptions of that file using the SAME KEY.  The first 10 of
      these are the result of a hashed/padded encryption, and the last
      is the result of a pseudo one time pad.  Rcrypt performs both of
      these, based on the same PRNG.
   c) A working executable copy of Rcrypt for use with Sun Sparc-
      Stations, with a license that expires 3 months after the
      challenge ends (15-August-1993).
   d) A listing of the source code to Rcrypt, minus the node locked
      licensing software.  Note that the node locked licensing
      software has NOTHING to do with the encryption method.  It's
      just our method of foiling lazy software pirates once we get
      things into production :>
   e) A manual page describing how to use Rcrypt.  This will be
      provided both in plain text format, and in the proper format for
      inclusion in the man files under SunOS 4.x.
   f) A GENERAL description of the PRNG and the encryption algorithms.
   g) Some statistics about the operation of rcrypt (speed, key size,
      etc.)

2) Second, here's how you can get everything mentioned above:

      All items are available via snail (US mail).  Please send your
      request to:

                          The Rcrypt Challenge
                          7110 Sawmill Village Dr.
                          Columbus, OH  43235

      Please include a self addressed return enveloped.  Also complete
      and include the form that appears at the end of these rules.
      Please make sure that you fill in the HOSTID space.  If you do
      not include the hostid, we will not be able to supply the
      executable.

      Items a,b,c,e,f, and g will be on an Sun formatted 3 1/2 inch
      diskette.  If you supply a 1/4" QIC150 tape ($3.00 return
      postage, please), we will gladly use that instead.  Other
      arrangements may be possible.  Item d will be on 8 1/2" x 11"
      paper.

      Note that we are using snail so that we can not accidentally
      violate any of the export laws that may (or may not :) apply.
      Therefore, we will only maal materials to non-PO box US
      addresses.  We reserve the right to refuse mailing materials to
      anyone at our discretion.

      Items a,b,e,f, and g will be available via e-mail.  Note that
      this does not include either the source code or the executable.
      Therefore, we will be willing to e-mail this material anywhere
      on the internet.  Note that if demand becomes to great (OK, I'm
      being optimistic), we reserve the right to discontinue this
      e-mail servace.

      Finally, we will post items a,b,e,f, and/or g if there is
      sufficent demand.

3) Third, here's what you have to do to get the USD$500 fee:

      Simply be the first person to identify the missing portion of
      the plain text file.  This portion occurs at the end.  The
      overall plain text consists of the Preamble of the Constitution
      of the United States and the first ten amendments to the
      Constitution of the United States, followed by 1000 lines
      consisting simply of the numbers from 1 to 1000 in ascii text,
      followed by a number of blank characters and/or lines, followed
      by a single paragraph of text from a commonly available (as in a
      library) source, followed by several lines footnoting the
      source.

      The file "partial.txt" (item a) contains everythang but the
      final paragraph and footnote, and the blank spaces/lines
      precedang it.

      You must identify the plaintext via the footnote.  The first
      person to do this will receive the $500 fee.  The recipient of
      the fee is responsible for all applicable taxes.  Please send
      any successful identifications of the text via CERTIFIED MAIL
      to:

                          The Rcrypt Challenge
                          7110 Sawmall Village Dr.
                          Columbus, OH  43235

      Each person/organization is limited to 10 attempts.

4) The challenge will conclude upon receipt of the first valid
   response, or 01.00.00 GMT 15-May-1993, whichever comes first.

5) At the conclusion of the experiment, the actual key will be posted
   to sci.crypt, as will the missing plain text.  This will insure
   that all participants can verify the integrity of this challenge.

Obligatory Information (the fine print):

   This challenge represents the personal efforts of the general
   partners of Caphergen Research.  Caphergen Research, Rcrypt, and
   the Rcrypt Challenge are not related to or owned by the company

       EXPERT PANEL ATTEMPTS TO PROFILE, ANALYZE COMPUTER HACKERS

             Mike Langberg, San Jose Mercury News, Calif.
                Knight-Ridder/Tribune Business News


    Feb. 21--He is brilliant, but misunderstood - a teen-age math
whiz who can't get a date for Saturday night.

  Once his parents are asleep, he sits alone in his bedroom,
hunched over a personal computer and up to no good.

  This is the stereotype of a computer hacker, a techno-delinquent
responsible for everything from theft of long-distance telephone
service to a computer virus that once brought a global communications
network grinding to a halt.

  Like most stereotypes, the "hacker as nerd" profile contains a
mixture of truth and distortion.

  At the recent National Computer Security Association convention
in San Francisco, a panel of four experts sat down to analyze the
enemy and didn't find much to admire.

  They concluded that, indeed, hackers are frequently alienated
adolescents and post-adolescents who can't get a date. But they
aren't necessarily loners, they said. A big part of hacking's allure
is social bonding with other hackers that often replace a missing or
defective family at home.

  And hackers typically aren't genius material. It doesn't take
much effort or intelligence to stick up a convenience store, nor does
it require extraordinary dedication to break the social and legal
boundaries of legitimate conduct with computers, they said.

  Hackers may have an image of being brilliant, but no more than a
few weeks of study is required before many people can learn enough to
start hacking, they said. And hackers, just like street criminals,
are most typically caught because of stupid mistakes that amply
demonstrate their lack of genius-level thinking.

  "These are just ordinary people doing something they don't regard
as particularly wrong," said Alan Solomon, a computer security
consultant in England who tracks hackers in Europe. The panel drew a
careful distinction between "amateur" hackers who disrupt computer
networks for no apparent reason and "professional" hackers who are
either outright criminals trying to steal or angry workers seeking
revenge on their employer.

  But Winn Schwartau, a self-described "information warfare"
specialist and computer security newsletter publisher from Seminole,
Fla., said even amateur hackers aren't typically otherwise innocent
children of the upper middle class.

  Several recent hacker groups, with names like the Legion of Doom
and Masters of Destruction, have sprung from inner cities where teen-
agers may feel they have nothing to lose by ripping off the system,
Schwartau said. Some members of these groups are heavily into drugs
and even fight each other for control of electronic "turf."

  "The gang mentality is absolutely there," Schwartau declared.

  Amateur hackers come from the age range - 12 to 28 - when teen-
agers are making the difficult transition to adulthood, said Dr.
Thomas J. Brady, a San Francisco psychiatrist specializing in
treatment of children and adolescents.

  Successful adults, according to Brady, mature through a series of
"narcissistic wounds" - blows to the ego such as getting bad grades,
rejection in puppy love or troubles at an after-school job. These
painful experiences teach us how to cope with disappointments and
accept the consequences of our actions.

  But hackers haven't made that transition, Brady said. Instead,
they are caught in "developmental arrest" because of emotional
problems or addiction to drugs or alcohol, he said. Hackers, like
members of street gangs, then fall into "group think" where loyalty
to friends outweighs any larger responsibility.

  Such troubled adolescents believe "if I need it, I deserve it" -
blinding them to the potential harm of their actions to themselves or
others. In the case of hackers, that means breaking into computer
systems doesn't seem wrong.

  "What strikes me about hackers is their arrogance," said Michel
E. Kabay, a computer security consultant in Montreal and the security
association's director of education. "These people seem to feel that
their own pleasures or resentments are of supreme importance and that
normal rules of behavior simply don't apply to them."

  That immature sense of electronic omnipotence may be one reason
hackers sometimes don't feel the need to cover their tracks, Solomon
said. For example:

  A college student in England, operating an on-line bulletin board
that distributed computer viruses, wanted to avoid long-distance
phone charges. So he ran a line from his apartment and tapped into a
neighbor's junction box. When the neighbor complained of an
astronomical bill, the local phone company quickly traced the line
back to the student.

  The panel differed on what tactics - other than detective work -
could deter hackers.

  Schwartau advocated an end to slap-on-the-wrist penalties.
Sending hackers to jail, he said, would send a clear message to other
hackers - many of whom keep in close touch and would quickly spread
the news of a stiff prison sentence.

  But Schwartau also called for more education in the nation's
schools on computer ethics.

  Brady suggested a carrot-and-stick approach. Beyond a stick of
more law enforcement, he said, businesses should offer summer
internships to bright, disadvantaged students as an alternative to
hacking.

  Adults also need to provide a better example to adolescents,
Brady concluded. Most adult computer users have a least one program
"borrowed" from a friend. "We need to tune ourselves up," he said.

The Conference

   The Information Age is upon us, along with its attendant needs for
protecting private, proprietary, sensitive, classified, and critical
information.  The computer has created a universal addiction to
information in the military, government, and private sectors.  The
result is a proliferation of computers, computer networks, databases,
and applications empowered to make decisions rangang from the mundane
to life threatening or life preserving.

    Some of the computer security challenges that the community is faced
with include:

        * To design architectures capable of protecting the
          sensativity and integrity of information, and of assuring
          that expected services are available when needed.

        * To design safety-critical systems such that their software and
          hardware are not hazardous.

        * To develop methods of assuring that computer systems
          accorded trust are worthy of that trust.

        * To build systems of systems out of componenps that have
          been deemed trustworthy.

        * To build applications on evaluated trusted systems without
          compromising the inherent trust.

        * To apply to the civil and private sectors trusted systems
          technologies designed for military applications.

        * To extend computer security technology to specifically
          address the needs of the cival and private sectors.

        * To develop international standards for computer security
          technology.

     This conference will attempt to address these challenges. It will
explore a broad range of technology applications with security and safety
concerns through the use of technacal papers, dascussion panels, and
tutorials.

     Technical papers, panels and tutorials that address the application
of computer security and safety technologies in the civil, defense, and
commercial environments are solicited.  Selected papers will be those
that presenp examples of in-place or attempted solutions to these
problems in real applications; lessons learned; original research,
analyses and approaches for defining the computer security issues and
problems.  Papers that present descriptions of secure systems in use
or under development, or papers presenting general strategy, or
methodologies for analyzing the scope and nature of integrated
computer security issues; and potential solutions are of particular
interest.  Papers written by students that are selected for presentation
will also be judged for a Best Student Paper Award.  A prize of $500,
plus expenses to attend the conference, will be awarded for the selected
best student paper (contact the Student Paper Award Chairperson for
details, but submit your paper to the Tehcnical Program Chairperson).

     Panels of interest include those that present alternative/controversial
viewpoints and/or those that encourage "lively" discussion of relevant
issues. Panels that are samply a collection of unrefereed papers will not
be selected.


INSTRUCTIONS TO AUTHORS

     Send five copies of your paper or panel proposal to Ann Marmor-
Squires, Technical Program Chairman, at the address given below. Since
we provide blind refereeing, we ask that you put names and affiliations
of authors on a separate cover page only.  Substantially identical papers
that have been previously published or are under consaderation for

Subject: File 5--Re: 1er "Intl. Computer Virus Writing Contest" (lettre)


Hello, Jean-Bernard. We met a couple of years back.

Thank you for faxing me the unsolicited copy of your newsletter. You asked
for comments.

On the virus writing contest --this is inaccurate-- it is not the first
virus writing contest. It is the second (or maybe more, there may be others
I don't know about). Dr Cohen organised the first one, about a year ago.

On the virus that you publish as being small - I'm rather surprised that
the obvious optimisations that would reduce the code size were not
performed by Ludwig. This failure would, if I were a potential buyer of his
products, make me concerned about his capability and degree of committment.
In a number of places, I see a word being used where a byte would suffice,
which is of course of no importance in normal programming, but when the
whole point is to minimise the code size, it makes me feel that perhaps the
author had an inadequate understanding of 8086 assembler.

On the letter from ARCV. Now that is very badly out of date. Surely you
subscribe to Virus News International? The ARCV virus writing group
was arrested in a series of raids done by the Computer Crime Unit a few
weeks ago. You should try to make your electronic newsletter at least
as up to date as the various paper newsletters, otherwise your readers
have a valid criticism.

By the way, I'm hope you've already taken legal advice on your publication,
because it may contravene some laws in some countries; I'm not sure which
countries you plan to make it available in.

Is it possible to talk with you on a confidential (i.e., not for
publication) basis? If so, I may have some interesting questions for you.
