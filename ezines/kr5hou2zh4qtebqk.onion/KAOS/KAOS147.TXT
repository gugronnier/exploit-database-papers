                ___________________________________________
                    Initial Release - February 12, 1992
                ___________________________________________

     We, the members of PHALCON/SKISM, in order to form a more perfect
environment worldwide for the virus community, establish justice, ensure
intracommunity tranquility, provide for the common defense and offense,
promote the general welfare, and secure the blessings of liberty to
ourselves and our posterity, do ordain and establish this Constitution of
Worldwide Virus Writers.

ARTICLE I - REGARDING ORIGINAL VIRII
     Section A - DEFINITION
          The term "original virus" herein indicates programming done
          exclusively by either one individual or group, with no code
          taken from any other source, be it a book or another virus.
     Section B - CODE REQUIREMENTS
          For an original virus to conform to the standards set by
          this document, it must include the following:
            1) The title of the virus in square brackets followed by a
               zero byte should be in the code, in a form suitable for
               inclusion into SCAN(1).  This is to ensure that the
               name of the virus is known to those examining it.
            2) The name of the author and his/her group affilition/s
               should be included in the code, followed by a zero
               byte.  At the present, this is an optional requirement.
            3) Some form of encryption or other form of stealth
               techniques must be used.  Even a simple XOR routine
               will suffice.
            4) If the virus infects files, the code should be able to
               handle infection of read only files.
            5) It must have some feature to distinguish it from other
               virii.  Creativity is encouraged above all else.
            6) The virus must not be detectable by SCAN.
     Section C - IMPLEMENTATION
          This section, and all sections hereafter bearing the heading
          "IMPLEMENTATION" refer to the recommended method of
          implementation of the suggestions/requirements listed in the
          current article.
            1) Virus_Name db '[Avocado]',0
            2) Author     db 'Dark Angel, PHALCON/SKISM',0

ARTICLE II - REGARDING "HACKED" VIRII
     Section A - DEFINITION
          The term "hacked virus" herein refers to any virus written
          by either one individual or a group which includes code
          taken from any other source, be it a book, a code fragment,
          or the entire source code from another virus.
          The term "source virus" herein refers to the virus which
          spawned the "hacked virus."
     Section B - CODE REQUIREMENTS
          For a "hacked" virus to conform to the standards set forth
          by this document, it must include the following, in addition
          to all the requirements set down in Article I of this
          document:
            1) The title, author (if available), and affiliation of
               the author (if available) of the original virus.
            2) The author of the hacked virus must give the source
               code of said virus to the author of the source virus
               upon demand.
            3) No more Jerusalem, Burger, Vienna, Stoned, and Dark
               Avenger hacks are to be written.
            4) The source virus must be improved in some manner
               (generally in efficiency of speed or size).
            5) The hacked virus must significantly differ from the
               source virus, i.e. it cannot be simply a text change.
     Section C - IMPLEMENTATION
            1) Credit db 'Source stolen from Avocado by Dark Angel of
               PHALCON/SKISM',0

ARTICLE III - REGARDING VIRAL STRAINS
     Section A - DEFINITION
          The term "viral strain" herein refers to any virus written
          by the original author which does not significantly differ
          from the original.  It generally implies a shrinking in code
          size, although this is not required.
     Section B - CODE REQUIREMENTS
          For a "viral strain" to conform to the standards set by this
          document, it must include the following, in addition to all
          the requirements set down in Article I of this document:
            1) The name of the virus shall be denoted by the name of
               the original virus followed by a dash and the version
               letter.
            2) The name of the virus must not change from that of the
               original strain.
            3) A maximum of two strains of the virus can be written.
     Section C - IMPLEMENTATION
            1) Virus_Name db '[Avocado-B]',0

ARTICLE IV - DISTRIBUTION
     Section A - DEFINITION
          The term "distribution" herein refers to the transport of
          the virus through an infected file to the medium of storage
          of a third (unwitting) party.
     Section B - INFECTION MEDIUM
          The distributor shall infect a file with the virus before
          uploading.  Suggested files include:
            1) Newly released utility programs.
            2) "Hacked" versions of popular anti-viral software, i.e.
               the version number should be changed, but little else.
            3) Beta versions of any program.
          The infected file, which must actually do something useful,
          will then be uploaded to a board.  The following boards are
          fair game:
            1) PD Boards
            2) Lamer boards
            3) Boards where the sysop is a dick
          No virus shall ever be uploaded, especially by the author,
          directly to an antivirus board, such as HomeBase or
          Excalibur.
     Section C - BINARY AND SOURCE CODE AVAILABILITY
          The binary of the virus shall not be made available until at
          least two weeks after the initial (illicit) distribution of
          the virus.  Further, the source code, which need not be made
          available, cannot be released until the latest version of
          SCAN detects the virus.  The source code, should it be made
          available, should be written in English.
     Section D - DOCUMENTATION
          Documentation can be included with the archive containing
          the binary of the virus, although this is optional.  The
          author should include information about the virus suitable
          for inclusion in the header of VSUM(2).  A simple
          description will follow, though the author need not reveal
          any "hidden features" of the virus.  Note this serves two
          purposes:
            1) Enable others to effectively spread the virus without
               fear of self-infection.
            2) Ensure that your virus gets a proper listing in VSUM.

ARTICLE V - AMENDMENTS
     Section A - PROCEDURE
          To propose an amendment, you must first contact a
          PHALCON/SKISM member through one of our member boards.
          Leave a message to one of us explaining the proposed change.
          It will then be considered for inclusion.  A new copy of the
          Constitution will then be drafted and placed on member
          boards under the filename "PS-CONST.TXT" available for free
          download by all virus writers.  Additionally, an updated
          version of the constitution will be published periodically
          in 40HEX.
     Section B - AMENDMENTS
          None as of this writing.

ARTICLE VI - MISCELLANEOUS
     Section A - WHO YOU CAN MAKE FUN OF
          This is a list of people who, over the past few years, have
          proved themselves to be inept and open to ridicule.
            1) Ross M. Greenberg, author of FluShot+
            2) Patricia (What's VSUM?) Hoffman.
            2) People who post "I am infected by Jerusalem, what do I
               do?" or "I have 20 virii, let's trade!"
            3) People who don't know the difference between a virus
               and a trojan.
            4) Lamers and "microwares puppies"
     Section B - WHO YOU SHOULDN'T DIS TOO BADLY
          This is a list of people who, over the past few years, have
          proved themselves to be somewhat less inept and open to
          ridicule than most.
            1) John McAfee, nonauthor of SCAN
            2) Dennis, true author of SCAN
     Section C - MOTIVATION
          In most cases, the motivation for writing a virus should not
          be the pleasure of seeing someone else's system trashed, but
          to test one's programming abilities.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
PHALCON/SKISM Vengeance virus.                            Released  02/03/92
Stats: Non-Resident .COM infector.                        in 40Hex Vmag
       Infects files larger than 1992 bytes
       Size of the virus is about 722 bytes


Note: This Virus is dedicated to the memory of Digital Warfare BBS, which was
      online up until January 20th, 1992.  On that fateful day, the BBS
      computer was confiscated by local authorities. Hopefully the board will
      come back up, and be as good as before...

This virus activates the 20th of every month. Just for the fun of it, I'm not
going to tell you what this thing does upon activation. I will say one thing
unless you have suicidal tendencies, DON'T test it on your own machine, OR
the machine of someone you love.  It ain't pretty.  It IS destructive. (286+)
It IS noisy.  And it IS named appropriately.

Text that can be found in the virus:

                         *** Vengeance is ours! ***

                             PHALCON/SKISM '92

As of Scan 86, this virus isn't found.  Since it is based on the Violator
virus, other scanners may find it.  Oh well.

Have fun with this one, just don't run it on the 20th...  at least, not on
YOUR machine!

                HOW TO MODIFY A VIRUS SO SCAN WON'T CATCH IT
                                PART II


In Issue 1 of 40Hex, Hellraiser presented a simple (though incredibly
tedious) method of searching for scan strings.  In short, this was his
method:

  1) Make a small carrier file.
  2) Infect the carrier with the virus.
  3) Fill parts of the virus with a dummy value until you isolate the
     scan string.
  4) Modify the virus so it is not detectable, i.e. switch the order of
     the instructions.

The problem is, of course, that step 3 takes a maddeningly inordinate
amount of time.  I shall present a tip which will save you much time.
The trick is, of course, to find out where the encryption mechanism and
hence the unencrypted portion where the scan string is usually located.
Once the encryption mechanism is located, isolating the scan string is
much simpler.

Of course, the problem is finding the encryption mechanism in the first
place.  The simplest method of doing this is using V Communication's
Sourcer 486, or any similar dissassembler.  Dissassemble the file and
search for the unencrypted portions.  Most of the file will be DBs, so
search for any part which isn't.  Once you have located those parts, all
you have to do is subtract 100h from the memory location to find its
physical offset in the file.  You now have a general idea of where the
scan string is located, so perform step 3 until you find it.

Ack, you say, what if you don't have Sourcer?  Well, all is not lost.
Load up the infected carrier in good old DEBUG.  The first instruction
(in COM infections) should be a JMP.  Trace (T) into the JMP and you
should be thrown into the area around the encryption mechanism.  Use the
memory offset (relative to the PSP segment) and subtract 100h to find
the physical location of the unencrypted portion in the file.  Once
again, once you have this, perform step 3.  Simple, no?

Sometimes, SCAN looks for the writing portion of the code, which
generally calls INT 21h, function 40h.  This is usually, though not
always, located somewhere near the encryption mechanism.  If it is
not near there, all you have to do is trace through the virus until
it calls the write file function.

Another method of looking for scan codes is to break the infected carrier
file into a series of 50 byte overlapping chunks.  For example, the first
chunk would be from offset 0 to 49, the second from 24 to 74, the third
from 49 to 99, etc.  Then use SCAN to see which chunk holds the scan code.
This is by far the easiest, not to mention quickest, method.

One side note on step 1, making the carrier file.  Some virii don't
infect tiny files.  What you must do is create a larger file (duh).
Simply assemble the following two lines:

    int 20h
    db  98 dup (0)

(with all the garbage segment declarations and shit, of course) and
you'll have a nice 100 byte carrier which should be sufficient in most
cases, with maybe the exception of the Darth Vaders.

Enjoy!

         PRIVACY AND GENERAL ELECTIONS: TRICKS OF THE TRADE
         ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

     Spain held general parlamentary elections yesterday, June 6th.
Regardless of the ocutcome (the ruling Socialist Party obtained again
a majority of the seats), one of the parties participating in the
event, "Centrist Unity-Spanish Democratic Party", was expelled of the
race on June 1 by the Electoral Control Committee on the grounds that
the party was actually a sham put up by a group of direct marketing
pirates. It is not the first time it happens but it is the first time
corrective actions are taken again such violations.

     Regardless of the fact that this party had no choice whatsoever
of winning a single seat, it showed again one of the problems
that has been plaguing citizens' privacy in Spain since 1977 (first
democratic elections after forty years of dictatorship): the use for
commercial purposes of the magnetic tapes containing the Election
Census, provided to the parties by the Public Administration.

     Big parties do not seem to have participated in data smuggling
practices but there is evidence that many of the companies that process
the tapes provided by them are the main source of abuse against the
privacy of citizens in regard to their personal data in Spain, since they
duplicate and sell the tapes. This fact has been frequently dennounced by
CLI (*).

     The recently approved Personal Data Law could help to stop these
practices.

* SOME WORDS ABOUT CLI

     The --Commission for Liberties and Informatics, CLI-- is an independent
and pluralistic organization that was officially constituted in April'91.

     Its mission is to "promote the development and protection of citizens'
rights, specially privacy, against misuse of Information Technologies".

     As of May '93, CLI is composed by nine organizations, with a joint
membership of about 3,000,000 people. They cover a very wide spectrum of
social interest groups: associations of computer professionals, judges,
civil rights leagues, trade unions, consumers groups, direct marketing
industry, etc.

     CLI is confederated with similar bodies created in some other Spanish
Regions such as Valencia, Basque Country and Catalonia, and has fluid
working relationships with many public and private Data Protection bodies
and entities all over the world, including CNIL, CPSR and Privacy
International.

     CLI has its headquarters in:

Padilla 66, 3 dcha.
E-28006 Madrid, Spain

                    (CCITT V29, V27ter, V21)
Designed to work with Group III facsimile equipments
Fully compatible for transmission to non-crypto fax equipment (T30 protocol)


Security Features
+-----------------

SurFax is a secret key system type.

(1) KEY MANAGEMENT

The system has an integrated key management.  The user has to enter his 8
figures secret key on keyboard.  A physical key allows the user to let
Surfax in the chosen mode (plain or cipher).

     Otherwise, secret key can be erased at any time at the touch of a button,
and is automatically erased after each communication.  A 32-bit session key is
generated by a "built-in" random number generator.

     Both secret and session keys are combined into a cypher key (2'(59)
possible values) on each terminal.  Both secret and session keys are never
transferred in clear between the two terminals.  A new cypher key is created
for each transmitted page.  Closed user groups can be created by request to
the manufacturer (by setting a customer specific parameter).

(2) CIPHER TECHNOLOGY

The K.E.A. (KTT Encryption Algorithm) is KTT proprietary.  It is a realtime
data ciphering process and is used to encrypt only the facsimile data.

     It is based on a random generator, which initial state relies on a cipher
key, issued from a secret key and a session key (2'(59)).
