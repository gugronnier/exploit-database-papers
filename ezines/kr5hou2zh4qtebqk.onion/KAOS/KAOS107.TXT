I find it amazing that the first e-serial in France should only just
appear in 1993, considering the size and age of Minitel. Does anyone
have any comments on why this should be so?

It just seems to me, Michael, that French >academics< are less turned on to
netting than other nationalities, and they may not see Minitel as a meaningful
>scholarly< medium. While SCHOLAR had at latest count 67 subscribers in
Britain, 83 in Canada, 49 in the Netherlands, 31 in Australia, and 18 in
Japan, only 6 have signed up so far in France, and my associates there ask me
to send them faxes!

From: guedon@ERE.UMontreal.CA (Guedon Jean-Claude )

There is a second answer to Joe Raben's: to publish on Minitel, one
had to have a periodical number, which explains why so many initial Minitel
services were connected with well known publications such as Le Monde, etc...
This was in response to the newspapeprs's fear of being faced with unfair
competition from the new electronic medium and, in fact, some went so far
as to claim that this was a plot to destroy freedom of the press by
destroying the newspapers themselves. In order to reassure them, the
government forced initial publishers on Minitel (I am using the word
"publisher" in an extrapolated meaning, of course) to be connected with
an existing publication.

I don't know if this policy is still in force.

It is only fitting that this happened on the eve of tomorrow's presidential

This is because Jock Gill who handles Email for Clinton was at the
inauguration and not near his computer for a week.  The link is back up and
generating *lots* of mail (press releases) from Clinton.

Si les americains ne cessent de discuter de l'etat de sante des boites-aux-
lettres electroniques de Bill Clinton (ici dans RISKS #14-29/30 et dans
"Computer Privacy Digest" #2.013, Thierry Platon, dans un papier "Download
et e-Mail: la tour de Babel" de son dossier _Les BBS_ ("InfoPC", decembre
1992, no. 87, page 208) ecrit beaucoup mieux:

         Aux Etats-Unis toutefois, on n'utilise pas de code de pays, mais
    plutot des codes correspondant au type de message: .com s'il provient
    d'une entreprise commerciale, .edu pour une universite  ou une ecole,
    .org pour une organisation non commerciale,  .mil pour l'armee, . gov
    pour le gouvernement (Bill.Clinton@whitehouse.gov est une adresse va-
    lable!), etc.

Nous n'avons pas manque de transmettre nos felicitations a Bill Clinton par
un message chaleureux a l'adresse indique. Il nous est revenu avec un
commentaire:

    Your mail to whitehouse.gov is undeliverable.
    whitehouse.gov: unknown host

Mais l'auteur, soucieux de ne pas laisser le lecteur dans une douce ignorance
recidive de plus belle:

    [...] Certains types de BBS commerciaux americains peuvent relier  ce
    type de e-Mail. C'est le cas de CompuServe, par exemple, ou un utili-
    sateur reference 72241,407 aura pour code   72241,407@Compuserve.com.

Thierry Platon n'a jamais utilise de messageries reliees a InterNet. Dans le
cas cite, l'adressage exact pour la plupart des routeurs est particulier. Sur
ATT-Mail, la syntaxe aurait ete:

                      mhs!csmail!72241.4079

Il saurait aussi que les virgules sont interdites en adressage... et qu'
Atlas400 de Transpac n'est pas connecte a InterNet.

Qui me dira pourquoi?

Subject: File 5--Phreacking: Est-ce realisable?


Hey!!!!
I just recently came up with a way that we here could hack our way into the
telephone system.  It involves dialing a long distance number and placing a
counter on the calling card number, if the card number is valid then there
is silence, if it's invalid then it returns a busy line.

I think that a computer with a modem could be programed to dial a selected
number and then place a counter on the calling card number, dial the two and
see if it's busy or not.  If it's busy then cycle to the next card number. A
very simple algorithm.  I was talking to one of my friends that works for the
press and he asked if it was realistic.  I think that it would be.  But the
only problem is that there is 9 digits to the calling card number. :-(

That's 999,999,999 possibilities! this part seems that it would be
unrealistic. What do you think?? Think that it could take a long time or a
short time.  I even thought about getting together a hacking squad, assign a
range to each one to break up the time that it would take.

My friend in the press said that for anyone to believe it I would need proof,
a few simple numbers would sufice.

Any comments??

Subject: Remarks & Warning!

Hi,

I've been a regular reader of Phrack for two years now and I approve fully the
way you continue Phrack.  It's really a wonderful magazine and if I can help
its development in France, I'll do as much as I can!  Anyway, this is not
really the goal of my letter and excuse me for my English, which isn't very
good.

My remarks are about the way you distribute Phrack.  Sometimes, I don't
receive it fully.  I know this is not your fault and I understand that (this
net sometimes has some problems!).  But I think you could provide a mail
server like NETSERV where we could get back issues by mail and just by MAIL
(no FTP).

Some people (a lot in France) don't have any access to international FTP and
there are no FTP sites in France which have ANY issues of Phrack.  I did use
some LISTSERV mailers with the send/get facility.  Could you install it on
your LISTSERV?

My warning is about a "group" (I should say a pseudo-group) founded by Jean
Bernard Condat and called CCCF.  In fact, the JBC have spread his name through
the net to a lot of people in the Underground.  As the Underground place in
France is weak (the D.S.T, anti-hacker staff is very active here and very
efficient), people tend to trust JBC.  He seems (I said SEEMS) to have a good
knowledge in computing, looks kind, and has a lot of resources.  The only
problem is that he makes some "sting" (as you called it some years ago)
operation and uses the information he spied to track hackers.  He organized a
game last year which was "le prix du chaos" (the amount of chaos) where he
asked hackers to prove their capabilities.

It was not the real goal of this challenge.  He used all the materials hackers
send him to harass some people and now he "plays" with the normal police and
the secret police (DST) and installs like a trade between himself and them.
It's really scary for the hacking scene in France because a lot of people
trust him (even the television which has no basis to prove if he is really a
hacker as he claims to be or if he is a hacker-tracker as he IS!).
Journalists take him as a serious source for he says he leads a group of
computer enthusiasts.

But we discovered that his group doesn't exist.  There is nobody in his group
except his brother and some other weird people (2 or 3) whereas he says there
is 73 people in his club/group.  You should spread this warning to everybody
in the underground because we must show that "stings" are not only for USA!
I know he already has a database with a lot of information like addresses and
other stuff like that about hackers and then he "plays" with those hackers.

Be very careful with this guy.  Too many trust him.  Now it's time to be
"objective" about him and his group!

Thanks a lot and goodbye.

Subject: File 7--Re: NTPASS, module chargeable sous NetWare


Cher Monsieur,

Le programme NTPASS pour lequel vous nous demandez notre avis est un NLM,
c'est a dire un module chargeable dynamiquement de NetWare v3.11. Pour l'
installer, il faut donc suivre le processus suivant.

- Il faut tout d'abord  avoir acces physique au serveur.  Nous  tenons  a
vous rappeler que les normes de securite C2 exigent  que l'acces au  ser-
veur soit protege et tout administrateur de reseau qui assure la securite
de son reseau met un acces physique sur les serveurs.

- Il faut ensuite avoir un acces logique au serveur:  NetWare  permet  de
verrouiller la console par un mot de passe.  Encore une fois cette  fonc-
tionnalite est utilise par  tous les administrateurs  et  superviseurs de
reseau quotidiennement.

- Il faut ensuite appeler "AccessData" qui demande le numero de serie  de
NetWare et le numero de serie de NT PASS et qui alors, finalement,  deli-
vre une cle d'acces. Ceci permet de changer  (et non de  restituer  comme
semble le faire croire l'article)  tous les mots de passe:  ceci fait une
difference fondamentale car toute personne du reseau s'en rend compte im-
mediatement.

Qui, dans une societe,  connait le numero de serie du systeme d'exploita-
tion NetWare a l'exception de l'administrateur ou du superviseur?

Donc, en resume, un utilisateur, a partir de son porte  NE PEUT PAS  ins-
taller ce logiciel et briser  la securite de  NetWare.  Si les normes  de
securite les plus elementaires sont respectees  (surtout la premiere), ce
logiciel n'est pas utilisable.

Par contre,  l'objectif initial de ce produit est respecte.  En effet, il
permet a un administrateur qui aurait oublie le mot de passe  superviseur
et qui n'aurait pas cree d'equivalent superviseur  (et cela arrive...) de
se recreer un nouveau mot de passe pour retrouver l'acces a son serveur.

En esperant que ces elements repondent a votre question et restant a  vo-
tre disposition  pour tout renseignement complementaire,  je vous prie de
croire, Monsieur, a l'expression de mes sentiments les meilleurs.

 A  little  book  is  rattling  a  lot  of  chains in the computer security

     Only  two weeks after being picked up by a small publishing house, The
Little Black Book of Computer Viruses has initiated as nasty and divisive a
free speech battle as this community has seen.

     That  is  because  the  178-page  ebony  volume  is  chock full of the
necessary source code for creating potentially destructive viruses. And for
$15,  the  less  technically inclined can simply send in a coupon and order
floppy disks already loaded with compiled and executable virus programs.

    Anger flames

    Professional  virus  fighters such as Alan Solomon at S&S International
are  madder  than  angry hornets over the publication. They are encouraging
anti-black  book  campaigns  that  include  picketing  author Mark Ludwig's
house,  boycotting  shops that sell the book, petitioning Congress and even
bringing in lawyers.

     Others  said  the  book  is relatively harmless because any hacker who
really  wants  to  get  virus  source  code  only has to dial up one of the
innumerable hacker bulletin boards to quickly and easily download dozens of
viruses.

     Critics   dismissed   Ludwig's   First   Amendment   defense   as  the
computational equivalent of yelling ''fire'' in a crowded movie theater.
    Inherently 'evil'

    ''Any  virus,  by its nature, is evil, and Ludwig presents sample after
sample  of  ways  to  go  about  writing damaging code,'' said David Stang,
chairman  of the International Computer Security Association in Washington,
D.C.

     ''The  fundamental  attraction of computers is that we can understand,
control  and  predict  what they do,'' he added. ''We do not want that data
messed with, but Ludwig seems to think it's okay.''

     Not  true, according to Ludwig, who claimed the purpose of the book is
not destructive but educational.

     ''Computer  viruses  are  not  evil,  and  programmers have a right to
create  them, possess them and experiment with them,'' Ludwig said. ''These
viruses  are  designed  so  that security people can see what a virus looks
like  and  how  it  behaves.  How  can anyone realistically be in charge of
security without having ever seen a virus?''

     The  book's  jacket  cautions that those who misuse its viruses can be
held  legally  liable,  even  if the misuse is unintentional. Additionally,
Ludwig  said,  the  viruses  in the book are protected by copyright law and
anyone  who  uses them without his permission will be subject to both civil
and criminal prosecution.

     Stang  has suggested that if Ludwig's altruistic claims are true, then
he  should  offer  to  donate  the  proceeds  from The Little Black Book of
Computer Viruses to a fund that would fight the spread of damaging computer
viruses.

     Others have suggested that Ludwig should have included ''pseudo-code''
versions  of  the viruses, which contain enough information to illustrate a
point without providing a full working virus.

    First in a series

    The  book is scheduled to be the first in a series of three books about
computer  viruses.  Ludwig  first  published the book himself last year and
became  its  primarily  salesman  after  it was reportedly turned down by a
succession of publishers.

     The  Upland, Pa.-based Diane Publishing Co. picked up the distribution
rights to The Little Black Book of Computer Viruses earlier this month.

     ''We  see  nothing  wrong with it,'' Diane Publishing President Herman
Baron  said. ''We put it out for the simple reason that it fits in with our
catalog of computer security books.''
