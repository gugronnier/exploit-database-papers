                **   ONLINE INFORMATION 93   **
                -------------------------------

                      7 - 9 December 1993
                     Olympia 2, London, UK


                        CALL FOR PAPERS


Suggested themes for the 17th International Online Information Meeting
are set out below - a mixture of exciting up-and-coming developments,
techniques and technologies in both established areas as well as newer ones.
Of course, it goes without saying that papers on other topics related to
the overall Online and CD-ROM conference and exhibition (eg database design
and evaluation, search strategies, marketing of information products, CD-ROM
utilization etc) will be equally acceptable.

We are also seeking suitable demonstrative technologies e.g. - the Internet,
creating your own CD-ROMs, et.all.

Suggested Themes:

- Online and Internet;
- Multimedia solutions;
- Image handling;
- Virtual reality;
- New methods of information delivery;
- Full full-text (ie the inclusion of graphs, chemical structures, tables,
  diagrams and pictures as well as text);
- Metadatabases (ie information systems which describe other information
  systems and resources);
- Managing online and CD-ROM.

This year we also anticipate having panels which will include a mix of
users, suppliers and vendors discussing such current topics as: CD-ROM
networking experience; Can we use all the databases and CD-ROMs we have
already or do we need still more? Where do we go from here with online?

Submit an abstract of 300 words to the address below for consideration.
You will then be contacted about writing a full paper.  All full papers have
a deadline of 9 July 1993.

    The Role of Publishers in the Age of Electronically
               Published Scholarly Journals

         - Current Situation and Recommendation -

Objective:
==========

Analysing  the publication process of electronic  journals
shows  that the functions of the publisher are often taken
over  by other participants of the publication chain.  Aim
of  this  diploma thesis is to investigate which functions
publishers   can   hold  in  the  age  of   electronically
published  scholarly journals under economic aspects.  The
main  focus  lies on the distribution via networks.  Other
electronic forms are seen only as complementary.

The  general  functions of publishers,  as  found  in  the
literature,  are the basis for the representation  of  the
current  situation of publishing scholarly journals.  This
is  followed  by  a separate analysis of  the  publisher's
functions  which can be found by electronically  published
scholarly  journals.  Each function will  be  investigated
with  regard to its economic relevance. Results should  be
rated   recommendations  with  consideration  of  possible
problems.   The  thesis  concludes  with  a   consolidated
analysis of the isolated recommendations.

Reading the list of contributors to this work was rather like "old home
week" at VIRUS-L.  The introduction states that the book arose from
Hoffman's frustration over the lack of a suitable text for a virus seminar
and that the seminar participants compiled the material from available
sources.  Even one of the seminar participants, Chris Feudo, has recently
released a computer virus handbook.

Hoffman's "big iron" bias shows through occasionally in his lack of
distinction between "network" and "micro" viral programs (someone with a
$1000 computer "within days can be writing viruses that attempt to break
into world-wide networks") and insists upon destructive and "service denial"
capabilities when defining a virus.  Overall, however, he tries to present a
balanced and realistic view of the virus situation.

The essays contained in the book are grouped into five sections.  The
distinctives between the sections are somewhat clearer than with Denning's
"Computers Under Attack".  The overall design of the book makes a lot of
sense as a textbook (its primary purpose, after all), but may be less lucid
to the home or business user looking for specific direction on protection of
their system.

The first section contains papers that attempt to look at the broad overview
of viral type programs.  Although this book is primarily intended as a text
in computer security courses (presumably at the university level), one still
feels the lack of an initial concise and clear statement of what viral
programs are today.  This desire may be unrealistic: the majority of the
works contained in the book were prepared, at least in initial form, prior
to 1990.  By the time the book was published, however, a larger view of the
virus situation should have been possible.  Still, as introduction and
background material within the context of a virus related course, these
papers are all of significant value.

The second part relates to social and legal topics.  The current state of
(American) law figures heavily in this section.  The discussion of ethics
is quite limited.  Karen Forcht's article on the subject is very terse,
seemingly being only a report of various surveys.  (The most interestingly
point I found in it was the contention, by CEOs, that ethics should be
taught in the classroom, rather than on the job, which displays either a
surprising confidence in the school system, or a definite unwillingness to
face the issue themselves.)

Parts three and four separate the study of viral programs into the realms of
personal (micro) computers and "network" situations.  This distinction is
important, and it is heartening to see it made here.  The opening essay in
the micro section, by Hoffman and Brad Stubbs, attempts to walk the line
between giving information to the user who needs it without giving too much
assistance to virus-writer-wannabes.  In my own view it falls somewhat short
in this, being perhaps more technical than an introductory article warrants.
However, it is a good compilation of the technical background to viral
programs in the MS-DOS environment.  (The micro section closes on a slightly
worse note, with the PC Magazine reviews that are starting to become
somewhat infamous in the virus research community.)

The network virus section contains the two major "dissections" of the
Internet Worm.  Surprisingly, however, none of the other major network
incidents, such as the CHRISTMA EXEC and the "WANK" worm, are mentioned.
Some of the other papers in this section might have more general application
to the virus problem overall, such as studies into cryptographic
authentication.  Others, such as an exploration of viral programs in
"electronic warfare" seem to be "blue sky" exscursions with very little
relation to reality.

The final section is entitled "Emerging Theory of Computer Viruses".  It
contains two articles by Fred Cohen, and one by Leonard Ableman reporting
Fred's findings.  With all due respect to Dr. Cohen, there might be room for
works by other theoreticians here.

As a textbook, this tome contains a diverse range of material well suited to
a seminar on viral programs.  While some of the material is becoming dated,
and some of the points of view are oversimplified, I have not yet found
another book as well surited for raising topics for discussion.  The one
major flaw is the lack of balance and opposition to some of the wilder
flights of fancy.  It would be well to have someone point out that the human
immune system cannot fully be used as an analogy of computer virus defence,
or to point out the difficulties involved in transmitting a virus from a
radio to a fighter aircraft to a military command centre.  In the classroom,
of course, this job belongs to the instructor.

Those looking for a reference for protection against viral programs may find
this book to be unsuitable.  It does, however, have a place as background
material for those large firms in the process of planning overall corporate
data security strategy.  Again, it should be used to generate discussion on
some issues which other "how to" books do not yet address.

(Post scriptum: Lance Hoffman, in responding to the initial draft of this
review, has been most gracious.  He has also acknowledged the shortcomings
of the current version of the book.  There are plans for a new version,
which may be released some time in 1994.  Hopefully the few gaps in the
current work will be covered in that.)
