                   1993 SUMMER CONGRESS, THE NETHERLANDS
=========================================================================

H E U ?
+-------

Remember the Galactic Hacker Party back in 1989? Ever wondered what
happened to the people behind it? We sold out to big business, you
think. Think again, we're back!

That's right. On august 4th, 5th and 6th 1993, we're organising a
three-day summer congress for hackers, phone phreaks, programmers,
computer haters, data travellers, electro-wizards, networkers, hardware
freaks, techno-anarchists, communications junkies, cyberpunks, system
managers, stupid users, paranoid androids, Unix gurus, whizz kids, warez
dudes, law enforcement officers (appropriate undercover dress required),
guerilla heating engineers and other assorted bald, long-haired and/or
unshaven scum. And all this in the middle of nowhere (well, the middle
of Holland, actually, but that's the same thing) at the Larserbos
campground four metres below sea level.

The three days will be filled with lectures, discussions and workshops
on hacking, phreaking, people's networks, Unix security risks, virtual
reality, semafun, social engineering, magstrips, lockpicking,
virusses, paranoia, legal sanctions against hacking in Holland and
elsewhere and much, much more. English will be the lingua franca for
this event, although one or two workshops may take place in Dutch.
There will be an Internet connection, an intertent ethernet and social
interaction (both electronic and live). Included in the price are four
nights in your own tent. Also included are inspiration, transpiration, a
shortage of showers (but a lake to swim in), good weather (guaranteed by
god), campfires and plenty of wide open space and fresh air. All of this
for only 100 dutch guilders (currently around US$70).

We will also arrange for the availability of food, drink and smokes of
assorted types, but this is not included in the price. Our bar will be
open 24 hours a day, as well as a guarded depository for valuables
(like laptops, cameras etc.). You may even get your stuff back! For
people with no tent or air matress: you can buy a tent through us for
100 guilders, a matress costs 10 guilders. You can arrive from 17:00
(that's five p.m. for analogue types) on August 3rd. We don't have to
vacate the premises until 12:00 noon on Saturday, August 7 so you can
even try to sleep through the devastating Party at the End of Time
(PET) on the closing night (live music provided). We will arrange for
shuttle buses to and from train stations in the vicinity.

Payment: in advance please. Un-organized, poor techno-freaks like us
would like to get to the Bahamas at least once. We can only guarantee
you a place if you pay before Friday June 25th, 1993. If you live in
Holland, just transfer fl. 100 to giro 6065765 (Hack-Tic) and mention
'HEU' and your name. If you're in Germany, pay DM 100,- to Hack-Tic,
Konto 2136638, Sparkasse Bielefeld, BLZ 48050161. If you live elsewhere:
call, fax or e-mail us for the best way to get the money to us from your
country. We accept American Express, we do NOT cash ANY foreign cheques.


H A !
+-----

Very Important: Bring many guitars and laptops.


M E ?
+-----

Yes, you! Busloads of alternative techno-freaks from all over the
planet will descend on this event. You wouldn't want to miss that,
now, would you?

Maybe you are part of that select group that has something special to
offer! Participating in 'Hacking at the End of the Universe' is
exciting, but organising your very own part of it is even more fun. We
already have a load of interesting workshops and lectures scheduled,
but we're always on the lookout for more. We're also still in the
market for people who want to help us organize during the congress.

In whatever way you wish to participate, call, write, e-mail or fax us
soon, and make sure your money gets here on time. Space is limited.

'Networking for the masses',   Wednesday August 4th 1993, 15:30
+---------------------------------------------------------------

One of the main discussions at the 1989 Galactic Hacker Party focused on
whether or not the alternative community should use computer networking.
Many people felt a resentment against using a 'tool of oppression' for
their own purposes. Computer technology was, in the eyes of many,
something to be smashed rather than used.

Times have changed. Many who were violently opposed to using computers
in 1989 have since discovered word-processing and desktop publishing.
Even the most radical groups have replaced typewriters with PCs. The
'computer networking revolution' has begun to affect the alternative
community.

Not all is well: many obstacles stand in the way of the 'free flow of
information.' Groups with access to information pay such high prices for
it that they are forced to sell information they'd prefer to pass on for
free. Some low-cost alternative networks have completely lost their
democratic structure. Is this the era of the digital dictator, or are we
moving towards digital democracy?

To discuss these and other issues, we've invited the following people
who are active in the field of computer networking: [Electronic mail
addresses for each of the participants are shown in brackets.]

Ted Lindgreen (ted@nluug.nl) is managing director of nlnet. Nlnet is the
largest commercial TCP/IP and UUCP network provider in the Netherlands.

Peter van der Pouw Kraan (peter@hacktic.nl) was actively involved in the
squat-movement newsletters 'Bluf!' and 'NN' and has outspoken ideas
about technology and its relation to society. Had a PC all the way back
in 1985!

Maja van der Velden (maja@agenda.hacktic.nl) is from the Agenda
Foundation which sets up and supports communication and information
projects.

Joost Flint (joost@aps.hacktic.nl) is from the Activist Press Service.
APS has a bbs and works to get alternative-media and pressure groups
online.

Felipe Rodriquez (nonsenso@utopia.hacktic.nl) is from the Hack-Tic
Network which grew out of the Dutch computer underground and currently
connects thousands of people to the global Internet.

Andre Blum (zabkar@roana.hacktic.nl), is an expert in the field of
wireless communications.

Eelco de Graaff (Eelco.de.Graaff@p5.f1.n281.z2.fidonet.org) is the
nethost of net 281 of FidoNet, EchoMail troubleshooter, and one of the
founders of the Dutch Fidonet Foundation.

Michael Polman (michael@antenna.nl) of the Antenna foundation is a
consultant in the field of international networking. He specialises in
non-governmental networks in the South.

Alfred Heitink (alfred@antenna.nl) is a social scientist specializing in
the field of computer-mediated communication as well as system manager at
the Dutch Antenna host.

Rena Tangens (rena@bionic.zer.de), was involved in the creation of the
Bionic Mailbox in Bielefeld (Germany) and the Zerberus mailbox network.
She is an artist and wants to combine art and technology.

The discussion will be led by freelance radiomaker and science
journalist Herbert Blankesteyn. He was involved in the 'Archie'
children's bbs of the Dutch VPRO broadcasting corporation.

Many years ago people discovered that one could fool the telephone
network into thinking you were part of the network and not just a
customer. As a result, one could make strange and sometimes free
phonecalls to anywhere on the planet. A subculture quickly formed.

The phone companies got wise and made a lot of things (nearly)
impossible. What is still possible today? What is still legal today?
What can they do about it? What are they doing about it?

Billsf (bill@tech.hacktic.nl) and M. Tillman, a few of the worlds best
phreaks, will introduce the audience to this new world. Phone phreaks
from many different countries will exchange stories of succes and
defeat. Your life may never be the same.


'Hacking (and) The Law',   Friday August 6th, 14:00
+---------------------------------------------------

You can use your own computer and modem to access some big computer
system at a university without the people owning that computer knowing
about it. For years this activity was more or less legal in Holland: if
you were just looking around on the Internet and didn't break anything
nobody really cared too much...

That is, until shortly before the new computer crime law went into
effect. Suddenly computer hackers were portrayed as evil 'crashers'
intent on destroying systems or, at least, looking into everyone's
files.

The supporters of the new law said that it was about time something was
done about it. Critics of the law say it's like hunting mosquitoes with
a machine-gun. They claim the aforementioned type of hacking is not the
real problem and that the law is excessively harsh.

To discuss these issues we've invited a panel of experts, some of whom
are, or have been, in touch with the law in one way or another.

Harry Onderwater (fridge@cri.hacktic.nl), is technical EDP auditor at the
Dutch National Criminal Intelligence Service (CRI) and is responsible for
combatting computer crime in the Netherlands. He says he's willing to
arrest hackers if that is what it takes to make computer systems secure.

Prof. Dr. I.S. (Bob) Herschberg (herschbe@dutiws.twi.tudelft.nl), gained
a hacker's control over his first system 21 years ago and never ceased
the good work. Now lecturing, teaching and publishing on computer
insecurity and imprivacy at the technical university in Delft. His
thesis: 'penetrating a system is not perpetrating a crime'.

Ronald 'RGB' O. (rgb@utopia.hacktic.nl) has the distinction of being the
only Dutch hacker arrested before and after the new law went into effect.
He is a self-taught UNIX security expert and a writer for Hack-Tic
Magazine.

Ruud Wiggers (ruudw@cs.vu.nl), system manager at the Free University
(VU) in Amsterdam, has for 10 years been trying to plug holes in system
security. He was involved in the RGB arrest.

Andy Mueller-Maguhn (andy@cccbln.ccc.de) is from the Chaos Computer Club
in Germany.

Eric Corley (emmanuel@eff.org) a.k.a. Emmanuel Goldstein is editor
of the hacker publication '2600 magazine'. The first person to realize
the huge implications of the government crackdown on hackers in the US.

Winn Schwartau (wschwartau@mcimail.com) is a commercial computer
security advisor as well as the author of the book 'Terminal
Compromise'. His new book entitled 'Information Warfare' has just been
released.

Ray Kaplan (kaplan@bpa.arizona.edu) is a computer security consultant.
He is constantly trying to bridge the gap between hackers and the
computer industry. He organizes 'meet the enemy' sessions where system
managers can teleconference with hackers.

Wietse Venema (wietse@wzv.win.tue.nl) is a systems expert at the
Technical University in Eindhoven. He is the author of some very well
known utilities to monitor hacking on unix systems. He has a healthy
suspicion of anything technical.

Peter Klerks (klerks@rulfsw.leidenuniv.nl) is a scientist at the centre
for the study of social antagonism at the Leiden University. He has
studied the Dutch police force extensively, and is author of the book
'Counterterrorism in the Netherlands.'

Don Stikvoort (stikvoort@surfnet.nl), one of the computer security
experts for the Dutch Academic Society and chairman of CERT-NL (Computer
Emergency Response Team). He is also actively involved in SURFnet
network management.

Rop Gonggrijp (rop@hacktic.nl) was involved in some of the first
computer break-ins in the Netherlands during the 80's and is now editor
of Hack-Tic Magazine.

The discussion will be led by Franscisco van Jole (fvjole@hacktic.nl),
journalist for 'De Volkskrant'.

COMPUTERS AT 'HACKING AT THE END OF THE UNIVERSE'
+-------------------------------------------------

This will get a little technical for those who want to know what we're
going to set up. If you don't know much about computers, just bring
whatever you have and we'll see how and if we can hook it up.

We're going to have ethernet connected to Internet (TCP/IP). You can
connect by sitting down at one of our PC's or terminals, by hooking up
your own equipment (we have a depository, so don't worry about theft),
or by using one of our 'printerport <--> ethernet' adapters and
hooking up laptops and notebooks that way. There may be a small fee
involved here, we don't know what they're going to cost us. Contact us
for details, also if you have a few of these adapters lying around.
There might also be serial ports you can connect to using a nullmodem
cable.

You can log in to our UNIX system(s) and send and receive mail and
UseNet news that way. Every participant that wants one can get her/his
own IP number to use worldwide. Users of the network are urged to make
whatever files they have on their systems available to others over the
ethernet. Bring anything that has a power cord or batteries and let's
network it!
