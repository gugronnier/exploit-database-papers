                            INTERNET BASICS

                            By Roy Tennant

This digest briefly describes the Internet computer network, the
physical connections and logical agreements that make it possible,
and the applications and information resources the network provides.

The Internet

The Internet is a worldwide network of computer networks. It is
comprised of thousands of separately administered networks of many
sizes and types. Each of these networks is comprised of as many as
tens of thousands of computers; the total number of individual users
of the Internet is in the millions. This high level of connectivity
fosters an unparalleled degree of communication, collaboration,
resource sharing, and information access. In the United States, the
National Science Foundation Network (NSFNet) comprises the Internet
"backbone" (a very high speed network that connects key regions
across the country). The NSFNet will likely evolve into the National
Research and Education Network (NREN) as defined in the High-
Performance Computing Act of 1991 (P.L. 102-194, signed into law by
President Bush on December 9, 1991).

Physical Connections and Logical Agreements

For the Internet to exist, there must be connections between
computers and agreements on how they are to communicate. Connections
can consist of any of a variety of communication media or methods:
metal wires, microwave links, packet radio or fiber optic cables.
These connections are usually established within areas or regions by
the particular networking organization with authority or economic
interest in that area. For example, a university academic department
may lay Ethernet cable to connect its personal computers and
workstations into a local area network (LAN), which is then connected
to the cables the campus laid to connect its buildings together,
which is then linked to cables laid by a regional network, which
itself ties into the NSFNet backbone, the infrastructure for which
was funded by the U.S. government. Therefore the path between any two
points on the Internet often traverses physical connections that are
administered by a variety of independent authorities.

For disparate computers (from personal computers to mainframes) to
communicate with other computers over a network, there must be
agreements on how that should occur. These agreements are called
communication protocols. At present, the Transmission Control Protocol/
Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) suite of protocols defines how
Internet computers are to communicate. In the future, the Open
Systems Interconnection (OSI) suite of protocols promulgated by the
International Standards Organization (ISO) may be supported on the
Internet as well. These protocols define how certain applications are
to be accomplished:  electronic messaging, online connections, and
the transfer of files.

Electronic Mail

Electronic mail, or e-mail, is a fast, easy, and inexpensive way to
communicate with other Internet users around the world. In addition,
it is possible for Internet users to exchange e-mail with users of
other independent networks such as CompuServe, Applelink, the WELL,
and others. Internet users often find that the expanded capability to
communicate with colleagues around the world leads to important new
sources of information, collaboration, and professional development.

Besides basic correspondence between two network users, e-mail
presents additional opportunities for communication. Through various
methods for distributing e-mail messages to lists of "subscribers,"
e-mail supports electronic discussions on a wide range of topics.
These discussions bring together like-minded individuals who use such
forums for discussing common problems, sharing solutions, and arguing
issues.

Another type of electronic communication that is growing in
popularity is the electronic journal, or "e-journal." Although some
e-journals require certain types of software and hardware to display
each issue, most e-journals are distributed to a list of subscribers
as an e-mail text message, either complete as one issue, or
retrievable at the article level by mailing a command to a software
program that automatically sends the appropriate file. The very
definition of a "journal" is undergoing change in the electronic
environment, as e-journal publishers experiment with different
publication models (e.g., sending articles out individually as soon
as they are ready rather than waiting until a group of articles are
gathered for an "issue").

Remote Login

Remote login is the ability of a computer user in one location to
establish an online connection with another computer elsewhere. Once
a connection is established with a remote computer, the user can use
that remote system as if their computer were a hard-wired terminal of
that system. Within the TCP/IP protocol suite, this facility is
called Telnet. Utilizing Telnet, an Internet user can establish
connections with a multitude of bibliographic databases (primarily
library catalogs), campus information systems of various
universities, full-text databases, data files (e.g., statistics,
oceanographic data, meteorologic data, geographic data, etc.), and
other online services. Many of these systems are available for any
Internet user to access and use without an account.

What makes this application truly remarkable is that ease and speed
of access are not dependent upon proximity. An Internet user can
connect to a system on the other side of the globe as easily as (and
generally not much slower than) he or she can connect to a system in
the next building. In addition, since many Internet users are not at
present charged for their network use by their institutions, or at
least are not charged by the level of their use, cost is often not a
significant inhibitor of usage. Therefore the barriers of distance,
time and cost, which are often significant when using other forms of
electronic communication, can be reduced in the Internet environment.
A compensating disadvantage is that initial costs for Internet
connection can be high, and access can be technically demanding.

File Transfer

Another application of the Internet is the ability to transfer files
from one Internet-connected computer to another. This function is
provided by the File Transfer Protocol (FTP) of the TCP/IP protocol
suite. In a method similar to using Telnet, network users initiate an
online connection with another Internet computer via FTP. But unlike
Telnet, this online connection can perform only functions related to
locating and transferring files. This includes the ability to change
directories, list files, retrieve files, etc.

Types of files that can be transferred using FTP include virtually
every kind of file that can be stored on a computer: text files,
software programs, graphic images, sounds, files formatted for
particular software programs (e.g., files with word processing
formatting instructions), and others. Many computer administrators
have set aside portions of their machines to offer files for anyone
on the Internet to retrieve. These archive sites support "anonymous"
logins that do not require an account to access, and therefore are
called anonymous FTP sites. To locate files, Internet users can use
the Archie service, which indexes files from over 900 separate
anonymous FTP sites (Tennant, 1993).

Extended Services

The three basic Internet applications of electronic mail, remote
login, and file transfer are also building blocks of more
sophisticated applications that usually offer increased functionality
and ease of network use. Tools such as Gopher, WAIS, and World Wide
Web go beyond the three basic Internet functions to make information
on the network easier to locate and use. Gopher is a project of the
University of Minnesota that uses a series of menus to organize and
automate access to information and other online systems wherever they
reside on the Internet. The Wide Area Information Servers (WAIS)
project of Thinking Machines, Apple Computer, Dow Jones & Co., and
KPMG Peat Marwick, seeks to provide a common interface to a multitude
of Internet databases. World Wide Web is a hypertext interface to
Internet information resources that was developed at CERN in
Switzerland (Tennant, 1993). This trend toward more powerful, user-
friendly networked information resource access systems is likely to
continue as the Internet grows and matures.

Future Possibilities

The backbone infrastructure for the United States portion of the
Internet (the NSFNet, or the Interim NREN) is largely supported
through federal government funding. For this reason, use of the
network has been limited to non-profit research and educational uses,
and commercial companies have established networking arrangements
that avoid using the NSFNet. Most recently, however, dialogues have
begun about commercialization and privatization of the NSFNet
infrastructure. The full effects of such a move on current Internet
users, especially research and educational institutions, has yet to
be seen. One certainty is that the breadth of information and the
services offered on the Internet will continue to burgeon, at an ever
more rapid rate.

    Fraude minitel -  Des ministeres ou administrations victimes de
"pirates du minitel" : un prejudice de plusieurs millions de francs-
PARIS, 1er oct  92 (250 MOTS)
  Des administrations ou ministeres ont ete victimes a Paris ces
derniers mois de "pirates du minitel" travaillant a France-Telecom,
et huit personnes ont ete inculpees alors que le prejudice est
globalement estime a des millions de francs, apprend-on jeudi de
bonne source.
  Une estimation precise du prejudice etait, indique-t-on, "difficile
a etabir en l'etat actuel de l'enquete".
   Des tehniciens de France-Telecom sont soupconnes de s'etre
"branches" illegalement, a l'insu des victimes, sur leurs lignes
telephoniques empruntees par le minitel. Ils ont "largement profite"
de celles-ci, appelant par exemple des serveurs specialises dans des
jeux sur ecran ou, ajoute-t-on, "les communications s'eternisent
quand il s'agit de remporter un lot".
   Le palais de justice a Paris s'est apercu le premier de cette
escroquerie presumee - reprimee par la recente loi sur l'informatique
- en constatant une note "tres elevee" de minitel. Celle-ci aurait en
effet atteint, ajoute-t-on, quelque 800.000 francs sur plusieurs
mois. Le Senat, les ministeres des affaires etrangeres ou des DOM-TOM
figureraient notamment au nombre des victimes.
      Une enquete a ete ouverte puis confiee a la Brigade financiere
de Paris qui a procede, en debut de semaine, a une quinzaine
d'interpellations de suspects en region parisienne. Huit d'entre eux
ont ete presentes au juge Linais jeudi puis inculpes et laisses en
liberte sous controle judiciaire. D'autres inculpations "pourraient
suivre" ces prochains jours, conclut-on.

                       OECD SECURITY GUIDELINES

        The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development
(OECD) has adopted international Guidelines for the Security of
Information Systems.  The Guidelines are intended to raise awareness
of the risks in the use of information systems and to establish a
policy framework to address public concerns.

        A copy of the press release and an excerpt from the Guidelines
follows.  For additional information or for a copy of the guidelines,
contact Ms. Deborah Hurley, OECD, 2 rue Andre-Pascal, 75775 Paris

=============================================================

"OECD ADOPTS GUIDELINES FOR THE SECURITY OF INFORMATION SYSTEMS

        "The 24 OECD Member countries on 26th November 1992 adopted
Guidelines for the Security of Information Systems, culminating almost
two years' work by an OECD expert group composed of governmental
delegates, scholars in the fields of law, mathematics and computer
science, and representatives of the private sector, including computer
and communication goods and services providers and users.

        "The term information systems includes computers,
communication facilities, computer and communication networks and the
information that they process.  These systems play an increasingly
significant and pervasive role in a multitude of activities, including
national economies, international trade, government and business
operation, health care, energy, transport, communications and
education.

        "Security of information systems means the protection of the
availability, integrity, and confidentiality of information systems.
It is an international issue because information systems frequently
cross national boundaries.

        "While growing use of information systems has generated many
benefits, it has also shown up a widening gap between the need to
protect systems and the degree of protection currently in place.
Society has become very dependent on technologies that are not yet
sufficiently dependable.  All individuals and organizations have a
need for proper information system operations (e.g. in hospitals, air
traffic control and nuclear power plants).

        "Users must have confidence that information systems will be
available and operate as expected without unanticipated failures or
problems.  Otherwise, the systems and their underlying technologies
may not be used to their full potential and further growth and
innovation may be prohibited.

        "The Guidelines for the Security of Information Systems will
provide the required foundation on which to construct a framework for
security of information systems.  They are addressed to the public and
private sectors and apply to all information systems.  The framework
will include policies, laws, codes of conduct, technical measures,
management and user practices, ad public education and awareness
activities at both national and international levels.

        "Several OECD Member countries have been forerunners in the
field of security of information systems.  Certain laws and
organizational and technical rules are already in place.  Most other
countries are much farther behind in their efforts.  The Guidelines
will play a normative role and assist governments and the private
sector in meeting the challenges of these worldwide systems.  The
Guidelines bring guidance and a  real value-added to work in this
area, from a national and international perspective."

PRINCIPLES

general extent of measures, practices and procedures for the security
of information systems.

"3. Ethics Principle

should be provided and used in such a  manner that the rights and
legitimate interests of others are respected.

"4. Multidisciplinary Principle

        "Measures practices and procedures for the security of
information systems should take into account of and address all
relevant consideration and viewpoints, including technical,

        "Security levels, costs, measures, practices and procedures
should be appropriate and proportionate to the value of and degree of
reliance on the information systems and to the severity, probability
and extent of potential harm, as the requirements for security vary
depending upon the particular information systems.

"6. Integration Principle

other and with other measures, practices and procedures of the
organization so as to create a coherent system of security.

international levels, should act in a timely co-ordinated manner to
prevent and to respond to breaches of information systems."

"8.  Reassessment Principle

        "The security information systems should be reassessed
periodically, as information systems and the requirements for their
security vary over time.

"9. Democracy Principle

        "The security of information systems should be compatible with
the legitimate use and flow of data ad information in a democratic
society."
