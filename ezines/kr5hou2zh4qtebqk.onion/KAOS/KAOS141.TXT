                               Whats New
                               ---------

     Well a lot of things been going on this month.  Well I've been
     really lazy lately and haven't gotten around to writing this issue
     for over two months I guess.  Well let me tell you whats been going
     on.

     Let me take the time now to address these lame fucking people who,
     if they had 9600+ modems, would be wares puppies, but being they
     have a 2400 they decide to practice there leeching habits on
     viruses.  They are the virus collectors, they ones who never run
     the damn things, just add them to there collection and upload them
     here and there to be really, as they say, "K-K00\_."  Please
     mother fuckers, stop.  I mean look at the Red Cross virus, does
     anyone have the real copy of it?  Some lame ass collector found
     something that scanned as Red-X and was "/> a |)" enough to upload
     it everywhere.  Please, give it up.  Virus BBS's are a great thing,
     and without them we would be lost, but by the same tolken these
     collectors, or as someone once said, "Micro-Wares Puppies," must
     get with the program or die.

     Well second of all, I've been calling The Homebase quite a bit
     lately and came to one conclusion, people are dumb.  Look in this
     issue for some scroll backs of stupid things people have posted on
     that BBS this month or so.

     The Bob Ross virus has been released in the mist, so watch what you
     D/L.  Hmmmm, I think SCAN 85 caught it, but that will change soon,
     right DA?

     Funny story.  I infected my schools computer with several viruses
     before I transferred out.  Well what I heard happened from that is
     this.  They somehow could not get the viruses to dissapper no
     matter what they did.  Incedently it was Whale and some other
     viruses. Anyway, out of the fustration of the viruses reappering
     all the time, they decided to out and get rid of all the hard
     drives.  So they removed all the hard drives from all the systems
     and put them in storage.  Anyway, they finally got a virus expert
     to come it, he said that they didn't have to get rid of the hard
     drives he can rid the viruses.  Well to late.  The art department
     had got a hold of them and wealded them together into one big
     statue!  Thousands of dollars worth of hardware down they drain.
     The school was so embarressed at the whole thing they shipped the
     statue way out of state where so everybody would soon forget this
     screwup.  Thanks to Shade of Sorrow for finding that one out for
     me.

     SCAN 85 _is_ out, 'nuff said.

     Bet you all heard the story about Novell and Stoned III?  If not
     this is the run down.  Novell got infected by Stoned III.  Novell
     distributed infected copies of the December update to everyone.
     That's the story.

                           The Bob Ross Virus

This is the infamous Bob Ross virus by Dark Angel of Phalcon/Skism.

Here's a bit from the author first.

 The Funky Bob Ross Virus Version 1.0
 Written by Dark Angel / 26 September 1991 / (c) 1991
 PHALCON/SKISM Co-op
 Effective length: 1125, Resident length: 672 bytes

 DEDICATION:
   This virus was written expressedly to
      1) Piss off Patty Hoffman, John McAffee, Ross Greenberg, and all the
         other guru-wanna-bes in this world.
      2) Spread the message of The Almighty Bob, and so enrichen the lives
         of people all over the world.
      3) Show off (Now I can tell people that I wrote a virus!)

 WHAT THIS IS:
   This is a self-encrypting, non-overwriting COM infector.  It doesn't do
   anything to EXE files.  File sizes increase by 1117 bytes.  It goes off
   on July 9th of any year or after 7 infection "waves."

 WHAT IT DOES WHEN IT GOES OFF:
   The virus goes memory resident and prints out a Bobism every 5 minutes.
   It then enters a delay loop for approximately 5 seconds, allowing for a
   brief moment of silence while the victim reads Bob's holy message.  The
   virus will not destroy anything.  The virus will not go TSR if it finds
   another copy of itself in memory.


 Well, here it is, the hex dump, by now you should know how to compile
 it from the hex dump.

The virus itself is only 1125 bytes, this file is 3125 to account for an
infected file.

Scan 85 detects it as the [Beta] virus, but strain-b will be out soon.

                             The Sunday Virus

        According to Patty Hoffman, the Sunday virus is based on the
Jerusalem viruses, because the codes for both viruses are similar.
Sunday infects COM, EXE, and OVL files, when they are executed, and it
stays resident in memory.  It was circulated around the Seattle,
Washington area in 1989, and is quite common.  Sunday can be picked up
by almost every scanner out there.  The SCAN ID code for this virus
is "CD 21 80 FC 04 75 10" in lines 01E0 and 01F0.
        This version of Sunday doesn't seem to print any messages on
the screen, however, some versions do, every Sunday.  This virus
spreads rapidly, and replicates quite well.


      To create SUNDAY.COM, cut out the following code, and name the
resulting file sunday.txt.  Then, use this command:  DEBUG < SUNDAY.TXT

                                                       --DecimatoR
