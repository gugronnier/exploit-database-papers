                I'm back, well kind of.  Anyways, a lot of people have been
asking, "What's going on with the group?" The question should be, "What's
going on with any group these days?" It seems to me that 1992 was the death
of h/p, or at least the "ice age" of it.  Everybody was either getting busted
or quitting the scene.  Oh well, what can I say about it.  Our group has been
having bad luck too.  Five (now six) busted as well as other assorted bad
things happening to members.

                Anyways, what's going on with us, huh?.  Well the reason you
haven't heard much from us is because we haven't been releasing our new stuff
to BBS systems (BBS system sounds as redundant as PIN number, I know) because
we have a strong feeling that members of such groups as the CVIA are logging
on to h/p boards in the hope of snatching the latest viruses.  Well not much
you can do about it if you run a BBS, unless you personnally know everyone
who calls your board. But come to think of it - what good does it prove to
release your newest creation to the general public (of the h/p crowd) via BBS
system?  Isn't that the same principle as the warez puppy scene?  I guess you
all can do whatever turns you on but we kind of decided that it would be in
our best interests to release our stuff to BBS's only after they have been
detected by the popular scanners or until they are kind of old.  Not to fear,
40-HEX and "Dark Angel Phunky Writing Guide" will still be on boards at the
same rate as always.

                As for all of you people bitching that no longer have sites
and that we are dead, well your dead - wrong.  The current sites are as
follows (in no specific order) - Digital Warfare (yes it's back, at a new
number however), Time Lords BBS (The U.S.S.R System), The Phunline (yes it's
back), and the newest addition - Crow Technology.  And as for us being dead
yeah right.

** Note from DecimatoR:
The U.S.S.R System recently went down, due to Time Lord getting into a little
hot water.  It WILL return however... we're just not sure when. **

** Note from GHeap:
I am coming back, gimme mo' time!

                So now with that out of the way, on the other news. Hmmm...
Michelangelo caused quite a scare there for a while.  It was pretty cool
to see John, Patti, and the rest of the crew on T.V... John Dvorak has a new
half hour computer talk show on syndicated radio.  I'm sure he wouldn't mind
if we got on the show some time soon.  Check your local radio guide for your
local station and time... I am offering a standing bounty of $1,500 for the
person willing to fly to Ohio and kick Crow Meisters ass for good.  A minor
would be preferred, being that he is under 18 and if I smashed him I could
get sued or something.  Just kidding, Crow Meister is cool with me,
hihihihi... A new federal law is being considered which if passed will outlaw
the authorship of computer viruses totally, research or not.  Read more about
that later in this issue... Hey, I might have a BBS up soon!  I have been
saying that for the past 2 years haven't I?  Well that's the news as I see
it, it's nice to be writing for this rag again.

        Check ya in 25 to life....

   Well, this little news "tid-bit" came from Attitude Adjuster, one of the
few non-PHALCON/SKISM contributers (ok, the ONLY non P/S member), Thanks a
lot dude, keep the submissions coming.  The article itself is quite sad,
and makes me question the intelligence of our opposition.

                    - We need Computer Virus Snitches -
              Written By Mike Royko, Tribune Media Services.
                      Retyped by The Attitude Adjuster

===========================================================================
        Millions  of computer users are wondering how to protect themselves
against  the wave of viruses that are threatening their machines. I have  a
suggestion.[So do I, avoid Bnu 1.90Beta]

        First, they  should  remember  that these viruses don't spring from
nature. They  are  little  computer  programs  that are created and sent on
their  way  by people  that are brainy,  malicious and  arrogant.[I am  not
brainy]

        So,  the  question is,  how  do you  find  the creators of computer
virus programs?

        Because  they are  arrogant, it's  likely that they want someone to
know what a clever thing they have done. They won't hold a press conference
[Actually, we do hold press conferences.See MichaelAlexander@Computerworld]
but  chances  are they  will brag  to a  trusted friend  or acquaintance or
fellow hacker.

        It is sad, but the world is full of snitches.[Get a thesaurus] Look
at John Gotti,  the nation's  biggest Mafia boss.  There was a time when it
was  unthinkable for  even the lowest-level Mafia soldier to blab.  But now
Gotti has to sit in court while his former  right-hand  man tells about how
they got people whacked.  [We whack people too]

        So if Mafia  figures can be persuaded to tattle[Na-na-na-na-na], is
there any reason  to believe that nerds  have a greater  sense of honor and
loyalty?  [Yes, we also have brains]

       Of course[.] not, but how do you get them to do it?

       Money. [Now yer talking... my mom is really the Dark Avenger, I want
my money now.]

       These  companies [what companies,  I only  hit hospitals]  could use
petty cash  to place  ads in the  computer magazines and on  the electronic
bulletin boards.  [Ok, call my BBS and  post this tidbit.  40Hex now has ad
space available]

       The  ads  would  say  something  like: "A  $50,000  reward  for  any
information leading to the arrest and conviction of virus authors."

[How can you convict a virus author. It isn't illegal.  Go play Tank Wars.]

       The  next question  would be  what to  do with the virus makers once
they  have been  caught. And  that's  the  key  to putting  an  end to  the
problem:  something  that could  be  posted  on  those electronic  bulletin
boards  that  might cause  an aspiring  virus-maker to go take a brisk walk
instead.

        A judge  would sit  and listen  to an  attorney who would say some-
thing like this:

        "Your  honor,  what we  have here  is an  otherwise  fine young man
from  a good  family. His  father is  a brilliant scholar, and the son will
someday be the same."[I am going to be a certified scholar when I grow up.]

        "What  he did  was no  more than  an intellectual prank, a cerebral
challenge of  sorts. Like  the man who climbed Mount Everest because it was
there, he created the virus and sent it fourth because it was there."

        Then, we can hope, the judge might say something like this:

        "Yes,  I am  impressed  by  the  defendant's  brain  power.  And  I
expected you to ask me to give him a slap on the wrist."

        "However,  he  is  not  a child.  He is an adult. And I would think
that  so  brilliant a  grown  man would  know better  than to amuse himself
by screwing with the lives of strangers."  [I haven't screwed one stranger]

        "It's  as if  he hid  inside  the businesses and institutions until
they  were closed  and  everyone had  gone home. Then  he came out and went
through  every  filing cabinet  and drawer and shredded or burned every bit
of useful information he could find."[Cool! Lets try it.]

        "Now,  counselor, what  would you and your law partners say is some
street mope [See Thesaurus] did that  to your firm - crept in and destroyed
every document in your offices? Including the names of clients that owe you
money. Hah, you would be in here asking me to hang him from a tree."[I love
hanging from trees]

        "So  don't  give  me that  smart  kid  from  a good family routine.
[I ain't smart, and family ain't good] He is a self-centered,  insensitive,
uncaring,  arrogant goofball  [And  damn proud].  He didn't  give a  second
thought to the  chaos or  heartbreak he would  cause an adoption  agency, a
hardworking businessman or a medical clinic." [Yes I did.  I aim for them.]

        "Therefore,  I sentence him  to the maximum sentence the law allows
in the local jailhouse [0, NUL, ZIP-o, /dev/null, etc..], which is a really
terrible place, filled with all sorts of crude, insensitive hulks."
[Jay-walkers]

        "Bailiff,  please get the defendent up off the floor and administer
some smelling salts."[More like, why is the defendant laughing?]

        "And change his trousers, quickly."[Fuck you]

                I hope you enjoyed that one as much as I did! Okay, I
        see some really neat things with this man's article. First off,
        I'm sure he's an adept programmer... that is, he can probably
        figure out how to get his VCR to tape something while he is
        off writing his brilliant articles. I enjoy his narrow-minded
        definition of virii (that was mentioned in 40Hex 5), of course,
        all virii are those evil overwriting, trigger date, resident,
        boot track infecting swine (yeah, he probably learned what a
        virus was from watching ABC News covering the Michaelangelo
        crisis!)

                I also enjoy his opinion that all virus authors are
        nerds.  First off, what the hell is a nerd?  I mean, I have
        written a virus before (not saying it was any good), but, I
        don't feel like a nerd!  In fact, I feel quite superior to
        most of the idiots like this guy.  And, I like his great
        statement about my loyalty.  Yes, I'm gonna narc on [PHALCON/
        [Forget this again, and die]]SKISM for $50,000!!! Yeah, right.
        There are a lot of narcs on this not-so good earth, so choose
        your friends wisely.

                I'm quite sure that ads on BBS's (electronic bulletin
        boards! No... cork ones!) would just sufficiently pump up user
        discussion of virii.  I'm not scared of fed intervention, and
        I doubt any authors I know are either.

                This was touched on in 40Hex 5, virus authors are not
        responsible for the spread of their virii unless they are
        actively spreading them!  I mean, it's not my fault that K-Rad
        Man sent my Hard Drive Blender (slices, dices, minces sectors)
        to 1000 Bible boards in Utah. Apparently it hasn't dawned on
        this guy that most virii are not written to be destructive.
        Actually, that's a lie.  There are a lot of virii out there that
        are descructive, but that is changing.  People like the
        PHALCON/SKISM crew realize that not everything must be
        destructive, opening the doors to much larger virus projects
        (ie Bobisms)

                One more thing... QUIT EQUATING THE WORD 'hacker' TO
        EVERY DAMN TYPE OF ELECTRONIC 'crime!!!'

                I'm gonna get this dude's phone #, I say we call him
        sometime...

Removal Instructions:  F-Prot, VirHunt 2.0+, or delete infected files
General Comments:

The Kennedy virus was isolated in April 1990.  It is a generic
infector of .COM files, including COMMAND.COM.

This virus has three activation dates: June 6 (assassination of
Robert Kennedy 1968), November 18 (death of Joseph Kennedy 1969),
and November 22 (assassination of John F. Kennedy 1963) of any year.
On activation, the virus will display a message the following
message:

        "Kennedy is dead - long live 'The Dead Kennedys'"

The following text strings can be found in the viral code:

        "\command.com"
        "The Dead Kennedys"

Systems infected with the Kennedy virus will experience
cross-linking of files, lost clusters, and file allocation table
errors (including messages that the file allocation table is bad).

  Ok there it is. Not the most impressive virus around and its caught by just
about every scan on the market, but take PKLite to it and then remove the
PKLite header (Use NOLITE in this issue) and no one will be able to find it.
Anyway it gets the job done.

To make the above hex into a working file, first cut on the dotted lines.
Name the resulting file KENNEDY.TXT.
Then: DEBUG < KENNEDY.TXT  and you'll have a working virus.

Subject: MBDF Suspects Arrested (Mac)

The Cornell Daily Sun reported in this morning's issue that two
Cornell University sophomores, David Blumenthal and Mark Pilgrim, were
arrested Monday evening and arraigned in Ithaca City Court on one
count each of second degree computer tampering, in connection with the
release of the MBDF virus that infected Macs worldwide over the last
several days.  The two are being held in Tompkins County Jail.
*< huh?  How does one get arrested for spreading a virus, you ask? read on >*
Further charges are pending.

Subject: Alleged MBDF virus-creators arrested at Cornell

"Computer Virus Traced to Cornell Students"

by Jeff Carmona

[The Cornell Daily Sun, 25 February 1992]

  Two Cornell students were arrested yesterday for allegedly creating and
launching *< launching ? Bon voyage, we launched you !>* a computer virus
that crippled computers around the world, according to M. Stuart Lynn, the
University's vice president for information technologies.

  David Blumenthal '94 and Mark Pilgrim '94 were arrested by Department of
Public Safety officers and arraigned in Ithaca City Court on one count of
second-degree computer tampering, a misdemeanor, *< cool, its only a
misdemeanor, how bad could it be ? >* Lynn said.

  Both students were remanded to the Tompkins County Jail and remained in
custody early this morning. They are being held on $2,000 cash or $10,000
bail bond, officials said.

  Cornell received national attention in Nov. 1988 when Robert T. Morris
Jr., a former graduate student, was accused of unleashing a computer virus
into thousands of government and university computers.

  Morris, convicted under the 1986 Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, was fined
$10,000, given a three-year probation and ordered to do 400 hours of
community service by a federal judge in Syracuse, according to Linda Grace-
Kobas, *< Whats a Koba?? >* director of the Cornell News Service.

  Lynn would not compare the severity of the current case with Morris',
saying that "each case is different."

  Lynn said the virus, called "MBDFA" was put into three Macintosh games --
Obnoxious Tetris, Tetriscycle and Ten Tile Puzzle.

  On Feb. 14, the games were launched from Cornell to a public archive at
Stanford University in Palo Alto, Calif, Lynn said.

*< I guess these guys actually put it up on the archive under their own   >*
*< accounts! Don't they know they can trace that stuff? duhhh...          >*

>From there, the virus spread to computers in Osaka, Japan and elsewhere
around the world *< the archive was a dumb idea if thats how they got caught,
but it spread like hell >* when users connected to computer networks via
modems, he added. It is not known how many computers the virus has affected
worldwide, he explained.

  When computer users downloaded the infected games, the virus caused "a
modification of system software," *< oooh...lets not get too technical >* Lynn
said. "This resulted in unusual behavior and system crashes," he added.

  Lynn said he was not aware of anyone at Cornell who reported finding the
virus on their computers.

  The virus was traced to Cornell last Friday, authorities were quickly
notified and an investigation began, Lynn said.

  "We absolutely deplore this kind of bahavior," Lynn said. "We will pursue
this matter to the fullest."

  Armed with search warrants, Public Safety investigators removed more than
a dozen crates full of evidence from the students' residences in Baker and
Founders halls on West Campus. *< sounds like a typical, over-kill bust to
me.  If you don't know what it is, take it. >*

Public Safety officials refused to disclose the contents of the crates or
issue any comment about the incident when contacted repeatedly by phone last
night.  *< thats because they don't know what the fuck the stuff is >*

  "We believe this was dealt with very quickly and professionally," Lynn
said.

  The suspects are scheduled to appear in Ithaca City Court at 1 p.m. today
and additional charges are pending, according to Grace-Kobas.

  Because spreading a computer virus violates federal laws, "conceivably,
the FBI could be involved," she added. Officials with the FBI could not be
reached to confirm or deny this.

  Blumenthal and Pilgrim, both 19-year-olds, were current student employees
at Cornell Information Technologies (CIT), Lynn said. He would not say
whether the students launched the virus from their residence hall rooms or
>From a CIT office.

  Henrik N. Dullea '61, vice president for University relations, said he
thinks "the act will immediately be associated with the University," not
only with the individual students charged.

  Because a major virus originated from a Cornell student in the past, this
latest incident may again "bring a negative reaction to the entire
institution," Dullea said. *< "blah, blah, blah" >*

  "These are very selfish acts," Lynn said, referring to the intentional
distribution of computer viruses, because innocent people are harmed.

  Lynn said he was unaware of the students' motive for initiating the virus.
Lynn said CIT put out a notice yesterday to inform computer users about the
"very virulent" virus. A virus-protection program, such as the new version of
Disinfectant, can usually cure computers, but it may be necessary to "rebuild
the hard drive" *< egad! Not the dreaded "virus-that-makes-you-rebuild-your-
hard-drive" !>* in some cases, he added.

  A former roommate of Blumenthal said he was not surprised by news of the
arrest. Computers were "more than a hobby" for Blumenthal, said Glen Fuller
'95, his roommate from last semester. "He was in front of the computer all
day," Fuller said.

  Blumenthal, who had a modem, would "play around with viruses because they
were a challenge to him," Fuller said. He said that, to his knowledge,
Blumenthal had never released a virus before.

               New Virus on Macintosh Computers: MBDF A

February 25, 1992, 1130 PST                                 Number C-17

________________________________________________________________________
NAME:     MBDF A virus
PLATFORM: Macintosh computers-except MacPlus and SE (see below)
DAMAGE:   May cause program crashes
SYMPTOMS: Claris applications indicate they have been altered; some
          shareware may not work, unexplained system crashes
DETECTION &
ERADICATION: Disinfectant 2.6,Gatekeeper 1.2.4, Virex 3.6,
             VirusDetective 5.0.2, Rival 1.1.10, SAM 3.0

                     Critical Facts about MBDF A

A new Macintosh virus, MBDF A, (named for the resource it exploits)
has been discovered.  This virus does not appear to maliciously cause
damage, but simply copies itself from one application to another.
MBDF A was discovered at two archive sites in newly posted game
applications, and has a high potential to be very widespread.

Infection Mechanism

This virus is an "implied loader" virus, and it works in a similar
manner to other implied loader viruses such as CDEF and MDEF.  Once
the virus is active, clean appliacation programs will become infected
as soon as they are executed.  MBDF A infects only applications, and
does not affect data files.  This virus replicates under both System 6
and System 7.  While MBDF A may be present on ALL types of Macintosh
systems, it will not spread if the infected system is a MacPlus or a
Mac SE (although it does spread on an SE/30).

Potential Damage

The MBDF A virus has no malicious damaging characteristics, however,
it may cause programs to inexplicably crash when an item is selected
from the menu bar.  Some programs, such as the shareware
"BeHierarchic" program, have been reported to not operate correctly
when infected.  Applications written with self-checking code, such as
those written by the Claris corporation, will inform the user that
they have been altered.

When MBDF A infects the system file, it must re-write the entire
system file back to disk; this process may take two or three minutes.
If the user assumes the system has hung, and reboots the Macintosh
while this is occuring, the entire system file will be corrupted and
an entire reload of system software must then be performed.

This virus can be safely eradicated from most infected programs,
although CIAC recommends that you restore all infected files from an
uninfected backup.
