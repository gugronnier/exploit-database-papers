Introduction -

This is a down and dirty zine on wich gives examples on writing viruses
and this magazines contains code that can be compiled to viruses.

If you are an anti-virus pussy, who is just scared that your hard disk will
get erased so you have a psycological problem with viruses, erase these files.
This aint for you.

                          - VIRUS SPOTLIGHT -

     The first virus I would like to spotlight is the Tiny virus, lets see
what our good friend Patti Hoffman (bitch) has written about it.

Name:        Tiny
Aliases:     163 COM Virus, Tiny 163 Virus, Kennedy-163
V Status:    Rare
Discovery:   June, 1990
Symptoms:    COMMAND.COM & .COM file growth
Origin:      Denmark
Eff Length:  163 Bytes
Type Code:   PNCK - Parasitic Non-Resident .COM Infector
Detection Method:  ViruScan V64+, VirexPC, F-Prot 1.12+, NAV, IBM Scan 2.00+
Removal Instructions: Scan/D, F-Prot 1.12+, or Delete infected files
General Comments:
      The 163 COM Virus, or Tiny Virus, was isolated by Fridrik Skulason
      of Iceland in June 1990.  This virus is a non-resident generic
      .COM file infector, and it will infect COMMAND.COM.

      The first time a file infected with the 163 COM Virus is executed,
      the virus will attempt to infect the first .COM file in the
      current directory.  On bootable diskettes, this file will normally
      be COMMAND.COM.  After the first .COM file is infected,each time
      an infected program is executed another .COM file will attempt to
      be infected.  Files are infected only if their original length is
      greater than approximately 1K bytes.

      Infected .COM files will increase in length by 163 bytes, and have
      date/time stamps in the directory changed to the date/time the
      infection occurred.  Infected files will also always end with this
      hex string: '2A2E434F4D00'.

      This virus currently does nothing but replicate, and is the
      smallest MS-DOS virus known as of its isolation date.

      The Tiny Virus may or may not be related to the Tiny Family.
      ^like she'd know the difference!

OK, Theres the run down on the smallest MS-DOS virus known to man.  As for
it being detected by SCAN we'll see about that.

Here is a dissasembly of the virus, It can be assembled under Turbo Assembler
or MASM.

seg_a           ends
                end     start

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Its good to start off with a simple example like this.  As you can see
what the virus does is use the DOS 4Eh function to find the firsy COM file
in the directory.  If no files are found the program exits.  If a file is
found it compares the virus id string (the virus jump instruction) to the
first two bytes of the COM file.  If they match the program terminates.
If they don't match the virus will infect the file.  Using two key MS-DOS
functions to infect.

The first -

INT 21h Function 42h
SET FILE POINTER

AH   =   42h
AL   =   method code
BX   =   file handle
CX   =   most significant half to offset
DX   =   least "                       "

If there is an error in executing this function the carry flag will be set,
and AX will contian the error code.  If no error is encountered

DX   =   most significant half of file pointer
AX   =   least "                             "

The second (and most) important function used by any virus is

INT 21h Function 40h
WRITE TO FILE OR DEVICE

AH    =   40h
BX    =   handle
CX    =   number of bytes to write
DS:DX =   segment of buffer

Returns

AX    =   bytes transferred

on error

AX    =  Error Code and flag is set.

An example of Function 40h is ----

     mov     ah,40h                   ;set function
     mov     bx,handle                ;load bx with handle from prev open
     mov     cx,virus_size            ;load cx with # of bytes to write
     mov     dx,offset write_buffer   ;load dx with the offset of what to
                                      ;write to file
     int     21h                      ;

This function is used by 98% of all MS-DOS viruses to copy itself to a
victim file.

Now heres a sample project -  create a new strain of Tiny, have it restore
the original date and time etc...

                                                                          HR

             -  HOW TO MODIFY A VIRUS SO SCAN WON'T CATCH IT -
                                   OR
                     HOW TO CREATE NEW VIRUS STRAINS


The problem with most viruses is that this dickhead who lives in California
named John Mcafee gets his greedy hands on them and turns them into big
bucks -- for him.   John boy is the reason there are over 500 viruses out
there, and I wouldn't doubt if he weren't resposible for  writing at least
ten of them.

So the best thing to do to some Mcafee dependant sucker, or lame board is
this.

Say you have a copy of a played out virus, lets say an older one like
Armstand or Jerusalem.  Almost every virus scanner can detect these
viruses cause they been around so long.  Now heres a quick way to modify
viruses so the scanners wont catch them, in turn making them new strains.

The tools you need are --

                          Norton Utilites
                          Debug          and/or
                          Turbo Debugger by Borland

Now heres what you do.

Step A
------

Make a target file like this with Debug

Copy the below file with your editor to a file called SAMPLE.USR

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
n sample.com
a
int 20

rcx
2
w
q
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Then uses Debug to make the file SAMPLE.COM executing this command --

DEBUG < SAMPLE.USR

This will make a two byte called SAMPLE.COM

STEP B
------

Infect the file with the virus.  If this is a boot sector virus your on
your own.  Do whatever you have to to infect the two byte file.

Make a copy of the file and keep it for safe keeping.

STEP C
------

Load up DISKEDIT, which comes with Norton 6.0 (I'm not sure if its in the
lower versions) PCTOOLS Hex Editor will work too but it takes more work.

Now have DISKEDIT Hex-edit the infected file.

Now figure out where the middle of the file is.  Next put block on and
go to the end of the file.  At the end of the file go to the edit screen and
select fill.  Fill the lower half of the file will nonsense characters, its
good to select 255d (FFh) the blank character.

Now save your changes and go to DOS

Now use SCAN to scan the file for viruses.  If it detects the virus you
didnt delete the search string that SCAN is searching for.  Get it???

You see all SCAN does is search files for strings that are related to viruses.
For example if SCAN was looking for CASCADE it look for something like this-

                        EB1DAD1273D1FF121F

In every file you specify.  So what we are doing is narrowing down where that
string is in the virus that SCAN keeps finding.

So what you have to do is keep deleting parts of the virus with DISKEDIT
untill you finally narrow down the string.

Keep this in mind, search strings are in the first 150 bytes of the file
about 75% of the time.

Ok lets say you narrowed down the search string and lets say it's -

                      B8 92 19 B7 21 CD

It will most likly be longer but this an example.

Now back to DEBUG - Do the following--

DEBUG

E 0100 b8 92 19 b7 21 cd    -- this is the string you found

Then type --

U

This will give you a unassembled look at what the id-string is.  In this
example it was

                       mov  ax,1992h
                       mov  bx,21h
                       int  21h

Now this is what you have to do, and keep in mind the following ---

THE FOLLOWING TAKES A SOMEWHAT KNOWING OF ASSEMBLER AND HOW IT WORKS!!!!!!

Uses Turbo Debugger to find the string, you can use DEBUG but I don't know
how to do this from debug.

Ok say you got the string on the screen --

                       mov  ax,1992h
                       mov  bh,21h
                       int  21h

Write down the locations in the file where these strings are.  Ex 0100h etc..

Now rearrange the AX mov with the BX mov like this ---

                        mov bh,21h
                        mov ax,1992h
                        int 21h

You see?  You didn't change the way the code functions (THATS IF YOU KNOW
WHAT YOUR DOING!) but you changed the codes id-string for SCAN.

Now since Turbo Debugger dosent let you save the changes you must do it
via - Debug.

DEBUG virus.com

a 0122  - This is the address of the string

Now enter the assembler instructions --

                         mov bh,21
                         mov ax,1992h

Save it and SCAN it, if SCAN doesn't catch it Congrats.  If it does ---
back to the lab.  Oh well you get the point.

One warning, this only works with un-encrypting viruses, or on the
encryption mechanism of encrypting files (which will most likely be Scanned).

With that in mind, have fun.

Sub-Zero is a memory resident COM and EXE infector that is based somewhat on
on Jerusalem-B.  It is the ansestor to the virus Captian Trips
which at this time has not been nailed by SCAN.

Be carefull because this virus will most likly format you hard drive if you
run it on the wrong day.  One day of the year it will perform a HD format.
I think it's in June, hmmmm...  D-Day rings a bell.

As of Scan-77 this virus can not be detected by SCAN or F-Prot.
