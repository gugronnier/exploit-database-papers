             The Resume

 Subject: Jon Doe's Resume

 Jane,

 I received this resume from Mr. Doe in my e-mail
 this morning. He looks like a promising catch.
 He brought in several profitable sales deals
 at his last company, and helped raise profits
 by 70%. I think we could use someone like him.
 Could you do the usual checks for me before
 we call him?

 Thanks,

 Ted

 Sir,

 I did some checking on the Internet and here is
 what I came up with:

 WWW:
 ------------------------------------------------
 Mr. Doe has a personal web page detailing some
 of his hobbies, which include writing, boating,
 and dog breeding and showing. In his links
 section he has pointers to pages which cover
 these subjects, and, in addition, he has several
 links that point to various piercing and
 tattooing shops in the Greater City area.

 USENET:
 ------------------------------------------------
 Mr. Doe frequently posts to the following
 newsgroups:

 alt.sex.stories
 alt.sex.bondage
 misc.writing
 comp.infosystems.www.authoring.html

 According to these USENET posts, Mr. Doe had a
 book of erotica published in 1983 under a
 pseudonym.

 He also mentions an arrest for possession of
 a small amount of marijuana when he was 19 years
 old.

 In misc.writing and comp.infosystems.www.
 authoring.html, he engages regularly in "flame
 wars" with the denizens of these groups.

 PROFESSIONAL SOURCES:
 ------------------------------------------------
 According to Mr. Doe's references, he is an
 excellent employee, a self-starter, creative,
 and hard-working. A representative quote is that
 he "gets the job done, no matter what it takes."
 He is "friendly and intelligent".


 Please let me know if there is anything else I
 can do for you with respect to this project.

 Jane
