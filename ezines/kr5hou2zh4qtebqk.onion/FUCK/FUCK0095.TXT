                              Originality
                              -----------
 
        Is there any left? If so who has it. If so where is it. People
might argue that something is original if you think of it without anyone
helping you, or anyone influencing you. The way I see it, everyone has
their own definition of what the word "Original" actually means. Lets see
here.
 
orig-i-nal \(upsidedown "e")`rij(upsidedown "(e)")nel\ n : 
something from which a copy is made ~ adj 1 : first 2 : not 
copied from something else 3 : inventive --orig-i-nal-i-ty n 
--orig-i-nal-ly adv
 
Lets look at the first definition, "something from which a copy is made".
This means that if you make a Drawing and Jeff copies it, it is original.
It doesn't say that if Bob influenced you in making the drawing, and
Jeff copies it, it isn't original. BUT if you copy the drawing from Bob,
and Jeff copies it from you, its not original because of the third rule,
which states.
            
"Not copied from something else". If you copy something in anyway, a
picture, an idea, a shape, a form, it is not original. Well if you draw 
a circle, you are not being original. If you make a circle connected to 
a square then would you have something original(1)? or just two unoriginal
objects put together(2). This is where things get confusing. If you say
the second part, that means NOTHING is original if it can be connected
with anything in the past. But if you think the first part, then you think
that as long as what you created cannot directly be linked to something 
in the past it is original. Here is an example.
 
I just had a great idea. I am going to create a group called F.U.C.K. 
which stands for Funny Unique Comedian Kids. This group will be a 'Zine 
released whenever we want, and will be full with nothing but jokes and 
shit. 
 
Now, if you go by the second part, then you would think since the acronym
"F.U.C.K." has already been used it is un original, and look at the
words "Funny", thats unoriginal. So is "Unique", "Comedian" and "Kids".
Jezz people have been writing jokes for a long time, and there is nothing
original about a 'Zine.
 
So my new group is TOTALLY unoriginal.
 
Now, if you go by the 1st way, then you think that that is a pretty 
original group, because you have never heard of a group with that name 
before, or one that writes nothing but jokes. 
 
So we got that down. Well now lets see here. I will try and make my group
TOTALLY original. Straight out of my head. Once I have that down, I have to 
PROVE that it is in fact original, and here is how I would go about doing 
that.
 
-Create my group.
-Ask everything that has ever been able to think on and off this world. 
 Even if they are dead. If they had every heard of anything like my group 
 before. I would have to have different sounds, different ideas, etc..
-Make sure that once I ask someone if they have ever heard/thought of
 something like that, using any of those words or letters that they
 tell/talk to NO one of it.
 
Now, you all know that that is impossible (right now). So proving that our
group is truly original, is impossible.  Thus, the concept of originality
means that nothing is original until proven otherwise, so nothing is original
since you can never prove it is.

If you are thinking "Great, so nothing is original" I mean that in 
today's day and age nothing is original. To find something TRULY original 
we would have to go back to when the FIRST life in this or any universe 
or dimension had its first thought. That is the ONLY thing original. The
next thought could have been formed by the one he just had, making it 
unoriginal. And everything you see around you, has been developed from 
that one thought. Now, don't you wonder what that thought was? A sound? 
A shape? A taste? A feel? A smell? Who knows.. only one thing knows for 
sure, and that is most likely (99.99999999999999-->% chance) dead.
 
For all you people who just got pissed off reading this (mainly art
people). Instead of saying "100% Original art by <name>" you could 
always say "100% Out of the head of <name>", its like your almost saying 
the same thing.
 
! Rage !  -Call 800.831.0622, box #9998 if you want to leave me a 
message about anything.. Your views on one of my files, if you want to 
rape me kill me and throw me in a ditch, or if you just want to say hi.
