 #zines faq
 by, mogel (with eleet mods by orestes)

 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------

        first off, don't go on irc.  it's a disease of the pathetic.  it's
 intention of a place to pass bored time goofing around has been extended way
 past the normal - & its a literal LIFE for many modem warrior 'puter
 geeksters & socially 'tarded idiots.
 
        to note, #zines _is_ the hippest irc channel with the most
 personality, & its still annoying & pathetic.  if you've spent one hour on
 #zines, you've already had 98% of the experience.

        #zines was originally started by jamesy, bF, mogel, DisordeR, spiff,
 edi, morph, & pip in a fit of boredom.  it's focus (thanks to all of us
 being totally self-centered) is upon the relatively 'underground' e'zine
 scene, however we're open to all publications that fall under the definition
 of 'zines.  #zines is also a place where one can on VERY rare occassion
 discuss 'zines with their writers.  you can also pick up new releases on the
 channel.

 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------

        the general rules on #zines :
        =============================

  1. don't ask when the new dto is coming out.
  2. don't give morph an account.
  3. you don't have to be annoying to get attention.
  4. don't take a kick seriously, jackass.
  5. your npa is your passport.  908 people are eleet. 
  6. people to constantly invite to #zines :
        emmanuel, jasonf, erikb, sna, gweeds, y, sratte, veggie
  7. don't op metalchic.
  8. DON'T ask me to write for your 'zine. 
  9. don't tell people if you're suicidal.
 10. 95% of #zines girlies want to have sex with mogel.
 11. seriously, don't ask for the latest dto.
 12. make fun of loOpy/r3ptile, for he is the epidome of the modem
        warrior / #ansi geekster.
 13. don't ask teletype for a prism.net account.
 14. the "i phear mogel" joke is dead.
 15. don't make fun of mercuri.  he's sensitive.
 16. hal08 is a homosexual.
 17. about 75% of #zines is all groupies that never write.
 18. gasp sux, hoe roolz!@
 19. tut is a bot.
 20. dem0nseed elite (see cDc #200) is very real.
