        At first it was laughable.  Guffawable even, a "point at it and
bellylaugh" phenomenon.  As time passed, it became a chuckling matter,
and "at least *I* know better" giggle.  Now I am insulted, and you should
be too.

        People are terrified of us, that much is clear.  And I'm not
sure I like it anymore.  It used to be a good feeling, to be able to sit
down at a keyboard and "fix it" while awestruck computer fools kowtowed
and offered money and prizes.  It was admirable to know what you were
doing at the keyboard, like you possessed some sort of magic that was rare
and wonderful.  Now we are all being burned at the stake by journalists,
movie makers, and talk show hosts, and the witch hunt is far from over.

        It began, rather innocently, with a movie about a little kid
who hacked NORAD and started a globalthermonuclear war.  _Wargames_ had
America thinking "Get a little geek behind a keyboard and he can kill us
all."  But they laughed and they liked it, and hell, so did we.  Then came
_Sneakers_, another hacker flick with a good, entertaining plot.  America
liked this one too.  The hackers helped those NSA guys in the white hats
and were given money and prizes for their wizardry.  But still, there was
that nagging paranoia - America thought "Can people *really* do this stuff?"
But everything was still OK.  We were still wizards and America was still
computer ignorant.  So all was well.

        But then things began to change.  The Internet grew up.  PCs were
becoming more standard, a part of the family.  Commercial online services
exploded.  And hackers made more and more headlines.  Suddenly we weren't
wizards anymore.  Commands turned into rodents, DOS turned into Windows,
and the Internet became America's playground.  What did America need the
wizards for?  Burn them.

        _The Net_.  Evil computer people got poor Angela's information and
killed her cyberfriends all because of a stupid little icon that
automatically hacks government systems at random.  _Copycat_.  A serial
killer uses computers and the Internet to stalk a poor housebound
expert on serial killers.  _Hackers_.  A bunch of kids that look like
fools "get the bad guy" after they destroy a Secret Service Agent's life.
Coming soon on NBC.  _Deadly Web_.  A poor young girl is stalked online
by some computer guru using e-mail and chat.

        I see a pattern forming.  If you can use a computer, you are either
an unsuspecting victim or an evil computer wizard.  Now, most of you are
thinking that this is only the movies, that none of this has no bearing
on real life.  Ok.  Let's look at the media.  There are two types of
computer coverage on the news and in the papers.  There is the new technology
coverage, including software, hardware, and company news.  Then there is
the "cyberporn ring caught" coverage.  You know the type.  This hype allowed
the editor of Time Magazine to publish the results of the Rimm study,
later found to be improperly executed and reported.  This hype allows
the media to report improper and incorrect information on a daily basis.
Take the cyberporn ring busted on AOL.  Every article I saw about that
said it was an "Internet ring".  Now, the last time I checked I couldn't
use AOL services without being a member.  Does the media care?  I have
seen incorrect information published about people I know.  Does the media
care?  And let's not forget the CDA.  I did not see *one* reporter
mention the fact that the CDA could be unconstitutional until President
Clinton himself said that it was.  Does the media care?  Nope.  Burn them.
Burn the wizards.

        And now the talk-shows are taking the reins.  Mike n' Maty spent
an entire week featuring the Internet.  There was the inevitable story
about the two innocent teens that were abused in e-mail by cyberperverts on
the Internet.  Where did it really happen?  In an AOL chat room.  How do
I know that? Not because Mike n' Maty said so.  Because I watched the
little innocent teens chat in an AOL chatroom.  I have seen topics
ranging from "I was kidnapped by an Internet guy" all the way to "I met
my boyfriend online and he was married".  Again, the pattern is apparant.
Nothing good comes from computers, because the wizards abuse them.  Burn
them.

        When are we going to see the stories about the kids who *learn*
on the Internet?  The paralyzed guy who falls in love on IRC and gets the
girl?  The people who share resources and ideas on the Internet?  The books
that are written?  The services provided?  I think I know.  Burn them.
