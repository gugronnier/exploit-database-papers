                                Flying High
                                -----------

Well, I am off on a "glorious" vacation to the sunny Hawaiian Islands.  Ten
years of saving frequent flyer miles and stuff like that.  Sounds like fun,
eh?  Well so did I.  Unfortunately, there was one thing I seemingly
overlooked: The plane flight.  Seven hours, crammed in a tight space with 
some of the stupidest people on, (or off) earth.  We get on the plane in 
Denver, en route to San Francisco, where we will refuel.  

The second I get on the plane, I knew I'd have a grand 'ole time.  Heh.  On 
my way to my seat (in the back of the plane of course), I was tripped several 
times, and yelled at several more.  It was tight.  Arriving at my seat, I 
found that some yuppie businessman was occupying it.  No problem, I'll just 
ask him to move.  Well just as I open my mouth to ask him to leave, he picks 
up the AirPhone (cellular telephone in the back of every seat).  He slips his 
credit card through, and begins chatting with his yuppie wife.  After about 
five minutes of waiting and being tormented by the people wishing to get 
through, he finnaly hangs up.  "Is there anything I can do for you?"  Of 
course there is you asshole, get the hell out of my seat and go die.  In 
nicer words of course.  Well, he responds, "Oh, I am sorry, this isn't 33B?".  
"No," I replied, silently thinking of all the ways I could implode his head.  
Grinning that stupid ass yuppie "I'm better than you" grin, he gets up and 
leaves.  Not before "nudging" me into the couple in front of me.  Accidently 
of course.  Arg.

Well I decided to go to sleep and listen to my DiscMan, to put myself out of
my misery.  About 3 minutes after I am settled, I am awakened by a flight
attendant and told, "That in the event of an emergency, they will need to be
able to get ???my full attention.  Will you please (that damn grin again) remove
your headphones and turn off your DiscMan?".  How stupid can you be?!?  They
must have really have no life if they feel the need to bother me about crap
like that.  Yeesh, if the plane goes down, I think that they will have my 
full undivided attention whether I have my head phones or not.  After
notifying the stewardess of this, I was told that I could be fined a maximum 
of $5,000 if I did not take them off until 20 minutes into the flight.  What
some people will do for kicks.

After our refueling and transfer stop in San Francisco, I found myself
surrounded by "fresh blood".  All eager to piss me off, I'm sure.  I was
right.

In front of me was a family from Bangladesh or some other God awful place 
like that.  They spoke absolutely no english (of course not, isn't that a 
requirement for Asian tourists?).  Every couple of minutes I was cussed at in
some foreign language for who knows what.  As it turned out, my bag under
their seat was bothering them in some way.  Fuck them.

On my left and right resided my family.  Three younger brothers, mother, and
grandmother.  You know how that crap is, so I won't even go into that.

Behind me was one of the most self-centered chicks that I had ever met.  She
immediately "reclined" in her seat and planted her feet squarely on the back 
of my chair.  This forced me to remain in absolutely upright in a very
uncomfortable position.  (BTW - The idiots from Taiwan or wherever decided 
that this was the perfect time to "recline" as well, leaving me about 1 1/2
feet of room).  Pissed off, I pushed my seat back, "upsetting" the bitch 
behind me.  The same damn stewardess was called, and with that stupid grin on
her face told me to sit up.  Nothing was going to change her mind, and I was
forced back into my previous position.  About 10-15 minutes later, as I was
writing this file, I was again yelled at by the same damn whore behind me.
She told me that I was too tall, and I was blocking her view of the movie.  I
replied by saying, "Too bad bitch."  This got a surprised look, but 
recovering, she called the same stewardess, and I was now lying down.  She
got her way again.  Made me wonder about her and her special "friend" of a 
stewardess.  But anyway...

When riding any public transportation (bus, plane, train, etc...) don't be an
ass.  Other people have the same rights you do, and they paid just as much to
get there.  You have no right to take away from their right to ride whatever
you are on in comfort.  A packet subway car, or tight bus seats are excluded,
seeing that everyone is not feeling good, but in the case when you have that
right, so does everyone else.  Don't be a moron and act anything like the
above people.  If you thought that any of that was cool, I hope you die in 
a plane crash or whatever.  With that damn grin on your face...
