                         3 Easy Steps to Getting Laid
                         ----------------------------

If you've never read a FUCK file in your life good. You are just the person
I sought to gain attention. You downloaded this because it had to do with
sex. Sex, the ultimate manipulating tool. If not for sex people might be
more open mided, even more intellegent. It is in everyone's genetic makeup
to have a desire for sex. However, since many know this, it is highly used
as a form of control. Don't get me wrong. I think sex is as kool as the next 
guy. However, I see the media and such enemies using it to lure us into
buying some lame product that will do us more harm than good. I'm just
tired of it. If you think what I'm saying is bullshit, just take a second
to look at everything from a third point of view. Lets take MTV. This channel
has about .00001 M in it now a' days. They now have comedy, Sports shows,
Game shows, Soaps (The Real world), and loads of other bullshit. Whats the
big deal you say? They are a primary influence on Generation _ (thanks
Rage). They have no competition. Some of us have left TV entirely. However,
as computers are still not as affordable as a TV, people still have to use
tv's as their primary entertainment source. Who can blame them, today, you
goto a mall, get shot for bumping into someone. Which would you rather do?
        Anyways, back to my point. On MTV, not only do they show the same 
lame ass videos with someone singing a song some creative artist made 20 
years ago, but they play those videos about 89324723323683 times a day 
(imbetween their excellent specials of course) Almost all of these videos 
have something in common. Sex. Look at most rap videos today, they have  
several things in common; 40 ounces, cars that hop, guns, and of course
sex.Now, you can't be a gansta without all of them, but you can still be a
rapper if you have the sex. If you think this is limited to rap think
again. Most of the female artists use their sex to gain attention to their
videos. Also many rock videos that have very lame music will have a young
pretty girl in them to gain everyones attention. Using sex to sell has worked
since the beginning of time, I have just never seen such abuse of it before.
Even in todays movies, to be a drama you have to have a sex scene. Normally
they will base a whole movie around such scenes. Thats what PORN is for.
Yet society makes purchasing such items (porn movies/mags whatever) a
forbidden act. Like most of things in society we are just being
hypocrites. Answer to the problem? Well.. I'm not sure there is one.
None of todays problems are simple, but most people have an opinion on
them. I can't get this one. If you feel you can, email me somewhere 
enlightening me. 

        Until then, fuck the government, fuck school, fuck control.
