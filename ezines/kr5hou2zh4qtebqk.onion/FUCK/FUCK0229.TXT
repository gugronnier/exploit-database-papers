                            Death Isn't A Hobby
                            -------------------

     I was just booting my computer up to try and work on another 
file for F.U.C.K. when a story came on the news about a kid who was
seriously injured when he found a homemade bomb in his friends backyard.
     Apparently his friend had downloaded the bomb plans off of a 
local BBS and had built it just for the fun of it. He then left it
lying behind his house and forgot about it until his best friend found
it, picked it up and accidentally detonated it. According to the report,
the bomb blew off 3 of his fingers, blew a hole through his cheek and
severely damaged his ear drum.
     Of course there was a big deal made about WHERE the information 
came from. And the kid that built the bomb was on the show. He 
demonstrated how he signed onto a BBS and then downloaded a file detailing
how to build a bomb. Then it showed him scrolling through DOS Edit,
pointing out how the file explained what was needed to build the bomb,
how to go about obtaining these supplies and finally step by step how to
build the bomb.
     K2 wrote a file similar to this back in F.U.C.K. #163, but 
hopefully I can move in another direction to compliment his views. As
usual, I really have no idea where I'm going so bear with me if I begin
to ramble.
     He goes on to say "Right here it says that it's for 
informational purposes only but then they explain step by step how
to do it." He never once said anything to show any remorse...never
apologized to his friend or admitted that he made a mistake. He basically
blamed the whole thing on the BBS.
     The news anchor then went on to warn parents not to let their 
kids get into a situation like this and if they suspected their kids of 
getting involved in something dangerous, that they should just ban them
from the computer.
     As a final note just before breaking to commercials, the host 
made a short note that this information wasn't just available on the 
computer but in fact similar items have been available in the public
libraries for decades. But by then, it was not enough, too late. Any
parent that wasn't at least somewhat experienced with the Internet had
it set in their mind that if they let their child use the computer to
"sign on", they would blow up half their block. I wouldn't be suprised
if at least one kid got banned from AOL or Prodigy because of all the
"dangers" that lurk there.
     I'm not sure what pisses me off the most about this whole thing. 
Whether it was how they placed the blame on the computer or how there
was no mention of the kids stupidity. They made it seem like there was
nothing wrong with him building the bomb because of the fact that it
was on a local BBS. I'm kind of curious to see what would happen if
someone were to print out one of these bomb plans and pinned it up on
a Bulletin Board in a classroom at school. Would the computer still get
blamed even though the person that finds the plans and kills himself
trying to follow has probably never used a computer?
     I know that in my old high school, bomb plans and other anarchy 
related items were prominent. One kid even had a complete book of explosives 
and pyrotechnics that his brother stole while on duty with the Navy. My 
friends and I also used to make "M-80s" by packing gun powder into pill 
bottles. And after the Oklahoma City bombing, 2 kids got in-school suspension
for trying to build a bomb out of gasoline and matches.
     None of the above listed events had anything to do with a 
computer, and luckily, no one ever got hurt. But the situation would
have been no different had we had access to on-line information.
     After I graduated, I went on-line and was assaulted with the 
vast array of underground information. I downloaded several files containing 
bomb plans. I took these back to my hometown and we tried a few of these
out, but possessed the one attribute that can be your greatest asset while 
doing any potential deadly projects. We had the intelligence to realize we 
could get seriously injured if we fucked up and we had fear of blowing our 
fingers off. As a result, we stuck to making simple tennis ball and drain
cleaner type bombs. Relatively "safe" bombs that were enjoyable to watch
detonate.

     We never made a pipebomb because there was no reason to. We 
weren't terrorists. We had no desire to kill anybody or destory anything. If 
you want to kill a bunch of people, then build a pipebomb. If you want to 
blow up your school, then build a pipebomb. If you're bored, then get 
another pasttime. Flirting with death isn't a hobby, it's just stupid.
