these seem familiar to you? After reading these definitions, take time
to read a few select quotes about various aspects of life. With these
two steps, put 2 and 2 together and see what you get out of the file.

Final thoughts...
-----------------

As I write this file, I can't help but wonder to myself if anyone
will get the point. I find myself doubting that people will actually
read through and consider the definitions and quotes. I have been
sitting here for over ten hours researching quotes that I feel help
reflect my point. But that just leads me to wonder what my point is.
I mean, I know what my point is, but I don't think I can adequately
reflect it through my own words. Furthermore, I know that it is
possible to get a double meaning out of some of these quotes. So I
am trusting you to make the right choice in trying to decipher my
meaning.

I think the best bet is for you the reader to think about things yourself.
Draw your own conclusions based on the text above. After all, your own
thoughts are the most powerful message I can deliver.
