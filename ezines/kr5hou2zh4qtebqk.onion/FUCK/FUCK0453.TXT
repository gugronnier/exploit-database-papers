                         the fates
                         ---------

 henry jones was a lucky man. great job, three smart kids, adoring
 wife. he had his life all planned. college for the children, then
 a long, healthy retirement in boulder, colorado. it was perfect.
 he knew it would be.

 but things began to go wrong. his sweet little janey got caught                             smoking pot at school. tim, his youngest, was diagnosed with
 attention deificit disorder and a learning disability. and chris,
 a senior in high school, shot himself in the head on christmas
 eve. his wife started to drink heavily, and the bedroom shades
 stayed closed until noon every day. the bed - well, the bed was
 just closed.

 he was laid off in august, on a particularly steamy day. he only
 had 2 weeks severance pay and his retirement savings to keep his
 family going. worse, he had to admit his wife into rehab at the
 tune of 18oo bucks a day, which meant that he had to hire a
 babysitter every day while he was job hunting. money was running
 out fast, and boulder was rapidly becoming a long-lost dream.

 early one afternoon, after an interview, he sat at his kitchen
 table, mutely glaring at the cat, who had developed cancer and
 was wheezing unhappily on the floor. the phone rang.

 "what?"

 "henry.."

 "yes, dad, what can i do for you? i am kinda busy right now, and.."

 "henry, your mother was killed in a car accident today. i need your
 help making funeral arrangements."

 henry swallowed.

 "sure, dad. i will be over early tomorrow."

 henry quietly hung up the phone and looked at the cat again.
 unfortunately, during his brief conversation, the cat had finally
 died. he sighed and gently took the limp body to the backyard to
 bury it.

 what had gone wrong? where had all of this bad luck come from?
 what had he done to deserve this? he didn't know, but he wished his
 luck would change.

 a few days after his mother's funeral, henry's house was broken
 into. every piece of electronics he owned was gone. it turned out
 that his daughter's friends were the the perps, and she was implicated.
 this meant court, which meant lawyers he could not afford. sadly,
 he told his daughter she would have to use a public defender, and
 he quietly shut himself in his bedroom.

 a few weeks later, the phone rang again. this time, it was one of
 his employment prospects telling him he had a job. he was thrilled.
 finally, something had gone right. he got in his car. it was winter
 now, and the roads were icy. henry lost control of his car and smashed
 into a tractor trailer. he was killed instantly.

                                 ***

 three women sat around an ancient marble table. they passed around a
 single eye, each one of them examining a golden scale that sat in the
 center of the table. one of them placed a weight onto the scale and
 passed the eye to the woman next to her, who looked into a small crystal
 encrusted in the scale. she watched henry smash into a tractor trailer
 and giggled.

 "oops".
