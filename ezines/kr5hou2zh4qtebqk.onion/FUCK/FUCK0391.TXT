                  How Do They Do it? [Part II in the series]
                           "Nerds Are Artists Too"

	"Man, I wish I could do that," was all that was going through my 
mind as I listened to my car stereo do an injustice to some vintage Eddie 
Van Halen guitar on the radio. "He plays the guitar like it's part of his 
body," I thought as my car floated down the road. I began to wonder what 
it would be like to be a musician like that. At first, I thought it must 
be tough to crank out those notes and near impossible to do the solos from 
the cuff, but then I realized something. Not only does it sound natural 
when most professionals play music, it looks natural, it is natural! Most 
of these guys have been playing their instruments for almost as long as I 
have been using a computer. When they sit down to play, they just do it, 
their fingers and bodies are on autopilot and they are, at any one moment, 
three steps ahead of where they are going and have no reservations or 
fears about getting there. 
	I began to realize that this all sounds awfully familiar until I 
began to complain to myself that I had quit playing drums at 13 and guitar 
a year later. Feeling empty because I really don't participate in any 
traditional artistic expression, I realized where I had felt the same 
natural feeling doing something, the computer. When I sit down to a 
terminal, I feel at home. The keyboard feels natural to me and my fingers 
know their way from the escape key to the numeric keypad like a pianist 
knows the keys of a piano. When I sit down to program or to simply peruse 
a UNIX system. I know where I am going and when my finger start typing, 
they know their way and the path they are going to take to get there.
	So how is this art? Well Merriam Webster defines art as art(n): 1 
: "skill acquired by experience, study, or observation" and "the conscious 
use of skill and creative imagination.." Under these definitions, being a 
computer nerd like myself IS an art. As far as creativity, look at all the 
different ways one program can be written, or look at Linux, the 
culmination of many different artists on one project (a project still in 
development I may add :) ). 
	So where's the glory? Where are my thin, large busomed, blondes 
wearing thongs that eventually end up on stage? Why doesn't anyone ask me 
to program in front of hundreds of thousands of screaming fans? Well, for 
the most part, we're just the unsung heroes of the next generation. Granted 
there are stars like Bill Gates, and Steve Jobs, but they are the Elvis's 
and Michael Jackson's of our time. The real stars have yet to shine.
	So keep those keyboards clean, practice and learn, soon we will 
all get the recognition that we deserve.
