                Land of the Priceless
                ---------------------

What is the American Way?
Or better yet, what is the American Dream?
And if I sing the National Anthem out of key,
will I go to Hell? Or is Heaven for sinners?
What is the American Culture?
Who really is Uncle Sam and what did he do 
when he was alone with Betsy Ross? 
Is Baby New Year their child?
And what ever happened to Old Father Time
on his first date with Mother Nature?
And why are all those Native Americans
known as American Indians when they were first?
Shouldn't we be whatever name they gave this land?
And did George Washington chop down a Cherry Tree,
and does it really matter? He owned Slaves.
And did Abraham Lincoln want to free the Slaves,
or did he just want his name in the History Books?
And when he walked on the moon, did Neil Armstrong
get an Erection from the cold wind slapping at his Groin?
And what is our preoccupation with Sex being equal to Love,
when all we really need is some Freedom and some Peace.
But someone killed the important Men, and many Women
are being suppressed and they let the Idiots run free.
Don't live in Glass Houses, but stay under Glass Ceilings.
Where is the Logic, the Reality, in shutting down desire?
Finish the Food on your plate because someone, somewhere
has nothing to eat but their Pride, and there's not much left.
And what about all the Poets and Artists who feed on pain,
and what about the Prisoners who feed on tax money.
What about the Students who learn how to enrich Hatred,
and how about those Athletes who break a leg and still get paid?
And when the Millennium comes, I'm going to celebrate
all the truths about Aliens, Mystic Cults and the Armageddon.
But it won't be Jesus coming back to Save all the Sinners
because what we all really need is the Wizard of Oz.
And in the Last Minutes of our lives, we all Smile at memories,
and we all sing our Favorite Song to die with tears in our Eyes.
And when I Stop Breathing, I want them to play a Fast Tune
to remind me that Patience is a virtue, and Truth is a friend.
