                                 Get Lost!
                                 ---------
                                      
   I went to the movies last night. Every trailer shown prior to the
   start of the movie had a website, complete with a domain name to match
   that of the movie. Afterwards, I flew home to San Francisco. I read
   the airline magazine. They had a website. In fact, so did almost all
   of the advertisers. The subway I took from the airport had a website.
   The place I ate dinner at had a website. The bookstore I went to after
   dinner had a website. The club I went to had a website. I just found
   out that even the fucking Pillsbury Doughboy has a website being
   advertised on TV. Can I go anywhere or do anything without having a
   URL thrown at me?
   
   The World Wide Web has become the death of the Internet. Every company
   feels it is imperative to have a presence on the web. I mean,
   afterall, they have shit they want to sell you. (And I do mean shit!)
   And every two-bit loser in the world feels compelled to go to a local
   bookstore and buy a book, or three or four of them, named something
   along the lines of "Learn to Build a Web Page in 15 Seconds" and then
   run home and throw their useless shit onto the Internet.
   
   But it doesn't stop there. Then all of these people feel it is
   absolutely necessary to tell the whole world to come visit their new
   creation with a fervor that matches the second coming of the almighty
   himself. I just opened my inbox for the first time in several weeks
   and found eleven messages along the lines of "Please visit my new web
   page."
   
   So what do I find if I do take them up on their request? Poor design
   and layout. Broken links, or nothing but links to other places, like
   to their favorite fucking pony web page or something else equally as
   lame. Childish animated JAVA applets that were stolen from other lame
   pages. No content even worth mentioning. People who haven't taken the
   time to keep thier site current. News Flash: Your commitment to a web
   site doesn't end after you upload it for the first time! Even worse
   are the jerk-off webmasters whose sites say nothing but "PLEASE BUY
   SOMETHING FROM ME WITH YOUR CREDIT CARD!" as the whole purpose of
   their existence.
   
   But the biggest complaint I have is that just about everyone who does
   build a web site puts NO FUCKING THOUGHT into it before they do upload
   it to the Internet. I am reminded of a sentence in a book on HTML I
   scanned briefly about two years ago: "Before you build a website, ask
   yourself one question: Why?" So simple it is almost poetic.
   
   So my web site is history. I no longer wish to be associated with the
   web and the scores of people who build useless shit and add to an
   already horrible bandwidth problem. The web is for children. Go do
   something else with your time. Learn something useful. A
   recommendation from my current reading list is "Applied Cryptography"
   by Bruce Schneier. Read it. Learn it. Master it. And once you do, oh,
   but I forgot, you won't. You'll continue typing in URL after URL in a
   vain attempt to find something useful on the web. Sure there are some
   useful sites out there. But how many versus the whole? When, and if, I
   ever find something useful to warrant putting up a web site again, I
   will. Until then...
   
   So, until you close your browser window, you will always be nothing
   but a useless piece of shit to society.
   
                                      
                                  [INLINE]
                            people have nothing
                               better to do!
