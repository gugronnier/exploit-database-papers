        Well there you have it. Probably one of the most true and meaningfull
things a band has ever said. "Because i'm alive." I found one of my old tape
mixes from a few years ago, and i was playing it just for fun. And when i got
to this, it just suddenly hit me how much we need to make it a part of our
lives.
        Society today says "why cant we all be equal" and "originallity
creates racism","blah blah" etc. It seems like our country is trying to
crush all of what makes us who we are.
        Schools say "hmm how can we make all our students feel equal?" so
they introduce dress codes, codes of conduct and crappy uniforms to make us
all feel the same. Things like that decrease morals, and incite rebellions.
But the rebellions are getting fewer and fewer. People start to say "who
really cares its just clothes." Next thing you know, the whole country will
be clockwork, everything running the same, everyone equally rich and equally
sucsessfull. Were all being herded in the same direction, the same way.
        My school started off as being more or less "democratic." Students
got opinions on school issuses, activities, what subjects they picked, what
they wore , etc. Then, the school decided to change the "student" council
into a "teacher" concill. Slowly, things that we had a say in deteriorated.
Our school introduced the "morally corect dresscode". In other words, no
shirts with "swears" or things promoting sex, beer, drugs, or cigarettes. No
hats, no ripped jeans, no shirts showing "shoulders" for girls , etc.
       Everyone complained, and the principle's answer was "this will make
us all more equal and appreciative of eachother". What a bunch of BULL.
And the sad part is, people say "eh, who really cares, we'll do what they
want". There letting society controll them. and therir hopelessly lost.
        So in my school, i go against the "laws". I wear ripped jeans, and a
hat. And when they say "you can't wear that or we'll call your parents", i
say "call my parents, their sensible enough to realize your crushing our
spirits". Then the teachers get a worried look in their eyes. "Could he
possibly be showing uniqueness?!?" so they send me to the principle, who
more or less tells me to "stop spreading my individualism".
        I was ready to follow him home and blow up his house. "Stop spreading
my indidualism?!?!" My principle is just another example of someone who wants
to end human civilization, by crushing all our originality.
        We must rebell against these factors that try to make us all like
them. If it risks suspension, punishment, etc, don't be afraid to speak out.
Our country's basis is freedom of speech, and thats one thing that they can't
take away from us.
        The population worries about being killed by a nuclear war, famine,
and other such problems our earth faces today. But global problems aren't
whats going to destroy us, but our lack as seeing our selves as Us, living
individuals. If We think that were are all one unit, instead of 6 billion
living, breathing, individual units, we will wither away.

                 We will not go quite into the night..
