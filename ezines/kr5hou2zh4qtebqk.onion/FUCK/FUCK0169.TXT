              The Freedom Of The Press Shall Not Be Infringed
              -----------------------------------------------
 
A free press is a vanguard to a free society.  In a free country, 
the press must be free to inform, and educate, the citizens about 
the workings of the government, so that abuses may be stopped, and 
good deeds may be applauded. 
 
It is impossible for every citizen to, on their own, investigate 
all the happenings in the world, so they must rely on the media to 
investigate and report on the issues and events that will affect 
the population at large. 
 
Ideally, the media should be motivated solely by the desire to 
report the events, as they happen and without bias, for the purpose 
of ensuring that the public will be well informed.  We have a free 
press in America, but we do not have such an altruistic press.  The 
media is motivated by a variety of factors, and it seems that 
keeping the public informed is the least important.  Profit must 
be, by far, the most important consideration.  Print what sells, 
televise what sells.  Because of their desire to create huge 
profits, the media has become highly competitive.  Competition can 
be a good thing but in this case, the public suffers.  In the hopes 
of getting a good lead on a story, the press is inclined to 
cooperate, and grant favors, to anyone who offers information to 
them.  If a police department spokesman, for example, promises a 
reporter an exclusive lead on a story, providing the reporter 
refrains from releasing information the police don't want released, 
well, it is nearly assured that the reporter will remain silent. 
 
It sometimes happens that the media suffers from overly-good 
intentions.  They are inclined to crusade for causes that are 
popular, whether or not they are well thought out.  And the media 
is completely unqualified to present most of the issues that it 
covers.  After all, they are reporters, photographers, writers, 
personalities.  They are not economists, scientists or engineers. 
It is hard, if not impossible, to present an accurate view of a 
situation, when the reporter really has no understanding of that 
situation.   
 
The media insists that they are "giving the people what they want." 
How many of you want hour upon hour of O.J. Simpson coverage, on 
a daily basis?  Didn't think so.  The media controls what is 
available, and the public takes what it is offered.  That makes the 
public responsible, as well, for allowing the media to get away 
with this.   
 
It is broken, and badly in need of being fixed.  The media will not fix 
their own problems.  It is unlikely that they even see that there is 
a problem.  We, the people, must become involved.  We must monitor the 
media, just as they are supposed to monitor the events that they report 
on.  We must educate ourselves, so that we can understand the issues 
and events that the media reports.  We must be vigilant, and speak 
loudly whenever we find the media to be abusing, either maliciously or 
thorough ignorance, their power.  We must force them to report facts, 
not agendas.  We must be tireless, and undertake this task as though 
our very liberty depends on it.  For it does.  Should we choose to allow 
them to continue to spoon-feed us, then soon we will have no desire for 
them to stop.  Nor will we have the power that will enable us to make  
them stop.
