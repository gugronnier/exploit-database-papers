                                GET A LIFE!
                                -----------

Ever hear anybody say that?  Most likly you have.  Maybe it was said 
directly to you.  Disappointing huh, yeah, I know the feeling.  I'm
sitting hear, quarter to eleven pm on a Saturday night writing this 
so its pretty obvious I've hear my share of "get a life."  But lets 
think about this for awhile before we put our heads down and walk away
without trying to defend "our" lifestyle.

Ever finish a weekend and go back to school or work and have someone
ask you "how your weekend was?"  Funny thing is you probably know each
other both well enough to know what the response will be yet it gets
asked nonetheless.  "How was your weekend?"  "Ahh, the ususal."  
"Anything exciting happen." "Naaw, how 'bout you?"  "Well, blah, blah..."
Some people really get into idle chit chat like this--I don't.

I understand this world is not black and white but I often categorize
people in the "night club" personality (i.e. preppie) or the "other"
personality.  The night clubers are often the very talkative "How was
your weekend" type.  They go to clubs, dance, drink, and do all that
preppie type stuff.  That IS their life.  If you do that "type" of stuff
then you HAVE a life too.  As an "other" I fit in at the opposite 
extreem of the night club person.  I only drink on rare occasions so
that keeps me out of said night clubs, bars, and such where drinking
is what is done.  I can be very social but never as much as a preppie.
They are almost too social...they kiss everyones ass.  Hell, if people
ask me a question I'm answering it truthful where the socialite will
do anything possible to NOT hurt your feelings.

Two extremes and then there is everyone else in between.  Drinking, 
smoking are both such a big part of the "night" scene--at least the
limited scene I have witnessed.  Reject either or both of these and
your night club "friend" will think you are an alien.  Yeah, get a 
life nerd.  

You have NO life according to them.  No bar scene drunk fuck talk life
that is.  Your life exists on a different level.  Computers...a life
or is it NO life to them.  It is no life to them because they do not
have the SOCIAL "touch" they require so much and get from the night
clubs.  Computers are alien to socialites while they become a life for
those of us who reject their lifestyle.  They ARE our life or some 
part there of.  They go to a night club for a couple hours, we use the
computer for a couple hours.  Different perspective, different life.

With a computer I can be more social than the socialite and it is EASIER
to talk to others from anywhere in the world.  For those of us who are 
withdrawn THIS lifestyle is our LIFE.  Having a life doesn't mean doing 
what OTHERS want or think we should do.  Having a life means doing what
we want and like to do.

Don't GET a life, you have a LIFE.  Everyone is different but if you want
to try their lifestyle then that is fine.  They want you to adopt their 
way of life huh, well, the door swings both ways.  See what they think
about adopting your way of life.  I always liked what Popeye said:  
"I am what I am."

Different strokes for different folks
