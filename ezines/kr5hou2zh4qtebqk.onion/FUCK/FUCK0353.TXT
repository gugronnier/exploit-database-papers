                         Do We Condemn Ourselves?
                         ------------------------

                         (Hypothetically Speaking)
                     An Answer to that Age-Old Cop-Out
     
          First off, know I am an atheist[and a Satanist, I will not
     bother explaining to those who don't understand in this article]--I
     don't believe in God.  The purpose of this essay is to show the
     nature of the Christian God concept, how flawed it is, how it
     cannot make sense.  Know from here on when I speak of "God" I am
     speaking in a hypothetical, "let's say he exists" sense.  
     
          The first thought that made me question the Christian God
     concept--"A loving god is not capable of condemning someone
     forever" is often responded with something to the nature of "We
     condemn ourselves.  God isn't responsible."  This is about the only
     defense towards God's vengeful nature.  That and, of course, "God's
     reasons are beyond human understanding."
     
          Here's an analogy--is an abortion doctor responsible for the
     "crime of abortion", or does it all fall on the woman?  Personally,
     I'm impartial regarding abortion and its "moral questions", but it
     seems most Christians are against abortion.  Most would say the
     doctor is "very" responsible--but the doctor doesn't make the
     choice.  The woman makes the decision "I will have an abortion",
     she is not forced.  [Once again, I am not condemning a woman who
     chooses abortion.]  Why should the doctor be held responsible?  The
     human makes the choice to "defy" god--to stop believing in him, or
     not to accept him.  The human indirectly might "condemn himself",
     but who actually sends the soul to hell?  God does the final act,
     I assume, for what sane being would say "I was a bad boy, therefore
     I will go to hell now."  People might attack this analogy by
     extending it--"But abortion doctors are evil!"--The question is
     indirect or direct responsibility, not good and evil--"God is all
     loving"--The point is not good or evil, remember--"God surpasses
     logic and analogy"--Assuming we believe in your God, and what kind
     of cop-out is that?  Your god must exist for me to be condemned. 
     He is responsible, it seems.  
     
          [Someone might say I'm twisting scripture, some might even say
     the vengeful nature of God is not to be taken literally.  Most of
     the error in the Bible is blamed on human error when Christians
     defend it, or on mistranslation.  But do you think a truly all-
     powerful God would "inspire" a book destined to be deceptive from
     the start?  And why would his divine word need to be twisted and
     corrected to make sense?  If all errors in the Bible are because of
     human limitation, then human twisting and contorting of scripture
     is just as prone to "error".  When the literal meaning falls out to
     science or common logic, hidden "occulted" meanings are searched
     for.  Give up already!  Genesis is a MYTHICAL STORY.  You don't see
     modern Greeks looking for hidden meanings in the old Zeus creation
     story!  Obsolescence is obsolescence!]
     
          AND WHY MUST CONDEMNATION EXIST?  Because God says so.  An
     omnipotent being doesn't *HAVE* to do anything!  And an
     omnibenevolent being could respond to any spite, smite, or defiance
     with calm and kind understanding.  Condemnation only exists because
     your God decided to make it so.  Humans don't hold power against
     your God, do they?  So it's not OUR FAULT, is it?  We didn't say
     "Now you must condemn us if we're bad."  Adam and Eve[this is all
     assuming these things existed/happened] did not know that defying
     god was wrong, did they?  They HAD NO KNOWLEDGE OF GOOD AND EVIL! 
     It seems man was damned from the start, under your creation myth--
     God makes man, God allows temptation of man, God punishes man who
     doesn't even know what evil is until he commits in.  Let's put it
     this way:
     
          Be Good.
          What is good?  And why must I be good?
          You do not know.  Be good because I am good, and I said so.
          Why do you say so?
          Because I will condemn you otherwise.
          Why must you condemn me?
          Because I have to.
          Why?
          Because I made it so, and because I said so.
     
          God puts forth the final act of soul-destruction.  God sends
     the soul to hell.  Condemnation is only necessary because God says
     so.  Why must it exist?  Because he says so.  Can you not see how
     INCREDIBLY INSANE THIS IS?  
     
          The conclusion: Your god cannot exist.  I know if I ever
     confronted him, I would not humble myself to him--I would kick his
     ass in a religious debate.  Stop searching for hidden meanings. 
     The Bible is obsolete.
     
          Update: Many times things such as "evil" and "bad things in
     general" are blamed on the devil.  Psycho Freak Jack Van Impe
     lately has been putting the blame on ALIENS, which are of
     course..LUCIFER'S ANGELS.  But go beyond that.  Who created this
     "Lucifer"?  God, being omniscient, knew his "angel of light" would
     fall.  Under an omniscient, omnipotent God responsible for all that
     exists[knowing the outcome of his creation] wouldn't he deserve the
     original blame for everything that could go wrong?  Question the
     concept of this "God", and think for yourself.  "Who knows God's
     reasons?" is nothing more than a cop-out that allows one to let
     someone else do their thinking.
