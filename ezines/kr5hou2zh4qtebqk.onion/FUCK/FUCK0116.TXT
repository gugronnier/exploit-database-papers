                               Corruptivity
                               ------------

        It's amazing how much corruptivity is out there in the world now-
a-days.  It pops up in places we don't want it to pop.  Take politics for
example.  Almost everyone in that whole genre of people is corrupt.  There 
is a reason for it, though.  Do you know what it is?  Money.  Money takes
people's emotions, twists them, and makes them crave money.  Money is like
a bad drug.  You get addicted after you buy your first candy bar.  People
look at money like family.  It's time I bear down and start raising some
hell.

        In this file, I will be naming off specific examples of
corruptivity, and going into depth about what they are, and what caused 
them to happen.  I will start with one we should all know, susan smith.
(Note: susan smith is not capitolized, because only proper nouns are
capitolized.  She is not one.  I capitalize it only in places where
grammar says I need to.)

        Susan smith was a horribly disgruntled parent.  That doesn't say
all that needs to be said, but it is a start.  She took her kids for a ride
to one of her friends house, only to decide that her kids belonged in 
a lake, rather than in her arms.  She strapped them in the car, and drove
it into a lake.  Then, she ran home and yelled "kidnapper" so that the entire
country would be at her mercy.  She even had a reliable description of 
the "person" who decided to nab her kids.  Of course, he was black, but I'll
get into that in another file all together.  I think she had many problems.
One was that she wanted media attention up the ass.  She never thought the
cops would search the lake she drove the car into, because who would 
question the "truth" about them?  The whole country belived that they were
in a car somewhere, driving to Pennsylvania or something.  She milked this
country into believing that.  This whole example shows something about what
we as the United States need to work on.  We need to be less gullible.  
Someday, someone is going to come along, and convince the country that he/she 
heard c-kret information from the president that he was going to bomb the 
united states.  And knowing us, many of us will belive him/her.  But, another 
side of this discussion needs to be brought out.  Susan smith ruined some 
peoples lives in the future.  Lets say a parent is driving along, and a 
person really does hop in, tell her to get out, and takes the kids?  Will we 
believe her? Oh no.  And we'll investigate her up the ass.  The kids will
never be found, and if they will be, then they will be in ditches.  Susan 
smith is one of the most corrupt persons in the world for these reasons, and 
we need to give her the chair.  I don't personally think kids are easy to
get along with, but killing them; hopeless, innocent, children, who never
got to experience life, is horribly stupid and corrupt.  

        I thought, after that brief opening on politics and corruptivity,
it might prove useful for me to go into more insight into the world of
money, sex, and power -- politics.  Have you ever wanted to just take
a poll of the people you work with to get you a raise at your job?  Have
you ever wanted to have any woman/man alive, by shoving money down their
pants?  If the answer is yes, then become a politician.  Money was swept
by their noses for just a moment, and they suddenly became hooked on
it.  They had to have more.  They had to have the power which we give to
our president/congresspeople/state representatives.  Communism is just 
slightly better, since in communism, at least they tell you that they
own everything you touch, everything you want, everything you "own". 
In Democracy, they seem to just jump over that point.  They think that
we already understand that, so we elect the most greedy people to the 
job.  I must admit, however, that the people in the government are very
slick.  They'd have to be, or we wouldn't keep re-electing them every two
or four years.  Look at some of the encumbents in congress.  One from 
Colorado, Pat Schroeder, has been in there for over 20 years.  She must
have money running out her face.  She is very good at covering her tracks,
but even when she did get caught bouncing a few checks, we still re-elected
her.  My god, if you were at work, and you bounced a few million dollars
on something you shouldn't have been been buying, with your business'
money, you'd get fired, and probably sued, right?   Not in politics.  You
can bounce millions of dollars, say you're sorry, and your "bosses" (us)
will re-elect you so you can screw us over again.  It's all about 
corruptivity, folks.  This corruptivity doesn't just stop with the people
we elect to office, it's also the people who work their way to get there.
ie: judges.  They are able to crush someone's life in a blink of an eye, 
and they do it, without a second thought, and without truly looking at 
the evidence at hand.  Sure, most of the time, he/she's right.  But what
about that margin of error which sends thousands of people to jail, or
makes them pay money they don't have?  Justice is non-existent these days, 
and the predominant reason is money.  I bet if we burned all the money
in the world, and collected all the seashells in the world, and changed
the currency to seashells, it would not stop this problem we have with
corruptivity -- it'd just be a little uncomfortable when shoved down your
underwear by the president.

        What about O.J. Simpson?  I like this guy, I used to think he was
totally hilarious when he was in movies or commercials.  I think the 
bastard did kill his wife, and it has to do with his corruptness.  He had
too much money, and he thought he, a big movie star, could get away with
murder, and he was wrong.  This is when justice finally jumps in and tries
to do something about it.  Hmmm, lets review the facts, shall we?  A woman,
O.J. Simpson's ex-wife, and her lover are found in their house murdered by
stabbing.  Their blood is found all over O.J.'s house, and car.  His 
blood is found all over his ex's house.  Gosh, what could've happened 
here?  I know!  O.J. was coming over to his ex's house to apologize for
yelling at her on the phone earlier, and she and Ron Goldman stab him with 
a needle, causing him to bleed.  Then, out of self-defense, he stabs them 
both with a knife, he just so happened to have bought that day, and was
carrying with him, just in case something happened to him.  C'mon, get
the facts straight.  He murdered them, all because he thought he could
get away with it.  But you know what?  The worst part of this entire
case is that no matter what the jury finds him, guilty or not guilty, 
he will appeal, and get away with it.  Why?  Because the system is all
fucked up.  He can plead a mistrial, and get off with a slap on the
wrist.  Suddenly, those who are corrupt enough can get away with murder.
What kind of message does that convey to the children?  It says it is
ok to murder if you get away with it, and that is the most corrupt thing
we can do to our country.  Destroy it with lies.  

        Corruptness, as a basic function, is not really about power, 
greed, money, sex, murder... It's about lies.  Lies that will affect
how people live years from now.  If susan smith hadn't snapped under
the pressure, she would've gotten away with killing her children. That
sends a chilling message to us.  If O.J. Simpson doesn't get convicted,
another chilling message will be sent.  I don't want to be around
when the shit hits the fan, if you know what I mean.

        I think that is enough for you all to chew on for right now, and
I hope you take what I've said here to heart.  I am sick of this 
corruptivity, and it's time it came to an end.
