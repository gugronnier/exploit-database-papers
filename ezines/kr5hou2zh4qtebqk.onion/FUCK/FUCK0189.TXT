                          Vigilante Justice
                          -----------------

        You don't hear about vigilantes much anymore. When you do,
you get to read a full page about how the police are trying to track
down the rogue figure, and stop him from taking the law into his own
hands. Even in cases where the vigilante is more effecient, and does
the job right, he is always tracked down, and his capture is put
in front of the criminals that he is removing from society.

        When you think about it, and read about past cases, you will
find that the ability to punish criminals without having to deal
with laws, paperwork, or office procedures, a law keeper becomes much
more efficient in his work. When I say 'law keeper', that means
either the legitimate police, or a vigalante. Instead of having a
single person working on a case, gathering evidence for a trial, filling
out paperwork, etc, he has the ability to go straight to the criminal
and act as the judge, jury, and executioner.

        The big debate comes in whether or not the average citizen
should have or take that ability. Police officers go through years of
training to do what they do, while a vigilante may skip that, purchase
a handgun, and kill someone he catches doing wrong. What gives that
person the right? Nothing. That is why police worry more about catching
the vigilante and forgetting about the real criminals.

        Given today's society and the direction it is heading, you have
to wonder if it is such a bad idea. Not so much the idea of a vigilante,
but the ability to skip through the paperwork and procedures, and just
worry about catching the bad guys. The only movie I know that implements
this idea is _Judge Dredd_ (which wasn't that good), but showed how that
kind of a system would work, and the potential of it. If a single police
officer has the ability to track, capture, judge, and execute, the law
enforcers become much more powerful, and much more deadly.

        For argument's sake, lets say the police had that power, the
primary concern becomes if the officer will abuse that power. Will s/he?
Yes. How do I know? A decent percentage abuse the power they are given
right now. What is to stop them from abusing the power if we give them
more? Stiffer punishment. Since the officer would have the ability to
enforce stiffer penalties, s/he would be subject to the same stiffer
set of laws. No more small fines for parking illegally, after the third
or fourth, they impound your car for a month. After the fifth or sixth time,
they impound it for three months.

        In this scenario, every crime would have a stiffer punishment
to help deter crime. Once people realized that they had no means of getting
out of the crime via common methods (messed up paperwork, officer not
showing, etc), they will be a little more careful of which crimes they
break.

        The only way to ensure purity among the officers would be to
institute new measures of tracking them. Bullets issued to the officers
would be ID'd in such a way that any recovered bullet could be tracked
back to the gun that shot it. More cameras on the police transportation
along with a microphone on the officer would help ensure honest judgements.
The recorded material from camera and microphone would be broadcast
directly back to internal affairs who would monitor the officers.

        If a citizen ever felt wrongly convicted or punished for a crime,
they could put a petition in at Internal Affairs, and a full investigation
would ensue. The system would be very difficult to implement, but once in
place would be a very effective deterent. The idea of running into a bad
cop alone would deter a lot of the criminals. Knowing you could be without
your car for three months would deter illegal parking.

        So vigilante justice is not the answer, and a total police state
isn't the answer. Something in between, but monitored strictly is the only
way it could happen. I personally don't think it could work, but it is
an intriguing idea. Parts of it would be a great value to society, while
other parts of this plan would put us worse off as far as the government
monitoring our lives.

        Who knows.. maybe that is where it will go in the future.. when
we have no say over the matter.
