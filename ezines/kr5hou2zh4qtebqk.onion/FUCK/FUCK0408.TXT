  half of the world watched Diana's funeral on TV. isn't this
mad? would it be possible to change the world system, by changing
half of the people who live in it? is it possible to manipulate
people over TV? wouldn't Diana's funeral have been a great possibility
for that?
  some people say it takes years until a society can change. or it
may take even centuries. but i disagree. i believe it is just one
moment that can make everybody, or the majority, realize what
they're living in, and that basically everything is wrong.
  why do people take it as it is, the family, people, or the
shareholders who own a company pay their workers just a few
percent of the money they earn. this is a fact today. but when
you really look at it, then it is just mad. it is the majority
of the people in the world, that work so that others, the rich
people can get even richer.
  what does the judge do, after a trial? s/he goes in a hotel
and has a good meal. while in the third world children die because
they don't have enough to eat. so the judge is an indirect murderer,
as s/he spends the money that is needed better elsewhere for useless
things. like about everyone today and always in the past.
  this is all old news. but just because it's old news, doesn't mean it's
wrong. do you like the society like it is now? are you happy with
your life? what do you need for life? can you be happy with a
religion, or with beliefs you get from books, for example new age
stuff? can you be happy without it? i don't know if i can, but i
feel i am better off without all this, as to me it's just bullshit.
  it may work for some people, and help them - but i pretty much
believe that it's just random...it's like if someone tells about
her feelings, she will most likely find a percentage of people who
can totally relate to it. that don't mean her feelings are wrong,
or right, or go for everyone. to compare such to a religion, means
all religions are wrong, or all religions are right.
  however, we live now. and society is cold. the ones who have
the power, politicians and economy leaders, abuse it. they don't
work for the benefit of everyone, they work to get more power,
to get acceptance by others who also have power.
  acceptance. power. believing. what stupid human needs these
are. self appointed experts trying to explain the world, and still
not getting anywhere. can anyone in the world prove, that there is
a god? can anyone in the world prove there is no god?
  we're losing the subject. but i don't care. so who gets listened to
in the world? the one who is loudest. the one who talks what people
want to hear. it's a mad world still.
  i want a change. i want to be able to live where i want to live,
to use any car on the street when i want to take a ride, i want
to be able to be creative, to work on my ideas, to write and to
live only for me. i cannot live having a normal job when i always
know that my job giver earns far more with me, than she pays me.
  i am not going to follow society rules. i have my own rules and
these rules are: doing whatever i want. and i feel there is billions
of other people who would like to live like that. i feel there is a big
need in this world for a change. does anyone agree to this? everyone who
does should make it happen. there is always a way.
  yeah, i don't feel like writing twenty files, i feel like putting
everything just in one. sometimes i think why people take their life,
and seem to accept it like it is. like those, who work 40 or 50 years
of their life, never really knowing what for or like 'the way is the goal'.
  i prefer to risk life time jail instead of walking that way. some
self appointed experts say the world, and everything, was built from
chaos. there couldn't be more chaos in my brain. and i hope i am not
the only one. we're not a generation. we are the future, it's in our,
it's in my, it's in your hands.
  if you need a change, then start today. i believe everyone is the same.
it's just a matter of how long one thinks about something. be creative
if you aren't already, and if you are be more creative. talk to others,
you will see many people think the same like you do.
