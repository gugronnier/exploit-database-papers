BOOKS

Sabotage in the American Workplace--Anecdotes of Dissatisfaction, Mischeif,
and Revenge
Edited by Martin Sprouse
ISBN 0-9627091-3-1
$12.00 US 
(Pressure Drop Press, P.O. Box 460754, San Francisco CA 94146)

This is one of the best books I have ever read.  All stories within are
true stories of how employees got back at their employers/bosses/etc. The
reading is intense, the stories are short and the layout is superior.  A
perfect book for those of us who lack the attention to read a Novel and are
only satisified when we walk away with some useful knowledge.  This is
a book everyone should own.


ZINES

IRON FEATHER JOURNAL
P.O. BOX 1905
Boulder, CO 80306-1905
$5 (published irregularly)

Steven Prothero has created 14 issues of Iron Feather Journal with issue
15 in the works.  Quoted as "lifestyles of the phun and phreaky" IFJ is
one damn good zine.  Stories range from scams and raves to internet and
hacking.  Layout is wild--to say the least--and information is plentyful.
This was the first underground publication I started reading--seven years 
ago--and one of the few I still read today.


What is it all about?  Information, that's what.  Each of these publications
will lead you to an interesting array of culture you probably never knew
existed.  It will also fill a void and keep you yearning for more of the 
same quality information not found in the mainstream.
