			Convictions?
			------------

	The sun had reached the height of its peaceful journey
through the heavens.  Several people milled about the streets,
relaxing and enjoying the lazy Saturday morning.  Two elderly
men sat outside the local barbershop discussing small town
politics, while a dog lounged on the step of the corner drug
store.  It was a common day in a common town.
	Slowly, the soft clatter of trotting horses arose from
the distance.  Down the dusty road appeared a small wooden wagon.
The lone rider wiped his brow as the horses made their way to the
town square.  He was a farmer from a plot just outside town.  His
dusty brown hair fell just above his eyes, while his soft brown
eyes scanned the town.
	Stopping in front of the county store, he dismounted and
watered his horses.  As he walked toward the store the golden cross
around his neck sparkled in the midday sun.  Reaching the cool
darkness of the porch, he opened the door and went in to purchase
supplies.  The two horses stood there ignoring the annoying flies
that attacked them from all angles.  A group of young boys
approached the resting horses with a handful of small noise
makers left over from the Fourth of July celebration a few days
before.  One of the boys flung them under the horses.
	 The explosions echoed through the street, shattering the
calm silence of the peaceful town.  Startled, the horses reared and
bolted down the dusty road.  The townsfolk gathered at the road
and watched in horror as the wagon traveled toward a deep ravine
just outside of town.  Hearing the commotion, the young farmer
threw open the doors of the store and ran after the escaping wagon.
With speed normally unknown to man, he chased the wagon and lunged
for the reins.  He grasped the worn leather and pulled himself
between the galloping horses.  The beasts continued their flight,
dragging their captor mercilessly along the gravel.  Nearing the
edge of the ravine and imminent disaster, the horses stopped as if
by some miracle.  But this gift was not without a price.  The horses
reared once and trampled the young farmer.
	By this time, the frightened people had reached the scene of
his death.  The sight of the unnecessary destruction saddened them.
Why hadn't he just let them go?  The wagon would have been destroyed,
and the horses wouldn't have lived, but his life would have remained.  
Why?  Why had he given up his life?
	A small whisper pierced the questioning silence.  A small
blonde head appeared above the wagon.  The answer had become clear.
He had died for his son.  He had sacrificed his life for someone he
loved...

	One of the reasons that our society is becoming so terrible
is the lack of commitment and meaning in our lives.  The farmer
depicted above set his standards by the way he lived and died.  He
knew that without the love and commitment that it took to stop the
charging horses, his son would have died without ever experiencing
life.  The same thing is needed in our lives as Americans.  We need
to stand strong for issues that we belive in.  We cannot tolerate
the immorality and the disrespect that we as Americans participate
in.  You watch MTV and see videos showing illegal acts and sexual
induendo.  You go outside and see people blatently disrespecting the
morals that we have been holding in our hearts for hundreds of years.
	In New York, I believe, a man boarded a subway train and
began to shoot the passengers.  The people on the train who had the
opportunity to stop him did not raise a finger.  If they had stood up
for life and morality, then perhaps several people could have
continued their lives.
	I guess what I am trying to say is that people have lost
their passion to be alive.  No one has any convictions any more.
We have lost any meaning to our lives.  If you can see what I am
trying to say, then do me a favor.  Help an old lady across the street.
If you see a woman struggling with shopping bags in a parking lot,
stop and help her.  Don't be cold and heartless.  Don't put up with
what the events that you see and hear that you know are wrong.
Be alive again.
