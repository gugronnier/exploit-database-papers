uh oh, I cant seem to fall asleep.....

So I will ramble about something that I think of often.  Something
everybody complains about, and might be too stupid to realize they can do 
something about it.  I mean, you always hear people complaining that 
their life sucks.  You hear it from your neighbor, on TV, on the phone, 
in IRC, maybe even through those lovely walkie-talkie intercepted 
cellular phone calls.  And people complain about everything under the 
sun.  They don't make enough money, cant get a job, have stupid kids in 
gangs or pregnant, have bad luck, hate their attitude, and/or their life 
is pretty much going to hell in a handbasket.  In other words, people 
pick on themselves because they aren't satisfied.  They aren't working up 
to potential and they know it (or they might not). I know I have the same 
problem, but I'm fixing it.  Some people don't even realize that they have 
potential, and that's the saddest thing of all.   When they cant even 
think for themselves.  When they don't realize their life is a mess 
because they let it get that way.  You have to know you can control it, 
work towards control, then maintain control.  Just like your weight.

A small example:  one might take this file I've written, point out the 
imperfections, and say you weren't working up to your full potential on 
this file.  There are fragments, run-ons, bad usage of grammar, and 
confusing sentences all over the place.

Well, I could take that criticism, feel bad, and never write a file again 
because someone tried to convince me that my writing sucks.  OR I could 
take that criticism and use it to my advantage.  If I actually cared 
about the imperfections, I would make it a learned habit to always have a 
mental note in the back of my head to strive to be that perfect  
writer.  To be able to churn out files like a literary genius.  So....I 
know this file isn't any thing to hang on the refrigerator and be proud 
of; I admit it but I don't apologize or get a bad-writer complex.  I don't 
care, cause these are just some ramblings.  It doesn't matter cause I know 
I can change; it's all in my head.  All I convince myself that I am 
capable of.   *I* know I can make it the best, but I'm trying to get 
everybody else to realize they can change themselves.

It is not very complicated or anything; on the contrary, really simple.  
Every belief you have is like a rule  (compare it to physics  :).  For 
instance, in a stable system every force has an equal but opposite 
force.  If a system does not have an opposite equal, then the system will 
move, causing a change.  An apple doesn't hang in mid-air but falls to the 
ground. Cause and effect.

Everything we believe causes some sort of effect.  If you believe people 
are evil, you will more than likely attract people with evil souls, and 
thus get your beliefs confirmed.  Then, to be able to change your life 
for the better and take responsibility for the way your life goes, you 
have to be clear on what your beliefs are and realize the effects your 
beliefs have.

This is really interesting.  A bit like programming - or hacking 
yourself!  To be able to realize the consequences of certain programs 
(beliefs) and be able to change them to get the desired effect.
Don't just give up on problems and say,  "Oh, there's nothing I can do about 
it."  REALIZE that you don't have to be stuck with being stupid and that 
you always have options.  In other words,

			HACK YOURSELF.

A pro is that you can't actually get caught, but some people will disaprove.
That is the greatest hack of 'em all.  Also the most worthwhile one.
