                           Cash, Check or Charge
                           ---------------------

        Three forms of payment today. Each one as fucked up as the
other one. Such a simple concept blown all to hell by stupidity.


        Check writers. Since I started taking more checks where I work, 
I have since noticed a lot of things that are kinda messed up. 1) Check 
writers always borrow your pen. 2) They then have to record the check 
wasting time. 3) They seem offended when you ask for a drivers licence.
4) If they have it with them. 5) Some people have temporary checks with 
nothing preprinted, and they expect vendors to take them.
        Think about how easy it is to commit check fraud if a vendor will 
take a non-preprinted check. Just go get some temp checks from yer bank, 
write some bullshit info up top, 'forget' your licence, and you are set. 
Vendor loses out on a lot of money.
        Now you have this piece of paper that represents money, and it 
sits at the retail store. The next day it gets deposited, by the end of 
that day the transaction is completed by the bank, and money is credited 
to the vendor. Just about two days pass before the bank even messes with 
the check. That also gives the check writer just over a day to cancel 
payment on the check if they want, and let the vendor worry about 
collecting on the money. Some real small businesses can't afford to have 
the backing of Telecredit and really can't afford the time/effort/manpower 
to go track down someone so they can collect.
        Checks are so far obselete but people use them way too much. The 
only practical purpose of them is for sending payment through the mail.

        Charge. If you have a charge card, you have to sign something 
when you use it but no card carriers have pens with them. Ever notice 
how some business losers will charge everything from a 3000 dollar 
computer system to a 1 dollar pack of gum on a card. They are like 
chain chargers or something. Since credit cards are used so much, and 
the link ups are so well established, why aren't we fully on a debit 
system? You have a card that represents your bank account. On the front
is a picture of you to avoid some credit abuse etc.
        Speaking of credit abuse, it is so simple for some teenager to 
get ahold of another person's credit card and go abuse the hell out of 
it. Hell, charge up a ton of stuff, ship it off to Mozambique by FedEx 
and just have a general hayday on someone else's card. Cruel, yes, 
funny, yes. Any smart chimp could get out of the payment on such a 
charge but once again, it is more a pain in the ass. Phone order 
credit fraud is prevailent with mail order companies. One more reason 
to go to direct debit in person. Even though it is convenient to mail 
order something, when you think about it, how much effort does it take 
to run to the local computer store to get it there?
        Step up and use your card to directly pay for merchandise.
Sounds good and it is a very realistic system, but for some reason these 
high dollar companies won't get their head out of their ass. 

        So that leaves us with cash, like you are going to carry much 
around these days, checks, which are getting to be a pain in the ass 
because it takes so long to write, record, verify info, etc, and last 
you have credit, but one step short of a good system. Money is evil no 
doubt. You may have read a few files out there about the problems with 
it and the inherent evil it causes in homo sapiens. But now it has 
become a pain in the ass it seems.

        So bitch at your bank to go a debit system or something.
We have the technology, it would make life a tad bit easier,
but like humans, we are just falling behind in mental capacity
like usual.
