                          UFO - The Secret
                          ----------------
 
    Your walking along the nile river. Its 3000 B.C. You look up into 
the sky. Ra, the sun god have arived again. He is here to make another 
visit to Ged, the living God. You watch as the bright disc lands on the 
ground. You know someone, or something comes out of the disc. But the 
only one who is allowed to see that is the Pharaoh himself. You make the 
final touches on the brick you are making for the new temple being 
built. You draw the disc you just saw in the sky. It is circular, and
gold. You inscribe a golden disc on the chest of Osiris, to show him as 
a god. You are having an average day. The next will probably be just 
the same. 
 
    Your sitting on your porch. The year is 1694. You notice a bright 
light in the sky. You realize, the angels are coming for you. They land 
in their discus chariot. They come out. They look nothing like angels, 
but like dwarf, elves, or leprachans or something. You get scared, what 
are they doing. They take you aboard their ship with unknown powers. As 
soon as they return you you spread rumors that angels of God abducted 
you and tortured you. You are declared a witch/wizard and burned at the
stake. 
 
    Your sitting on your car with a couple of friends. The year is 1956
You start talking about school and other things. Then out of nowhere a 
bright flash goes across the sky. You say to each other that it was cool,
wondering if it was a comet or something. All of you knew it was too
low to be a comet. Then out of nowhere 5 Air Force Helicopters fly
from behind you chasing after the object. You turn on the radio and
listen to reports of UFO sightings, and Air Force Helicopters chasing
it. You can only sit there and wonder of the posibilities. 
 
    Your sitting in a crop field in England. The year is 1994. You are 
with a group of researchers. You all form a circle and meditate with a 
vision of a triangle in your head. After 3 hours of sitting there and 
concentrating you all get up and go into the house near by. When you 
wake up in the morning you all go to the spot where you had been 
medatating at. You notice a triangle has been formed. How did it get 
there, who made it? You all have a pretty good idea.
 
    Your a Green baret officer for the United States government. The 
year is 1988. You have just been assigned to guard a building in the
middle of Arizona. Once you get there you are told the following "If
ANYTHING comes out of that building shoot to kill, ANYTHING. Do not let
anyone in this building unless we tell you to. They have to get a special
permit to come in here, as soon as they get that then they will tell us,
we will then check it out to make sure it's all confirmed. Then we will
tell you to let them in as soon as they arrive... Understood?" "Yes Sir!"
"Alright then, you may leave, oh and one last thing Mr... You are not
to discus anything that happens to you from right now until your
are dismissed from here. If you do, we will find you, and Kill you.
understood?" "Yes, Sir!". You are very nervous, what could be so secret
that you couldn't even tell your own mother about?. All you do is
stand there and guard the building. You aren't even allowed in it.
This is a very large building, you could probably turn it into an
airport if needed. Hmm thats probably what it's for, a secret military
air force base. Well.. maybe you will never know. So you do as told.
    A couple weeks after you are assigned you see some smoke in the
distance, You are then told to ignore what you are about to see, and
let it by. What ever it is, it's round, and very big. It has to be
carried by three train trailers, and is covered up by a big brown
sheet, probably to cameflauge (~) it with the desert sand. Oh well, you
let it by and ignore it as told. You are the perfect military soldier.
    About one month later a man comes up to the base, you have gotten
no order to let him in, so you ask for orders. As the officers inside
the base run it through the computers the man begins to tell you many
things. He says "Do you know what you are guarding?" "I am not ordered
to speak to you." "Humph. You probably don't know anyway. Let me explain.
This is a base where the government puts UFOs and aliens". You begin
to get curious, he continues "you see, they put them here, in the
desert so no one will find them. I mean, people explore through the
mountains all the time, so it wouldn't be smart to put them there. And
how many people do you think wander the desert looking for things? They
are all afraid they would die and would find nothing.. so they don't".
Now you become extremely interested. "UFO and aliens have been around
since before man was. Where they came from, I dunno. But they are here".
The door opens and 5 officers come out. One is the commander that
introduced you here, this is the first time you have seen him since
then, he says "Hi again, you have been doing a good job, I hope you
weren't listening to the lies the man has been telling you.." "No sir"
the other 4 officers take the man, two grab in and slam him against
the wall, the other two point their guns at him. "Thats good. Your
going to be promoted soon if you keep it up. <cough>" to the other
officers he says "Gentlemen". The two officers open fire killing the
man, the other two walk off with his dead body. "You handled this
situation correctly, lets hope there are no more like it. He was a spy
from Russia. I know, even know there is a peace between us, there are
still tensions." "Yes sir!". He walks back into the building and the
officers with the guns follow.. you hear some screaming from the inside
of the building, unhumanly screams. You get a chill up your spine and
try not to think about what just happened.
    Time goes by, a couple more of those round things were delivered,
no more spy's. You are happy. Then one day the Commander comes out and
starts to speak "Mr. It was nice having you here, you were an ideal
officer. I hope our next one will be just as good. But I am afraid to
tell you that you are requested back in phoenix. You will leave
immediately. These two officers will drive you there. Have a good life
Mr." "Yes Sir". You get into the jeep with the other two officers you
have never seen before. They blind fold you and then drive you to
Phoenix, as commanded. One of them asks you if you saw anything strange
while there, you said no. You can hear the car stop, you ask if you are
to Phoenix yet, they say no, and they would tell you when you are there.
You hear a truck or something pass, then you continue on your way. You
are now in Phoenix, you get out get reassigned, and after two years you get
to go home.
    Five years after you left the army you see a show on aliens, it
reminds you of that one man who came to the base, the one they shot.
You begin to get interested and then one day you find yourself talking
about what happened to another person. The next day you get a knock on
your door, as you wonder who it could be as you open it up. There are to
men, they look like orientals with bigger heads, eyes, and their faces
are really pale. You notice the car in front of your house, And the
clothes you are wearing. It's all black. They must really like black huh.
So one of them begins to talk "You have a son in Denver Colorado,
correct?" "Yes, thats correct, how do you know that, who are you guys"
"That is not important, but what I am about to say is. You were to tell
NO ONE about where you where while in Arizona. Let me warn you now, if you
tell another sole as long as you live not only will we kill you, but
we will kill your son too". You are so scared you can hardly mutter a "I
understand" and they leave. As you stand there you wonder.. Where did they
come from? How did they know I talked? Was that man right so long ago?
Could I have done something then? Can I still do something now? Why is
the government hiding this? What are they scared of? And you try to come
up with answers the best way you can.. All you can come up with is that
our government is hiding something from us, something big, something they
don't want anyone to know about. And all you can ever wonder is... Why?
 
Rage-303

        I am not trying to tell you that there are Flying Saucers and
aliens coming down to earth everyday.  I just want you to know that there
have been Flying Saucer reports since before civilization started. Cave men 
used to draw pictures of them on the cave walls. Open your mind. We all 
know that the government cannot just up and say "Yes there are aliens.. 
here is one", that would be desaster upon the earth. It would change the 
way we think, the way we act, our religion, etc.. there would be no end. 
But.. we all know whats really going on.
