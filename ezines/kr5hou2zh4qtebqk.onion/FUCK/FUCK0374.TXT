			   Them and Us
                           -----------

	So I was eavesdropping on yet another conversation at 
lunch the other day and I overheard some overly made-up, motherly 
looking woman talking to some of the other employees who were 
outside smoking cigarettes. In a holier-than-thou voice, 
announced, "You know, they say that every cigarette you smoke 
takes seven minutes off of your life."
	Of course the smokers looked at her stupidly and dismissed
her entirely, but that statement actually got me thinking. It 
made me wonder who "They" are and what gave Them so much clout.
How many people have you heard say, "They say that it's bad for 
you to go swimming within a half an hour after eating." And how 
many people adhere to that religiously? Personally, I have never 
seen any medical reports with empirical evidence stating that the
effects of water on undigested food are detrimental to ones' 
health. 
	And how about this one: "They say that if you drink beer 
before you drink hard alcohol, it will make you sick." Now, there 
is actually some evidence that this is true, (nothing documented 
that I am aware of, though) but it really gives me the creeps that 
the general public, as a whole puts so much faith in what They say. 
Even though most of Their claims are considerably trivial, it  
causes one to notice how blindly people trust these unnamed pundits.
These pseudo-experts of virtually everything.
	I mean, hearing a "They say" warning can definitely warrant
a certain amount of caution, but what kind of pathetic, weak minded
lemmings are we to go jumping off a cliff just because They say 
that there is something even more dangerous behind us.
	Even more terrifying are the alleged "facts" that everyone
seems to know all about. I can't even count how many times someone
told me something they claimed was a fact that I either knew was
bullshit or I later found out was untrue. And if you don't believe
that people are so easily led by lies, try this little experiment
sometime. Tell someone something silly, like "You know, cabbage has
five times the vitamin C of an orange." Now, make sure you follow
this little tidbit up with "It's a well known fact." Most people
will either agree with you like they already knew that or they will 
just look at you stupidly, too afraid to ask questions about 
something that they are apparently supposed to know about, but
don't. They won't rebut your claim of facthood and they won't even
bother to check it out for themselves. If you find yourself someone
who actually challenges the lie; Congratulations. You found some
intelligent life. This person is your friend.
	It's funny how you can join Their ranks just as long as you 
know how to bullshit. Yes, you too can be an expert on any subject. 
Just TELL people you have expertise and you're in. Pretty sad.
