                          CHECKS CASHED HERE
                          ------------------

Have you noticed more check cashing stores popping up in your home town?  
It must be a pretty good business these days.  I believe it has 
something to do with more people living paycheck to paycheck many of 
whom probably don't even have bank accounts.  Pretty sad thought.  Could 
you imagine having a job but not having a bank account?  How do these 
people pay bills or save money for that matter?

How come the rich keep getting richer and the poor stay poor?  Well if 
you had several thousands or millions of dollars lying about what would 
you do with it?  Sure, you would INVEST it in real estate, bonds, and 
most of all stocks.  Earn about 10% a year on your money and it will 
double in about seven years.  Hell, given enough time even your money in 
a savings account (2-3% interest) will double but you'll never get 
"rich" off the interest by keeping your money in the bank.  The old 
saying "It takes money to make money" is very true and if you want to 
have more money you have to do what those with lots of money do-invest.

There are too many so-called "spend thrifts" today earning a decent 
living and spending everything, or worst yet, more than they make.  
Could you imagine making thirty plus grand a year and having nothing to 
show for it in the bank?  I know people like this and the more people I 
talk to the more I find caught in this rut.  Either this or they have 
money in the bank earning 3-5% in a savings or CD account.  The bottom 
line is they are not investing this money and the money they do make is 
practically nothing after inflation and taxes are figured in.  Ever hear 
people whine about the declining middle class, the rich getting richer, 
and more people becoming poor?  Perhaps it makes a little more sense 
now.

Credit cards make things so easy these days.  "Twelve months, no 
payment, no interest.  Now is a good time to buy that BIG screen TV."  
After your twelve months are up you better have the TV paid off or your 
ass is likely to be paying interest for the past 12 months.  Some people 
can't see the gimmick and others choose to ignore the small print but 
it's there and you better believe the "rich" guy will know what the deal 
is before buying the TV.  It is kind of like that "survival of the 
fittest" theory.  Of course the rich are going to get richer-they are 
smart with their money, sometimes frugal (sad thought often true).  I'm 
sure you've heard the story about the neighborhood boy selling products 
for a school trip and the guy at the house with the broken down Chevy 
buys something but the guy with the Lexus doesn't.  It has happened, it 
is happening, and it will continue to happen.  Course we shouldn't group 
all rich people into money hungry republicans who don't care because 
there are many nice and generous rich folks.

I think we all can agree on the fact that we would all like to have a 
little more money, or maybe even a lot more.  It won't be easy traveling 
the road to wealth but if you start to invest like the rich people are 
doing you will be on your way having more money.  Question is are you 
willing to sacrifice a little today to have more tomorrow?  Or are you 
living for today only?

In order to invest you will require money.  Now, if you have a job or 
some sort of incoming you are on the right track.  The most important 
thing is to avoid debt and get out of debt.  To avoid debt one must  
resist the urge to impulse buy what you do not need-especially big 
ticket items like stereos, TV's, cars, computers.  Instead, think about 
what you want, why you want it, and then, perhaps, shop around for a 
good deal (i.e. research).  Now maybe what I said about the rich above 
makes a little more sense.

Another important tip is to avoid spending what you do not have.  If you 
want to buy a $500 color TV on a credit card and don't have $500 in your 
savings/checking account then wait until you do.  Hell, you may even 
have the $500 cause you cashed your paycheck but will you have the money 
at the end of the month after you paid the rent and the credit bill 
arrives?  THINK!  Because if you don't think smart you will never become 
smart.

The final and all important tip is when you get your paycheck set aside 
some for investing.  Save five, ten or whatever percentage you can 
afford without going into debt.  Take that money and INVEST it-don't put 
it in a savings or CD account that won't earn you any money; do what the 
rich people are doing.  Nike, Ford, Coca-Cola, Mobil, Motorola, AT&T, 
and Budweiser are all familiar brand names.  They are also companies you 
can invest in by buying their stock.  You can invest in companies 
individually through stocks or in a variety of companies through mutual 
funds.  Hey, if you feel AMD will have the next greatest product you can 
invest in them.  Buying stocks helps you by increasing in value and 
helps the company whose stock you buy continue to operate.  In fact I 
work for a company whose sole income comes from investors.  Without the 
investors money I wouldn't have a paycheck.  And believe it or not their 
are a lot of companies like this--many of which are in the biotechnology 
field.  And invest for the long term, not for a couple months.  Think 
about it, but only if you want to have more money.

Check out www.netstockdirect.com to find out how you can invest directly 
into some companies for minimal fees.  E-Trade offers cheap online 
trading (www.etrade.com) for $15 to $20 per transaction.  Even if you 
can only buy a few shares it will be worth the time, effort, and 
investment.  A single share of McDonalds stock in the early sixties 
($22.50) is worth over $13,000 today.  Hey, it is not magic but rather 
the power of time and compounding interest.  Read "Learn to Earn" for 
even a better insight into investing and why you should invest.

I'm not rich nor do I believe becoming rich will make me a better 
person.  I do have money invested in the stock market (more than I have 
in the bank) and will continue to invest so long as I have extra money.  
The stock market can be risky but over the long term it has a proven 
track record of making people and companies lots of money.  Don't just 
take my word for it, look at the facts.

On a closing note it is good to live for today but it is also important 
to plan for tomorrow.  For some investing requires sacrifices but the 
rewards (in time) will be great.

Think about it,

Pallbearer
