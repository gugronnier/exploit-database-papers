                               Looking Back VII
                               ----------------

126 - "I Am The Only Way To Go!" by Rage - About how close minded people who
      believe strongly in something can be extremly dangerous.

151 - "Memorial" by Legion - How does death affect you? How should it?

152 - "Capitalistic Slavery" by Dem - A good look at how the government
      is screwing us, even as you advance to better positions in life.

153 - "Respectfully Yours" by Dem - Hating the general public.. and why.

154 - "You Can't Survive Without Being a Rebel" by Voy - In every day
      life, you have to rebel against the standard in order to make it.

155 - "Three Cheers for O.J. Simpson!" by Deadkat - Is O.J. the biggest
      hacker in today's society? Maybe he is!

156 - "The Giving Spirit" by Dis - A good look at how even today's churches
      lie about them giving goodness to the world. If they are so greedy
      on something so small.. think bigger.

157 - "A Higher Purpose" by Disorder - Another story to show what we can
      do when we put our minds to it. Nothing is hidden.

      buy into it.

162 - "The Man Keeps ME Down" by Dis - America Online's advertising
      is completely ridiculous. No pampered black hollywood actor
      should dictate to me about the man keeping him down.

163 - "Pseudo-Article" by K2 - A vitriolic masterpiece on the now trendy view 
      of anarchy by school kids.

164 - "You Don't Know Me" by Anon - Just because you don't recognize
      my nick doesn't mean I know nothing.

165 - "A Voyager's Parable" by Voyager - "It's an almost certain cure
      for a good mood"

166 - "Jehova, Lord of the Universe" by Rage -  An alternative
      science-fiction view of the creation of Christianity.

167 - "The 1996 Election" by Major - Ever caught yourself voting
      and having no choice in the candidates?

168 - "Jonathan Smith: President" by Dem - A file about what society
      would be like if your position in life was determined by IQ.

169 - "Freedom of the Press..." by Major - It is more than a right..
      it is something we have to use.

170 - "What Am I Doing?" by Deadkat - Just playing with my computer,
      or am i?

171 - "Major51" by  Major - Information about the recent Celco51 sting
      operation, and how it wasn't quite what the news portrayed.

172 - "Pathways to Eleetness" by Voyager - "Do you find yourself being
      shunned by those more elite than you?"

174 - "The Superior Race" by K2 - An anti-white viewpoint on humankind's 
problems.
