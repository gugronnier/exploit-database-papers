                                Recent News
                                -----------

        Things are still going as you noticed. Files are picking up again
and I have actually had time to write myself. It is quite frustrating to
have 25 or more file ideas, all sitting ready to be written yet have no
time to do it. Since I started a new position at work, I have had time to
do more (at work even), and have been kicking out more files.
        Submit! If you would like to submit a file for release with the
group, please do. I am always looking for contributions. Mail them to
me and I will be in touch regarding the release. On the net, mail to:

                        jericho@netcom.com

        If you aren't on the net, you can do a few other things. Mail me
on any of the 303 boards that I list in the distro sites. If you still
can't find a way to do any of that, find someone with a net account and
mail me via a friend.
        Distro sites. As said long ago, I am only doing three distro sites
per area code. Mail me with a completed application (FUCK-APP.TXT), and
I will put you in the lineup. If you are one of the first three boards
in your AC, you automatically become a distro site. If not, then you are
put on the list and become one if one of the other boards goes down for
some reason. *** The ONLY advantage of being a distro site is I put your
BBS name and number in these files. If you are the first for your AC, then
you are advertised at the end of each file. If you are the second or third,
then you are put in the master list every 25th file, or when I release
a 'current news' file. If you wish to carry the files, PLEASE DO. You can 
call yourself a distro if want, that is fine with me. I only want these 
files to be circulated.
        If you are on the net and want the newest releases, mail me at
the above address saying you wish to get new releases. I have a 'mailing
list' set up so I can mail it to anyone who wants it. If you mail me back,
it does not get circulated to everyone, only I see it.
        Also, if you are interested in getting other interesting news,
funny stories, convention info, or whatever else I get, I have a 'forward
mailing list' set up. Mail me if you would like to be on this. Recently,
I have been bouncing a lot of information on current legislation affecting
online access, articles about the Waco hearings, and other stuff.

        As usual, any comments, questions, bitches, gripes, submissions,
flames, threats, or anything else, mail me :  jericho@netcom.com
