                              Conformity
                              ----------

        What is wrong with being different today?  Well, I can't answer that,
and I don't think that many people can.  I can tell you that society does not
like the free thinker or the individual spirit to be roaming around the cities
and towns herbouts.  Let me give you some examples of where lots of people 
lose their will to be different and the need to be a cog that meshes with 
the world around them.
        School beats down individuality by making all the students follow the 
same conduct.  It doesn't matter what a child would like to do in school, it 
is what they have to do just to pass.  "Color the sky blue, no matter what it 
looks like to you.  I don't care if you are smart enough to work the math out 
in your head, put it down on paper like everyone else has to do".  I can see
rules to keep order, but the educational system we live in has so many rules 
that free thought is crushed, and anyone with the intelligence to do math in
their head has to do it on the paper anyway.  School dress codes push more
conformity down our collective throats by making students wear clothes chosen
not by them, but by people with ideas that are completely different than those
possesed by students.  Schools with uniforms brag about how they limit fights,
and how it makes students more equal.  They fail to see that it doesn't let
little kids choose what they would like to wear to school.  Uniforms may make
the students look equal, and think the same, but they don't let the students
make a statement about who they are in what they wear.  Heh.
        TV.  Another of those mind crushers.  All the shows most widely seen
by the youth of our country don't encourage people to think for themselves.
90210?  Hah, when has one of those weenies ever done something that was 
original or the work of an indivdual.  All of the students dress, think, and 
act alike, like some huge colony of rich lemmings (without the mass suicide).
Think about it, that is one of the shows that teenagers watch every week, and 
now it is in syndication!  What TV tells us is that if you just blend in with
the masses and go along with the crowd, you will be much happier.  TV also
makes it look like if you think for yourself, or if you don't go with the flow,
you are just an extra or material for a sitcom.  Everyone is happier when they
conform in the wide world of television.
        Finally we have just society in general.  In addition to beating down
the populace with TV and the school system, society also tells you that you 
have to live like this, eat this, look like this, etc to be successful and 
happy, and since most of this comes to us from the television we believe it
without questioning the statement or its worth.  
        That's it from me here.  If you want to be another fucking mindless
automaton, feel free.  Remember those faceless pink drones in Pink Floys's 
"The Wall"?  Just think of those as you topple head first into the meat 
grinder everyone calls society.

 Brutality, The Elite, all of which are American dreams.  All of which are
 American dreams....

        fastjack would like to thank Rage Against the Machine for lots of 
ideas, and Mephisto Groove for having a slower modem than I do.
