                            Idiot National Park
                            -------------------

Wraveth forwarded this to me on the net. Who knows where it started,
but this is yet another example of how pitiful people can be.

Here are a collection of actual questions which park rangers have
received at the indicated parks.  They're every bit as breath-taking
as the landscapes which inspired them.

Everglades National Park
------------------------
Are the alligators real?
Are the baby alligators for sale?
Where are the rides?
What time does the two o'clock bus leave?

Grand Canyon National Park
--------------------------
Was this man-made?
Do you light it up at night?
I bought tickets for the elevator to the bottom - where is it?
Is the mule train air-conditioned?
So where are the faces of the presidents?

Denali National Park
--------------------
What time to you feed the bears?
What's so wonderful about Wonder Lake?
Can you show me where the Yeti lives?
How often do you mow the tundra?
How much does Mt. McKinley weigh?

Mesa Verde National Park
------------------------
Did people build this, or did Indians?
Why did they build the ruins so close to the road?
Do you know of any undiscovered ruins?
What did they worship in the kivas - their own made-up religion?
Why did the Indians decide to live in Colorado?

Yellowstone National Park
-------------------------
Does Old Faithful erupt at night?
How do you turn it on?
When does the guy who turns it on get to sleep?
We had no trouble finding the park entrances, but where are the exits?

Carlsbad Caverns National Park
------------------------------
How much of the cave is underground?
So what's in the unexplored part of the cave?
Does it ever rain in here?
How many Ping-Pong balls would it take to fill this up?
So what it this - just a hole in the ground?

Yosemite National Park
----------------------
Where are the cages for the animals?
What time of year do you turn on Yosemite Falls?
What happened to the other half of Half Dome?
Can I get a picture taken with the carving of President Clinton?
