                        musical reflections
                        -------------------

        Having read most of the F.U.C.K. files to date, I notice a common
theme, women.  I'd like to say that the inspiration for this file is original
but being the male I am, this is all about a female, just like the rest.
The only difference is that I'm not going to write one damned original thing,
this is just a big file of song lyrics that reflect how I feel, or just hit
home sometime.


"Someday, maybe she'll come back to me, and I'll say 'Why don't you go
fuck yourself, everybodys talking, knows that I'm lying, she gave me
everything, all I want is more, she won't do anything and I'll always
wait for her."                  -Reel Big Fish "All I want is more"

"I don't fucking care, I don't fucking care, and I don't fucking care anymore
it's gonna be alright, and i don't fucking care anymore."
                                -Reel Big Fish "Nothing"

"I've had enough sad memories to last me all my life, I learned to live with
doubt and I learned to live without, but not this time, I was walking wounded
I said never again, she makes it easy, she's my best friend."
                                -All "Right"

"Nothing means nothing to no one I know, unless it's a lie, a lie is the only
thing I see when i look in their eyes, I know there's no good, everything's
bad, and it hurts to be apart, Black sky, black sky, what's wrong with me?"
                                -All "Black Sky"

"I hate everyone but you, sometimes I even hate you too"
                                -Therapy "Totally Random Man"

"Making believe that you still love me, it's leaving me alone and so blue,
I'll always dream, but I'll never own you, Making believe is all I can do.
I can't hold you close darling when you're not with me, you're somebodys
love, you'll never be mine, Making believe I'll spend my lifetime loving you
and making believe"
                                -Social Distortion "Making Believe"

"Well I passed the bar on the way to my dingy hotel room, I spent all my
money, been drinkin since half past noon, I'll wake there in the morning, or
maybe in the county jail, times are hard, getting harder, I'm born to lose
destined to fail"
                                -Social Distortion "Ball and Chain"

"Sometimes I laugh and sometimes I cry, other times I sit and wonder why
Sometimes I'm up and sometimes I'm down, other times I wanna blow this town"
                                -Social Distortion "Sometimes I Do"

"I lost a girl, it's just as well, she tried to save me from myself, I still
got her on my mind, tossing and turning in my bed, but if she had stayed
another week, I would have dragged her down with me, she took it til she had
enough, is that what I thought love was? I told her see you later, but it's
hard to see at all at the bottom of a barrell with your back against the wall"
                                -Descendants "Coolidge"

"When I get the time, I'd like to sit down and write a little rhyme for you,
just a couple few, I'd tell you what you mean to me, When I get the time, I'll
put it all down and pick you up, I'd say throw it all away, the world is me
and you tonight, Will there come a day with nothing standing in my way,
living that dream within your arms, I'll make it happen someday when I get
the time. I look in your eyes, warm places inside I've never been before,
I gotta find some more, I know you don't owe me anything, when I get the time
when I get the guts to live my life for me, and I do what I wanna do, I'll
be the friend that you said you once knew, will there come a day, when we
give up and turn away, and I have nothing left, nothing left, But I have
all the time in the world, time to remember, look through the window and cry"
                                -Descendants "Get The Time"

"Should have been the driver, could have been the one, I shoulda been your
lover, but I hadn't seen.."
                                -Wilco "Passenger side"


And one I know we all feel from time to time

"Let's bail, I don't wanna be here, let's bail, I wanna leave here.
Let's bail, agitate the gravel, let's bail, saddle up and travel"
                                -All "Let's bail"


And there you have it, a whole collection of song lyrics that reflect my
feelings as of late, not as good as just writing about them, but definitely
and interesting way to show how I feel.

Shout outs to all of 303, Disorder for riding my jock til I wrote this,
Pill and Rage for being Booze Brothers above and beyond the call of duty
and all the artists who keep writing good music.
