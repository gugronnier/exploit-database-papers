                              The Urine Pit
                              -------------

The Urine Pit mere feet from the commerce and recreation taking place on
the 16th Street Mall, it is a dark and foreboding place.  During the
daylight hours, it is populated primarily by skatepunks, who show how
different they are by trying to look and act as much like each other as
possible.  At dusk, a transformation begins, and by nightfall, The Urine
Pit becomes home to various forms of dregs.  Mostly young, all abusing the
drug (or drugs) of their choice, and all completely hopeless and burnt
out.  It is not a hangout, or meeting place, so much as it is an actual
home.  The Urine Pit reeks of urine, thus the name.  It's nocturnal
residents (dubbed the UrineKids) have chosen to live among their own
waste.  The Urine Pit is the length of a city block, alongside a highrise
building.  It is sunken, below street-level, and lined with trees,
fountains, and benches.  During the day, it is a nice place to look at. 
At night, the trees become shelter, and the benches become beds.  The
UrineKids tend to break off into small groups (perhaps the group they
associate with defines the drug that they are currently using?), but they
all seem to know each other.  In an area that is only a block long, they
have created entire "neighborhoods", each with its own distinct (albeit
quite similar) personality.  Wandering into the wrong "neighborhood" will
likely result in a verbal confrontation, and (if the participants are able
to muster enough coordination) quite possibly a physical fight.  Strangers
are not welcome in the Urine Pit, and the UrineKids make it known to
outsiders that their presence it not desired.  Most trespassers in the
Urine Pit are people leaving the Mall area, and the taunts of the
UrineKids are enough to persuade them to find another route to their
destination.  But their taunts are not really serious.  They are just a
result of the UrineKids not being able to communicate in a manner more
understandable to most humans that inhabit this planet.  And their threats
are empty, as well.  UrineKids have a nearly universal reaction to
strangers that actually try to talk to them.  First, confusion and
suspicion.  They wonder why would somebody actually want to talk to them
(a valid question, I admit).  This stage passes rather quickly,
surprisingly quickly in fact.  The stranger is then regaled with the life
story of that particular UrineKid, and the stories are nearly universal as
well.  Physical abuse, various addictions, and general mistreatment by
society as a whole.  The UrineKids have escaped from bad environments,
ostensibly created by others, and managed to create a new environment for
themselves that is even worse than the one they left behind.  And they
will not escape from this one, for this is where they have put themselves. 
This is where they want to be.  I don't know how the UrineKids feed
themselves, or how they clothe themselves, or how they buy their drugs. 
But they do, and they will do nothing else until their last breath passes
from their lungs.  UrineKids can't die, because they aren't really alive. 
They merely exist, and when one goes, another will be there to take his or
her place.  Nobody will notice this occurrence, because they are generic,
they are very much the same.  Perhaps there is a glimmer of hope in the
fact that the UrineKids are so willing, in fact eager, to tell their
stories, to be heard.  Perhaps they are looking for someone who will
understand, and will be able to help them.  Or, they may be looking for
empty pity, for they surely pity themselves.  But none of the UrineKids
asked for anything, not even spare change.  In fact, they were quite
generous with their own cigarettes, glad to share a smoke with somebody
who would listen to them for five minutes.  One of them mentioned respect. 
He didn't know why we were talking to him, but he thought it showed that
we respected him, and he respected us for that.  No.  His drugged-out mind
would not have been able to realize that unless you respect yourself, it
is simply not possible for others to respect you.  But it interesting that
it was so important to him that he be given some respect.  Somewhere
within himself, he actually believed that he posses some quality that
merits respect.  Perhaps, somewhere within himself, he actually does
possess some worthy quality, but that quality will never see the light of
day.  It is unfortunate that the UrineKids were somehow created, at least
in part, by other people, yet it remains up to them to find a way out of
the Pit.  But they simply don't know how, nor is it likely that they will
ever learn how, for they do not care.  The only way to eradicate the
UrineKids is to stop making new ones.  Judging from the number residents
at the Urine Pit, there is no shortage of UrineKids, so it should not be
difficult to find a UrineKid in the making in your very own neighborhood. 
Step in, and see if you can't find a way to stop them from growing into a
full-fledged UrineKid.  You should get a certain amount of satisfaction
from helping save a life.  If not that, at least you can take pride in
knowing you kept the stench in the Pit from getting worse.
