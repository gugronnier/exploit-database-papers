                        Good God I Love to Get Stoned
                        -----------------------------

I've smoked five joints already today. 

Sometimes, when I'm twisted, I feel a freedom I don't otherwise have. I like
to hack and phreak while my spine is hunched over a fat nugget. FUCK, they
*still* haven't put my phone line in yet. I just fucking moved and it's going
to take them like 11 days to get somebody out here. How am I supposed to 
check my godforsaken email? ...

I should just whip out my datastar and take care of this mess. Instead I have
to drag my laptop into another room in this building just to get online. 

I've found out some cool things since I've moved. I've had a chance to work
with my new Tandy PRO-2035 radio scanner. Two of the portable phones in this 
building (at least) transmit on 46.630, and my neighbors are on 46.670. 

Elton and Billy next door and some girl across the street have no idea how 
much their privacy is being compromised. I should probably be ashamed or 
whatever, but I'm not. I am feeling no tinge of a conscious as I listen to 
every phone call they make or receive. I just want to yell out the window, 
"Hit the goddamned "CHANNEL" button so I at least have to scan for a few 
more seconds before I eavesdrop on your intensely private (heh) conversation
any longer!" 

I wonder what you thought about as you read the first line of this text file. 
There's no telling. Were you put off (likely) or was it more of a dread
feeling (more likely)? Maybe you're stoned right now too. Who the fuck knows?

I hate to think about what others think about because I have no idea. 
And if they can lie with any kind of skill, I never will. 

That's why I've taken to 'people hacking'. There's a FUCK file about people
hacking your way into a job, but I like to take it a step further, but with
a much simpler method. The method is easy: every night think about the day 
that just passed and what happened to you throughout the day. Think about 
what people said, what you witnessed, and what you eavesdropped. Think about
how what you know can be used (manipulated) for your own benefit. 

Fuck loyalty. Fuck friendship - they are temporary. Fight for yourself and
your own happiness, because you don't know it, but everyone else is. If you
do it consciously and they do it subconsciously, that means you have an 
advantage when somebody's ass is Up Against The Wall. In the end, you only
have yourself. 

Computers never fuck with you and ruin your life like people do. That's why
only my computer knows my secrets. I'm not saying the NSA couldn't read my
e-diary, but you can't. Fuck the NSA too. 

Back to smoking - I enjoy it - it's no big thing, I guess, it's just another
illegal hobby. I wish they'd just fucking bend and legalize the shit. Kinda
reminds me of this big-toofed manager from the UK and what he said about
cigarettes: "Either fucking outlaw it or stop making me feel like a leper."
He was a socialist, though, and not all there. I'd like to change that 
to something more agreeable, how about: "Stop making me feel like a leper."
Fuck your stupid law that is absolutely NOT applicable to me. gees.  ... 

I used to call this BBS everyday and contribute to it, posting, uploading, 
shit like that. And I know what's good for a BBS because I used to sysop. 
Nothing ever improved on that board - the sysop was a dumbass. So I stopped 
calling, right? Of course. 

Too bad we can't stop calling this universe. The fucking sysop is an asshole. 


thanks for reading

ps - fuck you for stigmatizing opinion and forcing me to express myself
anonymously.
