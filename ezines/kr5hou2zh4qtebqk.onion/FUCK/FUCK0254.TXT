                                VS
                                --

My roomate and I just finished arguing tonight (again) about whether or
not my Sega Saturn kicks his Sony Playstation's ass.  (it does).  We tend
to have these arguements late at night when we are doing the paperwork
after our shift at our local stuffer-shack, which we happen to manage.

After I got home, made the rounds of local BBSes (too broke to call LD
anymore, still haven't gotten an ISP, female in my life sucks right now...)
I sat and pondered what drove myself, my friend, and people everywhere
to argue some of the most inane things to the ground.

I mean, it's not confined to such things as video-game systems.  Every
couple of months, someone has to re-vitalize the arguement that has existed
for more than a decade: Macintosh vs. IBM (and clones, etc etc), sometimes
tossing in UNIX nowadays for good measure.  Now that homosexuality isn't
faux pax as to the degree it was, I've even heard TEENAGERS arguing
which 'way' was better.  Gay vs Straight.

Females against males.  Which sex is the dominant one (one look at
history should make that clear, but chicks just don't get it.  Heh.)
Sports nuts (the bane of human mental evolution) don't just argue team vs
team anymore, some go as far as to declare their favorite sport as
being 'better' than others!  "Yeah, well soccer is much harder to play than
baseball", I overheard (read?) one lamer espouse upon the other.  What?
Not to mention religion.  Hell, we've had the crusades, the inquisition,
each one with some nutcase (sent from god, or something) declaring
his/her religion to be the true one, and slaying any populace who disagrees.
Racism.  Black vs White.  White vs Red.  White vs (wait, I sense a
pattern here...) etc...

The list goes on and on.  It may have no ending, as each generation has a
new set of conflicts, and re-hashes age-old ones to boot.

What fuels this undying need for conflict?  Heh, I have a theory.

              -=No one wants to side with the loser.=-

Thats it.  Pretty neat theory huh?  It took me all of five seconds to
formulate, and I'm sure (100%) its been thought hundreds of time
before.

But it answers that question completely.  Which question?  Pick one.
God vs No-God.  White vs Black.  Saturn vs Playstation.  No one wants
to be on the losing side. We build up our 'side' inside our psyche, we
research our 'slant' and make sure we can demolish the opposition when
we argue.  We root for our 'team' in hopes we can drive them to succede
like we declared.  We hope that we weren't slighted by fate and born the
wrong color.  We pray to any deity listening that GOOD games come out on
our console so we can wave them in our friends faces and say, "See!!@#
I got the good stuff, you have shit!@".

We secretly cherish in our hearts, the knowledge that our opposition will
be merrily burning in hell when judgement comes about.  We laugh before
we go to sleep each night knowing that christians the world over are
wasting thier life trying to conform to a myth.

When do we as humans assume these 'sides'?  Well, sure, we're usually
born with some of our 'sides' choosen for us by genes.  Yeah, some of the
sides we assume when we make our purchases down at Best Buy.  But where does
the need to fight for some of our choices arise?  Why do we feel the
need to put down our 'opposition', often times when nothing arises to incite
such hostility? 

Why do we as humans have this incessant urge to fight one another?  Is it
entirely a bad thing?  Which came first...the arguement, or the
arguementative?  I still can't figure out where we get our drive to name
one thing tantamount to another.  I mean, sure, there are some valid
arguements for many of those cases, but not always.  And sometimes its a
matter of perspective.

But still we fight to no end (often times WAY out of proportion) to
make sure the world understands _we are right_, and everyone else is either
wrong or agrees with us.  I suppose you may be reading and asking yourself,
"uhm, what was the point I already knew all of that...", and I have no
answer.  Well, other than the fact that if it really didn't interest you,
you wouldn't have read this far into the article, would you have?

I suppose we could argue that too..
