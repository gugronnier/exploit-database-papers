                        More Lame Legislation
                        ---------------------

This information needs to be spread and acted upon. Read on...

The following information is from the AFT Legislation Dept.:

-----------------------------------------------------------------

Tuesday, June 25 is "Call Congress Day" to oppose passage of
S.984 and H.R.1946, the Parental Rights and Responsibilities Act
(PRRA). In spite of its title, the PRRA is dangerous legislation
which would be extremely destructive to public education, open
schools and teachers to the threat of lawsuits, and jeopardize
health and welfare programs for children.

Background. H.R.1946 was introduced in the House by Congressman
Steve Largent (R-OK) and its companion bill, S.984, was
introduced in the Senate by Senator Charles Grassley (R-IA). On
April 17, 1996, S.984 was approved 4-3 by a Senate Judiciary
subcommittee.

Summary. The PRRA states that no federal, state or local
government "shall interfere with or usurp the right of a parent
to direct the upbringing of the child." Parental rights include
directing or providing for a child's education, making health
care decisions for a child, providing discipline for a child, and
directing or providing for the child's religious teaching. The
bills would allow any parent to bring a lawsuit in federal or
state court challenging any policy, program or activity. The
suits would be examined under the highest judicial standard --
i.e., the government, would have to demonstrate that the program,
policy or activity services a compelling government interest and
is the narrowest and least restrictive means of accomplishing the
interest.

Action Needed -- Call In Day. On June 25, the Christian Coalition
will be visiting offices on Capitol Hill, lobbying in support of
the PRRA. In order to counteract the barrage of support, we urge
you to call your representative and senators on June 25 to oppose
the PRRA. You can use the AFT toll-free number (1-800-238-1727)
to reach the U.S. Capitol Switchboard. If you can't call on June
25, calls (or letters) at any time would be useful. Some talking
points on the PRRA follow.

Talking Points on the Parental Rights and Responsibilities Act
(PRRA):

--Although the "Parental Rights and Responsibilities Act " sounds
innocuous, this legislation would place the health, welfare,
education and safety of our nation's children at risk. The
legislation would allow any parent to challenge in court
virtually any decision of health and child welfare agencies,
libraries, and public schools. The proposal would undermine these
public institutions, jeopardize the access of children to health
care, thwart child labor laws, and threaten efforts to protect
children from abuse.

--Child welfare agencies, hospitals, community health clinics,
schools and other public institutions would be forced to divert
scarce resources needed to provide services to children and use
these funds to defend against litigation.

--The PRRA makes parents the only judge of what is appropriate
for their children in education and empowers them to demand it
from schools. The law invites parents to sue schools -- and
teachers and school employees -- over any element of the school's
curriculum, programs or activities that they may disagree with.
Any course, any book assigned, any test given, any school rule
enforced could be challenged by parents as interfering with the
parental right to direct the education of the child.

--Under the PRRA, schools could be forced to design an
individualized curriculum for any or every student. Parents could
demand that their child be taught creationism, for example, or
any other special alternative that reflects the values of the
parents. Parents could also simply insist that their child be
permitted to opt out of any required course they don't like --
English, social studies, biology, you name it.

--Under the PRRA, parents could challenge any school district
policies or rules with which they disagree -- no pass/no play,
student hair and dress codes, teacher grading decisions, or basic
health care in schools, such as hearing and vision testing, and
sports physicals.

--The legislation is an unfunded mandate of the worst kind. The
costs to schools and other public agencies of defending lawsuits
and developing individualized curricula or services could run to
billions of dollars a year.

--Individual educators would also be at financial risk, since
they could be taken to court and found personally liable for
anything they teach which is contrary to the values of individual
parents. Educators could face financial consequences for teaching
evolution, or even Romeo and Juliet, which deals, with suicide
and disobedience to parents, or Macbeth (witchcraft). This will
certainly have a chilling effect on education.

--Proponents of private school vouchers intend to use the PRRA to
promote public funding of vouchers. They believe enactment of the
PRRA would make it easier to win in court by arguing that
vouchers are the best way to allow parents to "direct the
education" of their children.
