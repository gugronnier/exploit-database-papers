                     Jehovah, Lord of the Universe
                     -----------------------------
 
     We watch three kings approach the stable. They look inside to find 
the newborn child. They brought gifts for the this king of kings. They 
look upon the child with knowing eyes, some day, this being will do 
something great for all humanity. They then turn their attention to the 
mother, who is looking down upon her baby with crystal eyes. What a 
wonder this child is.
 
     As the baby grows older, he turns his attention to the work of God. 
Many begin to say that he is the Messiah, some think of him as nothing 
more than a rumor. Either way, he does what he does, he talks to his 
father and then relays what is said to his people.
 
     As an adult he gets a handful of followers, ones that he calls 
his disciples. Other people had begun to hear his word, and follow his 
path. He predicts the future with great accuracy. He performs many 
miracles and brings happiness to many people who otherwise would suffer.
 
     However he is ridiculed by many also. Those that say he is nothing, 
he is just the teller of lies to get those that are weak minded to 
follow him. They want him executed, they are the greedy pigs that fear 
he is right, they are the corrupted souls that are blinded by their ego 
and purses. They put him in front of the government, they want him 
killed. It doesn't matter, the government cares for him not, they wash 
their hands of the man. It doesn't matter, for his seed is already 
planted.
 
     His word will spread through the words of his disciples. He knows 
it, he can see it. There will be wars in his name. Thousands upon 
thousands of people will die because of his actions. He has begun a new 
way of life. He will bring happiness to many and slavery to all. He has 
effected this world greatly, and for that he has done what he has come 
for. He sees all of this as he hangs there, nailed to a cross. And now.. 
he is dying.. slipping awa..y... come..ing.... ba..c.....k......
     He awakes in a sudden jerk. "I did it" thinking to himself, as a 
huge smile covers his face. Listening to the outside of the dark 
chamber, he hears nothing. "Good, they didn't catch me..." as that 
thought wanders from his head he quietly opens the door. Much to his 
surprise, the General is waiting for him. If that wasn't enough to ruin 
his plan, it was the 20 guns pointed at his head.
     The General spoke "Just what in the hell were you trying to 
accomplish?"
     "I have done it.. I did it.. They followed me. They are fools!" 
     "Jehovah, let me explain something to you. Our scientists created 
this universe because..." looking at a scientist across the room "Why in 
the hell did you make this?"
     "So we could study the way our own universe was created, and 
possibly how it will end." replied the scientist with a slightly nasal 
voice. 
     "Yeah, what he said" continued the General, "The point is, it was 
not made so you could play make believe! They would have destroyed the 
damn thing right then and there but..." the General waited for the 
scientist to complete his sentence.
     "Oh, because life developed quicker than they expected. The time 
inside this universe was going much faster than our ow--" 
     "--yeah yeah yeah. It means that we can't destroy it so we have to 
guard it. This job has been on the boring side until you pulled this 
little stunt. Now, what exactly did he do?"
     Another scientist popped out of a back room. As he entered one 
could see many terminals lit up as status displays ran across the 
glass. "He screwed that harmless planet all up! That's what he did!" 
shouted the man as he quickly entered with a long print out dragging on 
the floor. 
     "HA!" Jehovah shouted in the direction of this new comer "It was 
far from harmless. They were all mindless beings. They were asking for 
someone like me. That's why I did it in the first place. They kept 
asking for someone to come and---"
     "Wait!" Shouted the General, "Just tell me what he did."
     "Ok," continued the scientist, "He went to a planet we call 
FortusNax III. The people that inhabit the planet call it Earth. He made 
them all believe he was God. Our reports indicate that a massive 
religion has been started following him. And just before I came in here 
I was reading reports of a second large scale war. All because of him."
     "Well shit, I don't know whether to admire you or throw you in the 
dungeon. Can you explain to me, without making yourself look like more 
of a lunatic, just why in the sam-hell you did this?"
     "First, tell me what year it is.." Jehovah said in an excited 
state, as he was about to unlock enough energy to power all the world 
for a year. 
     "What, are you stupid?" replied the General in a confused state.
     "The year on Earth!" as he kept the oversized smile on his face.
     "Uuummmm..." the scientist voice trailed off as he entered into the 
back room from which he came. "It is.... 1958." He shouted as his voice 
was muffed by the walls.
     "Its almost time!" Jehovah said as he was almost jumping off the 
walls. 
     "Time for what? What in the hell is he talking about!?" the General 
asked to anyone with a slightly higher IQ than himself who could figure 
this whole thing out. As expected, no one answered.
     Then it happened. Jehovah leaped for the door to the chamber, 
opening and closing it as quickly as he could. Over half of the guards 
aimed to fire.
     "NO! STOP!" Shouted the nasal scientist, "You will destroy the 
linking chamber if you fire! All our observers on the planets will be 
lost!" The guards stood down.
     A Light on the side of the door powered up. As it suddenly turned 
off a red light above the door came on.
     "Is there anyway to get him out of there?" impatiently asked the 
General. 
     "No, once you start the linking chamber you can't stop it." The red 
light turned off. "He's now on Earth, someone can go after him, we can 
try and put you in the same part of the world as him." explained one of 
the scientists.
     "Ok," the General started, "I am going after this little shit. Once 
he comes out of there, shoot him." he explained to his officers, "What 
year will I be arriving in?" he shouted.
     "1999." answered the scientist from the other room. "And he arrived 
in 1996. Apparently he didn't go through the birth process so we are 
going to skip that for you also. Good luck."
     "I will see you soon." said the General as he made his was to the 
linking chamber. Opening the door, you can see his service ID tattooed 
on his head, a common practice of military men on Trutus IV. It reads 
"666"
