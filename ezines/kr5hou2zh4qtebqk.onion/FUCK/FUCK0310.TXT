                         rachmaninov's dream
                         -------------------

i walked outside my house this morning, the sky was falling, and god was
no where to be found. i walked down between the cracks newly formed around
the earth. there i found an old man with a wooden beard hiding in a chilly
black tunnel. he pointed beyond the gates of hell and asked "when was the
last time you opened a book and saw the fell words of madness dance upon
your mind? how can you name the wickedness any other title then yourself?
these are the ways infinity is formed and darkness begins to prevail."
this man could be no other then the eternal, so i asked him for the
meaning of life. he looked pale within my eyes and responded only "we're
trading places." have no faith but that of endless change, and hold no
truths but that of trickery. this is the time worth waiting for, this is
the end of the beginning and the conquest of the departed. i felt a sharp
stab from realization as my groundlings began to huddle. the old man spoke
once more "this existence is now yours my love. treat it as i have treated
you", and then dove beyond the boundaries of imagination. i began to speak
"my fine dominions, come now to the surface. we shall embark all mindless
men with death, and give those that long, the answer to reality.  a new
book shall be formed, and shall be filled with truth. hear the new age of
i, and feel the old pain of tomorrow. with our new beginning we shall hold
these mortal coils with a gentle hand. we shall emerge great palaces
across the world, bring back the face of fantasy and dictatorship.  once
order is conquered this earth shall remain cold and still, as a moon
without a world. i alone hold the future and will bring great peace
through my treachery.  no soul fumbling through this existence shall have
stance against me. and so arise! arise great visages onto the earth! we
shall walk across the face o' it and bring order to all! hold your shadows
close dear friends for the sun shall never rise again!"
