                                The Protester
                                -------------
                                     #134

        The protester is 45, has six children, and drives a school bus for 
a living.  She says her prayers every night, goes to church every Sunday, and
dutifully takes care of her husband and children with love and care.
She was a virgin when she married and never even considered birth control.
On her days off she arms herself with a large sign depicting an
infant with its head severed and drives to her local abortion clinic.
While she is there she does her civic and religious duty.  Namely, she
shouts screams of rage and hatred for all the women entering the clinic, the
baby killers and child murderers.  Once the doctor arrives, she shouts 
a few well chosen phrases, most involving his inevitable afterlife in hell
as a child killer.  Then she gets in her car and drives home.  She feels
proud of herself for doing her duty.

        She loves her job.  She loves all those shining faces of children
she sees every day, and feels that she knows most of them well.  Take Brad.
He is 8 years old, retarded, and has a dull look to his eyes and an
oddly shaped head.  His mother did crack during her preganacy, and could
not afford an abortion.  She needed the money for drugs.  Brad will live
as close to a normal life as possible, considering he spent his first
months of life screaming and shivering, suffering from withdrawal from
crack cocaine.  The protester thinks he is a wonderful little boy, albeit
a tad slow.

        Then there is Melanie.  She seems normal enough, except for the
fact that she never smiles.  You see, her mom was raped at the age of 15,
and her father, a good Catholic man, forbade both abortion and adoption
as options.  Melanie's mom just cannot bring herself to truly love the
child who is the product of a brutal rape.  She takes care of her, feeds
her, and is trying to get her GED at the same time.  But still, whenver she
looks at Melanie's face, all she can think of is the man who took her
innocence from her.  The protester thinks that Melanie is the sweetest
girl she drives to school, even if she is a bit melancholy.

        Then there is Janey.  Janey is twelve, and has been living with her
adoptive family since she was 9 weeks old.  She is the only child in the
family.  She has bruises on her face a lot, and has already been pegnant
once.  She miscarried the child after about 14 weeks, probably because
her father raped her brutally the night of the miscarriage.  Her mother
pretends not to notice, but Janey notices, and lies awake at night
trembling in fear.  She hates it when her daddy hurts her.  The prostester
thinks that Janey must be an awfully clumsy girl who should be more
careful.

        Once the protester drops all of the children off at school she
thinks about how wonderful they all are and how proud of herself she is that
she spends her free time trying to save children like these.  Self-
satisfied, she goes off to live her daily life.  Brad, Melanie, and Janey
lived their lives too.  Brad did not graduate from high school.  He went
to home for the menatlly retarded and made bird feeders for money.  His
mother died when he was 17 from a crack cocaine overdose.  Melanie
tried to kill herself 8 times before she finally succeeded.  She left
a note saying "I wish I was never born."  And Janey murdered her
adoptive father at the age of 18.  She was deemed sane in court, so she
was tried as an adult and convicted of murder one.  She received the death
penalty at the age of 36 after all of her appeals were denied.  The
proetster continued to go to work, go to church, and visit the abortion
clinic, practicing good Christian values like hate, unacceptance,
unforgivingness, and emotional violence.  The protester has yet to
convince one woman not to have an abortion, but she still feels good
that she hurts these baby killers before they go and kill their children.
