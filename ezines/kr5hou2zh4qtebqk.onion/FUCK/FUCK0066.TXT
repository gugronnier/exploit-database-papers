                                Get a Job
                                ---------

        Have one? Want one? Need one? Is it the answer? Is it a real 
job? Looking for a better one? Any of that sound familiar to you? 

        Thing is, having a job doesn't mean shit anymore. It no longer
is a guarantee of money coming in. No longer does it mean you will be
able to support yourself, let alone your family. No longer does it
mean you can rely on company benefits to cover medical problems.
        It used to be that if you had a job, and had been with a business
or company for a year or so, you were pretty much set for life if you
wished. No matter what, you would usually stay there provided you
worked pretty hard and did pretty good. A while back there was no
worry about a company laying people off because of lack of business.
A few years in the company and some work above and beyond and you
could usually get a promotion of some sort. Pay increases were more
likely to happen, job benefits were greater etc.
        These days though, it is much different. You can work for
some business for a year, get no promotion, and little/no raise.
You are nothing more than a number to your superiors, and nothing
more than a statistic to corporate. You have to bust your ass to
keep your job since so many unemployed people are out there. If
you fuck up, you stand a good chance of loosing your job, or you
will be talked into quiting, or maybe even harassed into leaving.
Point is, unless you are management, your job isn't worth shit.

        BUT, these days, being a manager doesn't mean shit. Just a
few weeks ago, at the store I work at, our General Store manager
was fired with basically less than a days warning. Five members
of corporate level management came in, audited the store, looked
over some other stuff, then proceeded to fire the GSM, and the
RSM (Retail Sales Manager). These are the two biggest positions
in the store. We have a total of 9 managers, 70+ employees.
That shows you the responsability of these two people. Despite that,
both were gone, never to work for Tandy corporation again.
        The reason why? Doesn't much matter. Point is, both are gone
and had no warning. Neither were told 'You are fucking up, fix it'.
Neither were warned 'Hate to say this, but we have to let you go. You
have a couple days to find other employment.' Nothing. Now both
are out of a job, both with families to worry about.
        You may think 'Bah. Both were just high school grads, nothing
else going for them.' Maybe so, but look at the options presented
to college bound kids.
        
        1) College. Tens of thousands of dollars worth of debt.
           Graduation. _CHANCE_ of getting a stable job.
           Good starting pay, but takes years to advance since
           most people working with you have at least the same
           level of education. Spend first 5-10 years of that
           good job paying back for college loans.

        2) Graduate High School. Work. Spend 20 years working
           up through the company, pretty much guaranteed
           a stable job and stable income, albeit lower than
           many other options. Eventually become a store manager.
           If you have a clue, possible move on into a district
           level position. District Manger etc.
        
        These days, both have the potential to pay off. Neither of
them have a good chance of success really unless you work your ass
off in either one. You say why not work your ass off in college so
you have a better job when you get out? Because working your ass
off depends on your degree. For any degree that pays a good starting
salary, you have to pay more for the college that offers those classes.
So work your ass off, pay more, payback more. 
        No matter how you look at it, you are screwed it seems. So
if your parents or teachers are giving you shit about going to
college, think of the ups AND the downs. College isn't a little
yellow brick road like they lead you to believe.
        And believe me, working for a corporation and being a # or
statistic isn't much fun either. Just weigh your options and go with
what makes you happy. That is all that is important anymore and no
one cares about it.
