                              Psuedo-Article
                              --------------

     Recently, with the uprising of freedom on the internet, more and
  more zines have been circulating and have been reaching people that
  don't really seem to deserve the information. I know this really seems
  to defeat the point of zines - to provide information to the
  uninformed - but is everybody really mature enough to know most of
  what's out there?
     In both middle school and high school I've seen what I refer to as
  psuedo-anarchists, for lack of a better term. Everybody's met one.
  Remember back when Beavis and Butt-Head were moved to later at night
  partially because one of them kept going "Fire! Fire!"? Whichever one
  did that is the perfect example.
     Put simply, anarchy is a lack of government. But if you try asking
  a psuedo-anarchist what it is, the response will more than likely be
  "making bombs and stuff". God, what's wrong with these fools? Is it
  suddenly cool to light fires everywhere and do dumb shit like making
  pipe bombs and just lighting them for fun?
     Recently in Denver, I've heard about a teen who made a pipe bomb
  with two of his friends. He had filled it with match heads or whatever
  he decided to fill it with and then felt the urge to *hit it with a
  hammer*. Duh. Why? To seal off the end or something? A feeling that 10
  fingers is just too many? Planning on joining the Japanese mob?

     I think my point has come across. Some people just aren't capable
  of the minimal amount of self-control that it requires to posess such
  knowledge. And what's worse, knowing how to make bombs is near useless.
  When would you ever use this? Interested in starting your own faction?
  How about a hate militia? But people publish it because it's still
  interesting information to have, and it ends up in the wrong hands.
     Here's an excerpt from an un-named zine I read from. I've edited out
  anything that shows who this is from.

=C4=C4=C4=C4=C4=C4=C4=C4=C4=C4=C4=C4=C4=C4=C4 Peter Bergman once said "Resp=
ect must be earned, and the
only way to gain respect is by the spilling of blood."  That saying
still is true but in different aspects.  Now we have a place were age
doesn't matter sex doesn't matter, all that matters is knowledge.  Now
respect must be earned by formatting hard drives and destroying files.
You could be friends with some one who you never have met and as well
hate someone who you have never met. The time is now.  It is time to
over throw the powers at will a new era must be started the old hackers
of yesteryear must make way for the new generation. The days of
backdoors and secert passwords are over.  The time is now for
destruction. =C4=C4=C4=C4=C4=C4=C4=C4=C4=C4=C4=C4=C4=C4=C4=C4=C4=C4=C4=C4=

     (note the excellent spelling) Now, what the hell is this? Some rule
  book by a bunch of excited 13 year olds? A claim to what bad ass elite
  hackers they think they are?
     Please, if BBSes are going to be like this, shoot me. This is just...
  dumb. "Anarchy is the #1 goal." Yeah. Would be nice if you told us why
  exactly you're so interested in doing away with all government. "The
  Hackers of yesterday must subside or be silenced." Yeah, you go do that.
  I'll just sit here and watch. "Actions speak louder and harder than
  words." Wow, that looks neat. How about for your first action, you stick
  your tongue in an electric socket?
     I guess I don't really have anything to close this with except this
  is getting fucking ridiculous. When people start talking like this
  seriously, and blow their fingers off out of sheer idiocy, it means
  that we ought to start doing something. Limit information? Maybe. Make
  all BBSes private to keep fools like these out? Possibly. Just let the
  psuedo-anarchists blow each other up? That's as good as anything else.
     And if your answer to this problem is "bomb them and light them on=20
  fire", then it really has gone too far.
