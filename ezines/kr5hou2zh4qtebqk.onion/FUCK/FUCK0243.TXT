                   You Plottin' On Me Uncle Sam?
                   -----------------------------

 Hmmm...., here's an interesting thing:  What would you do to control
 several thousand adolescent males who were heavily armed, away from
 home, bored out of their skulls in a foreign country and at the peak
 of their hostile years?  I bet you'd offer them the things that were
 taboo back in their hometowns, hard to get and make them feel good
 about what they are doing.  Yeppers, I bet that you would make it easy
 as hell to accquire booze, broads and smokes.

 Seriously, over here in the Army in Europe, about the only people who
 aren't continually drunk are the IFOR troops in Bosnia right now...
 The rest of them...Not a problem, got something for them, gonna square
 them right away with a sixer or two.  Beer, by the six pack or the case
 here runs about half the price of beer in the world (USA) and is
 available to anyone who is a soldier.  God, not one weekend goes by that
 we don't have at least one alchohol related incident here just on my
 barracks.  Whether it is a DUI, fight, overly-loud party or some new
 guy almost killing himself from alchohol poisoning it happens like
 clockwork.  Now, I'm not just sitting back and passing judgement over
 my fellow soldiers here... I fell into the trap too.  For about the last
 year, I've existed from beer to beer night to night etc.  I can't count
 the number of times I've come to work reeking of Icehouse, Hefeweizen or
 my personal fave-rave Vodka.  It is bizarre the way it sneaks up on you
 too.

 I wonder if I would have noticed before I went back to the states if it
 hadn't been for a conversation some friends and I had about two weeks
 ago.  My friend Bill was the first to pull himself out of the "pit" by
 getting a new computer and beginning his first tentative wanderings into
 the World Wide Web.  Soon, he stopped heading out to the club with us and
 instead opted to do a little "geeking".  Of course, we all shook our heads
 at his new-found lameness and went on and kept getting drunk.  A few
 weeks later I was approached with an alternative to going out and killing
 brain cells at the bottom of a bottle.  I got to try (for the first time)
 Ecstasy (MDMA) and to say the least it was an interesting thing...

 For the first time in I don't know how long I was clear headed.  My
 friends and I sat around and discussed WWII history (my favorite),
 politics, women and all of that stuff for about 5 hours before it wore
 off.  It was bizzare.  I couldn't remember the last time I had had that
 much fun.  I mean, I had been going through the motions of having fun
 with my friends and company, but in retrospect it was just drinking
 until I blacked out about 4 nights a week.  Man.  I dunno.  I felt good
 the whole week.  I enrolled in two college classes, started thinking for
 myself again.  I was cleaning the hull of my tank with a sponge and I
 was happy as hell just thinking to myself about all kinds of things.
 Wow, it is good to have a mind again...

 Another thing... The women here.  God.  This town I live in...  The
 women here are nothing but brood mares.  I walk around the clubs and
 just to look at them makes me feel vaguely ill.  I don't know why.  I've
 hit on some of them, slept with some of them and all in all it was about
 as exciting as fucking a hunk of meat.  I realize that this has to be the
 dream of the majority of these guys over here tho.  To come to a place
 where many many women will fuck you because you are American and there
 is that unspoken hope that you will fall in love and take them back to
 the World so they can shop at malls and live the good life.  I know so
 many guys who come over here right out of High School and decide to make
 this a career because they get here, get drunk, get laid like they never
 did at home and still get a steady paycheck.  Eventually they end up
 planning to marry some German woman and next thing you know <BAM> they're
 going back to the world because of too many alcohol related incidents
 with some tubby German chick as a wife.  No education, no skills, a
 black mark on them because they got kicked out of the army and now, a
 family.

 I just can't stand stupid people.  I don't know why they all seem to
 congregate in the military.  You'd think with an all volunteer Army we
 could afford to be more selective.  But here they come.  They get
 cheap booze, cheap women who "love" them.  Hell, even ciagrettes are
 dirt cheap over here.  Uncle Sam deliberatly numbs its fighting force
 over here in USAEUR to keep them from thinking and realizing what a trap
 this is.  It's frightening in a way that the government would do that
 to its soldiers, but what is even scarier is that these yahoos let it
 be done to them of their own free will.  Of course, the worst part...
 These are the people who YOU pay your taxes to defend you and the world.
 Wow.
