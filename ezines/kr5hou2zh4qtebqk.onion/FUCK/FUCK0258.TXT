                        The Psychology of Presence
                        --------------------------

I finished college two years ago, and it was not a very pleasant experience. 
It was bad enough that, to this day, while having the desire for a second 
degree, I would never seriously consider returning to college.

I am a knowledge junkie. The popularity of the Internet and World Wide Web 
would have people define this as someone addicted to the Web. But, I am 
different. I hate the Web. Biology. Chemistry. Mathematics. Philosophy. 
Psychology. Sociology. These are the subjects which interest me, and college 
prevented me from learning them.

All colleges have a policy which stipulates that the grade one ultimately 
receives must be based, in part, upon a certain pre-defined attendance 
rate. In order to recieve a "C" in any class, you must attend at least 
70% of the class sessions, regardless of all other factors. You may be 
earning a perfect "A" in the class, but if you only attended 70% of the 
lectures, you will be recieving a "C" instead. 

On the surface, this seems like a reasonable policy. The more lectures you 
attend, the more you will learn. The less you attend, the less you will 
learn. But, this policy is seriously flawed, and it is destroying the 
academic records of many students.

I do not restrict my learning solely to the classroom. While others can be 
found in the local bookstore perusing the best-seller of the week, I can 
be found in the science section debating whether I should buy a book on 
chaos theory, or a book on human anatomy. If I am able, I purchase them 
both, and eagerly run home to begin learning something new.

A student often registers for his next-semester class schedule several 
months in advance. Being excited about learning a new subject, I would  
often return to the bookstore to buy something along the lines of my 
future class subjects. By the time I appeared for the first day of class, 
I usually had a solid background on what was to come.

Instructors spend way too much time beating the same basic principles to 
death. The class moves slowly as a result, and those who understood the 
concept earlier are quickly bored. Those who understood it months earlier 
become extremely bored. When a sharp student asks a thoughtful and 
intelligent question on the topic at hand, and the rest of the class may 
not understand it yet, the anger of others becomes readily apparant. 
Some think you are just trying to show off. You lose faith in your ability 
to learn what you need from the class. You start missing classes. Eventually, 
you only do the homework and show for the tests.

I failed many classes in college. I failed the same philosophy class twice. I 
failed because I never attended class. I completed all of the assignments on 
time. I took every quiz and test. I read the entire textbook...twice. I often 
called the instructor on weekends to debate very esoteric topics of 
philosophy, ethics and society. She said she had learned a couple of things 
from our debates. She said I knew my subject cold. At the end of the 
semester, I had 997 out of 1000 possible points. I received an "F" in the 
class based on my 28% attendance rate. She was upset that she was forced to 
give me this grade.

This scenario played out in every class, every semester. Then I took 
Psychology. On the first day of class, we filled out the basic questionaire 
as to who we were, what we wanted to do with our lives, and what our 
interests were. We turned them in, and after glancing through them, she 
called a few students outside for a few minutes each. I was one of them.

"You don't belong here," she said. "Get out of here. See me during office 
hours later this week."

Wondering what was going on, I went to her office a few days later. Why would 
an instructor throw me out of her class without cause?

"You're too smart to be wasting away in this class. You stated your interest 
was in medicine on your questionaire. I want you to read the textbook and 
show up for all of the quizzes and tests. Other than that, I don't want to 
see you in class. But, since the law requires a certain amount of hours in 
the classroom to receive a grade, this is what we are going to do. You will 
spend one hour for each hour of class you miss researching any topic you want 
tying psychology with medicine. Then write me a report. Keep a log of your 
hours. Agree?"

I could not believe what I was hearing. This was too good to be true! "Yes." 
I said to her, and went home.

I did what was asked of me. I missed 51 hours of class, yet spent 132 hours 
researching and writing a report on "The Psychology of Steroid Abuse in 
Athletes." I received an "A" on every quiz and test. I received an "A" on my 
report. I received an "A" in the class. I was ecstatic!

This instructor somehow recognized a student that shouldn't have been there. 
She had an alternate idea, and it worked for the both of us. I had learned 
more about psychology than any student could ever have learned by attending 
every class and taking notes. And it gave me hope for my other classes.

The following semester I approached each of my instructors on the first day 
of class with this idea in mind. None of them wanted to hear it. It was 
ludicrous to them. I had to attend class or fail. End of story.

By definition, the grade of "A" means "demonstrated mastery of the course 
subject and material." Colleges don't care about the definitions contained in 
their own policy guidelines. So what if you are a master of "subject x" or 
"subject y?" So what if you are doing "A" level work. You missed "x" number 
of classes, so you are getting an "F." This is contrary to the definition of 
"A" work. Where is the logic in this?

Smart students with a desire to learn are being destroyed by irrational 
policies like attendance requirements. I graduated with a GPA of 2.02. I 
should have graduated with a 3.80+ GPA. I received offers from almost every 
one of my current, and previous, instructors for "Letters of Recommendation." 
I became friends with many of my instructors, and even some I never took a 
class from. But my desire for knowledge destroyed me. I was different. I 
didn't conform. And I was punished for it.
