				Why Do It?
				----------

I finished this yesterday whenI ran across it. I began writing it more than
four years ago, didn't finish it, and forgot about it. Looking through old
disks I found it, finished it, and thought you might like it.

--------

"Why Do It?" - Disk Jockey/WR

Why do it?

Why spend hours on end, on computers, on the telephone, doing what we do?
Why fight the system when we could take the system's conforts?
Why stand up for rights we know will not be upheld?
Why bother with such a hopeless cause?
Why continue a struggle we cannot win?

We know the government tells us that what we do is wrong.
They say that it is against the law and even morally wrong.
The possible consequences of our actions do not bother us.
Our friends go off to jail as we watch, caught by society.
No more friends, but enemies, created to stop the rest of us.

So I ask again.
Why do it?

Is it for the sheer fun of it?
Is it for the mental challenge?
Is it out of contempt for authority?
Is it out of need for free service?
Is it partly all of the above?

We risk our freedom, our safety, and at times our lives, to do these things.
We do them, sometimes with, and other times without, respect of the victims.
These people usually have no knowledge of our actions.
In most cases our actions have no damage whatsoever.
More often than not we are very helpful to those we have "criminalized".

And still I ask.
Why do it?

Do these people deserve what we do to them?
Are we so involved in principle that we don't see the repercussions?
Is all of the government a conspiracy, aimed at quashing free thought?
Will free expression soon become a thing of the past?
Are we the knights in armor of modern times, protecting the electronic kingdom?

With our intelligence we could have sheltered and good lives for ourselves.
Some of us do, others do not.
These great minds, used for criminal activities.
Sometimes we learn a great deal from these, more than school teaches.
And yet we still go out on a limb to do what we do.

So the question is still not resolved.
Why do it?

Most of us are free of the binds of common society.
No prejudice, no animosity, none of this burdens us.
And some even have a greater understanding of others than the common person.
There are those that don't share this freedom.
Those people don't last long in our world.

Out of paranoia we give no one absolute trust.
This is the underground, the place that no one sees.
The place that has no definite location, but still exists nonetheless.
We gather at this place to trade information, our primary commodity.
Information we gathered through means not permitted by our government.

Again the question burdens.
Why do it?

Someday we may understand why we do these things.
There might be an underlying meaning or purpose to our actions.
There might not.
We do have one thing in common, that no one can break.
The need to keep our movement going.

Until the government grants us the freedom we seek,
Until we can teach the world the true meaning of learning,
Until time reaches a turning point in society,
Until peace is the standard of living,
We must continue.

Even with these statements, I ask one last time.
Why do it?
