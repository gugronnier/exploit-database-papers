=  F.U.C.K. - Fucked Up College Kids - Born Jan. 24th, 1993 - F.U.C.K.  =

                               Starter

   What is F.U.C.K. you ask? Ok. So you don't. You probably think it a 
bunch of losers that write stupid text files about boring shit right? Ha!
wrong. Actually, the group is really small right now as it is just forming 
but that doesn't mean the quality of the files will be down or boring.
Anyway, we are a small group of college kids that don't exactly fit into
many parts of society or whatnot, we all BBS, and we all look down upon
many parts of the shithole we are forced to live in. Society doesn't like
us and we don't exactly care for society.
   Doc Z and I were sitting in IHOP one night and decided that it would be
cool to start a line of text files so our thoughts could be read by many 
people. All of the members have or have been exposed to the cDc files and
we all know that they are widely known and respected in parts of this 
country. I have read all of them, and the other members have read most or
all of them. The cDc files are what gave us the idea of a line of files. 
First, we don't plan on copying cDc, taking any of their wisdom away, or 
anything like that. Our text files will be quite different and usually on
a slightly more serious note. Not really serious but they are designed to
either make you think about something or laugh about something. Anyway,
a lot of thanks goes out to Swamp Ratte' and the cDc file authors for their
time that made us want to do these.
   If things work out well, you will see one or two F.U.C.K. files a week
but don't hold your breath. If one of us have time we will put one out and
hopefully it will be read by a few people. Anyway, each file will be named 
FUCK####.TXT and they will go in order from 1 to whatever. We hope that no
one will alter any of the files in any way so that they may be seen in their
original form. Original files can be DLed at no cost from The BackYard.
   Who knows how far this line of files might go. For all we know we may
grow to be like 115 years old and on file number 8472 or something. Course, 
we may also stop after number 6 or something stupid but I think they will
go a little ways. All of the views and shit in these files are our own views
of things and our surroundings. Hopefully you will read them and begin to 
think about what we are babbling about and realize stuff about your 
surroundings that you had never seen or realized before.
   The thing that bothers me the most and has sorta driven me to write about
it is the fact that people are so damn unaware of their surroundings. People
think only of themselves and don't give a shit about other people. Usually it
isn't that they don't give a shit, but that they don't realize that their 
actions have a direct influence on other people. Usually this amounts to be 
a small inconvenience but it all adds up and begins to bother people. They 
shout obscenities or whatnot at whoever did it and more hate is displayed.
Bah. So anyway, read the files, take them however you want to and do what 
you will, but just stop and think about it for a minute. Just doing that 
might actually help this pitiful world out somewhat. That's all for me.

   I hope that you will feel that it is always worth while to read the
F.U.C.K. files.  I know that I'm not personally trying to change the world
but I am trying to get people to see it through my glasses.  I'll try to 
spread a little down home wisdom laced with a bit of culture.  I feel that 
Scourge pretty much summed up everything else.  I'm still waiting for Godot.
