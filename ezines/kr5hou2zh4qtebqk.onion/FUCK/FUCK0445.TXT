                       anger
                       -----
 
                                                        one
 the son was walking out of the store with the father,
 just after buying a few groceries. suddenly the
 father stepped on the man's left shoe who was walking
 rather slowly in front of the father. the man turned
 his black face around and said "why don't you slow
 down a little there, huh?" as jericurl dripped onto
 the man's shoulder. the man gave the father a look of
 annoyance and turned around slowly and began  walking 
 away. suddenly a bomb went off in the sons head. the 
 son walked over to the man who was now just minding 
 his own business. 
 
 "hey!" shouted the son. the man turned around as the
 father approached the son.
 
 "what are you doing?" said the father. 
 
 "no one gets away with that, the father, no one." the
 son marched over to the man now standing with a
 puzzled look upon his face. 
 
 "why did you look at the father like that? why you
 piece of shit? no one gave the man permission to look
 at the father like that, and you need the son's
 permission before you can. i didn't hear the man ask
 me permission, so you are going to apologize to the
 father right the fuck now!" the son pounded his words
 into the man's ears.
 
 "man, fuck you and the father!" replied the man as he
 slowly turned away, as if the conversation was over.
 
 at that moment nothing existed but revenge, and
 hatred. the son grabbed the back of the man's head,
 gripping onto his wet hair. the son swung the man
 around and threw his head against a wall. after
 breaking the man's nose against the hard concrete he
 feel to the ground in pain. the father looked on with
 disbelief. then the son put his hands against the
 wall and used all the force in his body to
 continually kick the man in the stomach and ribs. by
 the time the father was able to pull the son off the
 man who was unconscious and bleeding to death.
 getting a better look at the man the father saw blood
 coming from his mouth and noticed his pulse was
 almost non-existent. just as the father turned to ask
 the son what he had done the son was gone, he was
 nowhere to be found.
 
 the father stayed around to talk to the police, and
 make sure the man was going to live. the father gave
 the police all the information they needed. a warrant
 was put out for the arrest of the son. the man did
 not live to see the next day. 
 
                                                        two
 the son was walking down a beat up old alley when he
 found the dealer. the son looked at the dealer, and
 he could see the son's red eyes. 
 
 "the son, i don't know what you have had but it looks
 like some good shit." said the dealer, trying to get
 a new customer. the look of hatred did not leave the
 sons face as the next words came from his mouth. 
 
 "you sell these drugs to the people? you sell these
 drugs?" the dealer was becoming confused. 
 
 "not so loud the son! look, if you want something we
 can do business, but don't --" "-- fuck with me!"
 yelled the son as he hit the dealer on the back of
 his head. the son saw a gun sticking out of the
 dealer's pants.  the son grabbed it and put it to the
 dealer's head. 
 
 "so you like to string up little kids? you like to do
 this thing you do, the dealer? does it make you happy
 to destroy and murder the people?" the son had the
 gun cocked and ready to fire, pressed hard against
 the dealer's ear. 
 
 "i don't know what you're talking about the son,
 don't kill me, don't do it the son. i'm just trying
 to survive." the dealer was crying, with his face
 towards the ground, cowering in fear. 
 
 "survive this!" the gun exploded in shards of relief
 as the bullet struck into the dealer's head. the son
 heard one of the people scream in the distance so he
 began to walk away.
 
                                                        three
 walking away with his new gun the son kept his
 melancholy face a view. as the son began to walk out
 of the alley the police pulled up behind him. 
 
 "stop!" the police yelled as their doors swung open
 and their bullets became chambered. the son turned
 around and slowly stepped towards the alley, trying
 to decide if he could make a run for it. the police
 slowly began walking towards the son. 
 
 "ok, just put your hands on your head and lay down on
 the ground." the police instructed. the son had no
 choice at this point but to comply. the son put his
 hands behind his head and slowly moved to the ground.
 the police began walking over very cautiously. 
 
 "we understand that there is something wrong with
 you. the father explained to us that he believes you
 to be severely ill. there are the people who can help
 the son. just remain calm and we will take you with
 us."  the police said as they tried to convince the
 son of their good intentions, which numbered zero. 
 
 "we can do this the easy way or the hard way, it is
 up to you." it was amazing how quickly the police
 died. no one was expecting it, especially the son who
 laid on the ground with his gun gripped in his right
 hand. 
 
 "i'll take the easy way." said the son as he got up
 off the ground and brushed himself off.
 
                                                        four
 "the father?" the son thought as he began walking
 home. "why would the father talk to the police about
 me?" it was a long walk. the son had to walk half way
 across town in order to get home. it was dark when
 the son arrived. the son unlocked and opened the door
 to the father's house. the son walked in and looked
 around. the father sat on the couch staring into a
 candle's flame which was the only source of light in
 the entire house. 
 
 "my the god, where have you been, the son?" the
 father asked as he rose up from the couch.
 
 "why did you tell the police what i did, the father?"
 the son returned the question as he looked upon the
 father with astonishment. 
 
 "what did you want me to do, the son? you killed the
 man who did not deserve to die for what he did." the
 father answered as though this reasoning should be
 obvious to the son. 
 
 "the man deserved to die. the son protects the people
 he loves. the son protects them from hurt." the son
 replied in a psychotic tone. "i love the son above
 all others now, and the father hurt the son by
 telling the police. just as the man hurt the father."
 the son looked at the father as though this reasoning
 should be obvious to him. 
 
 "hold on a second, now just calm down, everything is
 going to be ok." the father begin talking quickly.
 then the father fell to the ground, as his blood
 coated the wall behind him. 
 
 "yes, everything is going to be ok, the son will see
 to that." the son grinned as he looked over the
 father's dead body.
 
                                                        five
 the son swung open the door to the father's house and
 began running. the son ran about two blocks down to
 another house. a house the son had been to over a
 hundred times. the son hopped the fence and made his
 way to an unlocked window in the back of the house.
 the son had been through it over a hundred times. the
 son climbed through and made his way to a bedroom. a
 bedroom the son had been to over a hundred times. the
 son opened the door, walked through the dark room and
 sat on the bed. suddenly the form under the covers
 awoke and saw the son sitting above her. 
 
 "oh, it's you. you scared the hell out of me, what
 are you doing here this late?" the love threw one of
 her pillows at the son as she smiled. 
 
 "i have come to see the love. the son needs to talk."
 the son said now taking on a serious tone.
 
 "not again." the love mumbled under her breath. 
 
 "no, the love, not again." the son replied. 
 
 "then what is it, the son? why have you come here in
 the middle of the night?" the love asked with a
 confused look on her face. 
 
 "i have finally figured out a way to work things out.
 i have finally found a way to make everything ok."
 the son said, reassuring the love of his intentions.
 "you see, the love hurt the son. the love hurt the
 son deeply." 
 
 "the love never meant to hurt the son. the love never
 felt that way towards the son. the son hurt the son
 by falling for the love." the love replied, as though
 trying to make the son understand something he
 already did. 
 
 "i know, the son knows all to well. however now the
 son will fix everything. the love hurt the son,
 therefore the love must die." and blood painted the
 window. "the son hurt the son, therefore the son must
 die." and more blood painted the window. 


rage-303 .. this is the end, my only friend the end.
