                         How to Become an Addict
                         -----------------------

     When seeing the likes of Bob Dylan or Jim Morrison using drugs or
alcohol to improve their way of living, one must want to feel the mind
altering effects that these chemicals have.  I am going to make a fictional
character called Don Wylan, Don will go through the process of becoming an
addict.  If he follows these three simple steps he will be living the exciting
lifestyle of being chemically dependent.  These steps are as follows: starting
out finding his drug of choice and self medication.

     When starting out as an addict Don must look at te two main drugs of
choice, alcohol and marijuana.  First without a doubt the most used is alcohol.
Alcohol amounts in beverages ranging from 3.2% to 60% in content.  Don is shy
and is wanting to talk to that special person that Don wants to take out on
a date, then alcohol is his best bet.  With the constent use of alcohol his
embaressing moments will fade away and self cofidence will be stronger then
ever.  The second most popular drug is marijuana, this drug can be very
usefull to Don because he is an overachiver and is easily stressed out.  It is
not really cheap anymore, but is very high in its active ingerdient THC.
Marijuana will take and rearange Don's priorities.  Don is kinda thin
and marijuana will fix this because he now craves salt and fat.

     Now Don is ready to moive the more mind altering substance.  The first
drug that Don is going to try is herion.  After shooting up herion Don feels
his mind being drained of all of its will power and he feels like life has
literally become "just a dream."  Don now tries crystal methane and sees
the world in a different light.  He sees peoples vibes actually surround them.
His lamp started to give Don its point of view.  Don really doesn't care for
crystal methane as much as herion though.  Now that Don has an outgoing
personality (thanks to the basic block of alcohol) he tries cocain.  It really
modifies his personality, people seem to enjoy his company and presence more
and more.  Don has learned that cocain is very good for parties and other
social events.  Now Don tries Speed.  WOW! This stuff really gives him an
adrinaline rush and causes him to go out and do really stupid things like
shoplift.  Don doesn't really care for speed too much because it puts him
more on edge than he needs to be and causes him paranoia.  Finally Don tries
crack, when he tried it, it litteraly took him to other places, it felt like
he was on the bridge of the enterprise, going to other worlds.

     Now Don is starting to feel the side effects of using his drugs of chocie.
He now has to do what is known as "self-medication".  This is extermly dangerous
because Don could lose the effect that he so desires from his drug of choice
herion.  Don has figured out that the best time to do this is when he is
feeling the unwanted effects of his drug of choice.  He won't take them at the
same time because Don's friend Jack took two drugs at the same time and ended
up in the hospital, then ended up in rehab... which for Jack was a living hell.

     Now Don has reached the point of being drug dependent.  He lives the ups
and downs and is constantly avoiding reality.  Don fills with joy when looking
upon his past with drugs.  He remembers all the women that adored him while
he was drinking.  The fun in expermenting with all kinds of drugs to find that
one drug that fits him the best.  While all the time not needing any material
goods, just food and heat and his drug of choice.  He wonders why others are
not doing this as well.

     Unfortunatly Don passed away.  One day he ripped off his dealer and his
dealer gave him some 'bad shit' in return.  Later that night Don broke out
his new stash and shot up like usual. We will remember Don for his fortitude
in the pursuit of denial of reality. Rest in peace, Don.
