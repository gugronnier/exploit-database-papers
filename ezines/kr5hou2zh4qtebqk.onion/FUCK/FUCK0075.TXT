                                General Info
                                ------------
        If you are a sysop of a board, and want to carry the F.U.C.K. files
you do NOT have to be an official distribution site. All we ask is that
you carry them. If you do want to become an official site, you must make
a seperate directory for the files. When files are uploaded, use this format:
FUCK0001.TXT  F.U.C.K. File 1 - Where it all Begins   *or*
FUCK0001.TXT  F.U.C.K. Vol. 1 - Where it all Begins   *or* 
FUCK0001.TXT  Where it All Begins
Include the title, and make sure they are free to download. That is the 
only way they will get out and circulated.
        For the time being, there will be no more than three dist. sites
in any given area code. If you run an official dist. site, it is encouraged
that you have an account on one of the HQ so you have access to the files
as they are released. The writers try to UL them to the dist. sites, but
may not always have the chance.

                              Few other Things
                              ----------------

        Lots of SHIT happening in 303 recently. Won't say much on what
has happened, but you may have noticed that Flatline and Undercity
are no longer Dist. Sites. Those boards are down for now, but not
forgotten. They will not be up for a while for individual reasons, so
don't bother calling. Cyber Rock is also down, as you may have read
in one of the files.
        One other thing. After you read this, go out and find the
files titled COTNO#.ZIP, download them, read them, and spread them
around. That stands for Communications of The New Order. 

        Peace.
