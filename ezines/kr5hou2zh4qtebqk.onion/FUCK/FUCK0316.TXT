                        Drowning in Rights
                        ------------------

America, the land of opportunity, where one can enjoy the many rights
and freedoms of a democratic society. The land of rights, many rights
of which we have and can use. But have we gone too far? We are
swimming in so many rights that we may be sinking. We need to have
rights. It would be foolhardy not to. Where would this country be
without them? Another oppressed society under a ruthless dictatorship?
Quite possible.

On the other hand, have we gone overboard with our rights? We seem to
be mired in them. It seems impossible to do or say anything without
violating somebody's rights and then getting sued by them for it.

We have the right of freedom of speech, to voice our opinions, and boy
do we ever! We continue to argue, rant, rave, discuss, banter back and
forth over problems and issues that sit and wait for solutions ( many
for decades ). Some, we just agree to disagree on, and others just
lurk on waiting for an answer.

We have the right to freedom of press......oh really? The government
now allows us access to information with the Freedom Of Infromation
Act. We can request documents of information of which they'll gladly
give to us, only after blacking out 99% of it, therefore rendering it
useless to its recipient. They use the ruse of "classified" or
"sensitive material to national security" to prevent you from finding
out what you wanted to know in the first place. Geez, alot of Freedom
there!! We get to read, watch, hear, surf the net, whatever we want.
Yeah right! We are slowly giving up that right because of parents that
are unwilling to monitor their own children and know want the
government to do it for them. Don't you think they'll gladly step in
and do it????

We have the right to bear arms........as long as the government knows
who has them, what they have, and how many.

Criminals have many, many, many rights. Oh but victims are getting
them now, long overdue. But who's side do the scales still tip to???
Alabama is bringing back their chain gangs for prisoners.....I say
HOORAY to them for it. But now the civil rights people are going to
take the whole thing to court for "cruel and unusual punishment"
HELLO, it is prison, not a country club. Aren't you supposed to pay
for your crimes instead of being coddled? Oh I agree that prisoners
are human beings that do deserve certain rights.......three hots and a
cot and work your ass off the rest of the time, and that's it. We
forget that many criminals are very intelligient. They use their
intelligence to manipulate the judicial system, and their unscrupulous
lawyers help them through gaping loopholes. It is their job I guess.

Animals have rights too, and they damn well need them. What other
defense do they have against man and his need to dominate every square
foot of the earth?

Employers in this country can't even fire incompetent employees for
fear of being sued for violating some sort of right.

Parents can't parent their kids because they have rights too. Try to
bring home a runaway if they don't want to come home, or see what
happens when you give your kid an old fashion swat on their butt.
You'll have CPS down on you in a second.

Minorities have rights too... blacks, hispanics,etc. Aren't we ALL
minorities in this country?? Do caucasians have rights? Women have
rights, do men? Just because I happen to be a caucasian male, don't I
have any rights? But I am a minority also, I have American Indian,
Dutch, English, and Irish blood. Just who is the majority here anyway?

I could go on and on, but I realize this post is rather long, and in a
society where many have the attention span of a gnat, it may not even
get read to this point. But I appreciate those of you that do! I have
no solutions to many of our ills nor pretend to. Just expressing my
opinion, after all it is my right!
