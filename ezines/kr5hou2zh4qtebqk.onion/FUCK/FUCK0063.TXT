                              How Do I Validate?
                              ------------------

        Do you ever wonder how sysops of private boards validate?
Beyond new user questionaires and validation letters, do you know
what they look for? What goes through their mind? If you are a sysop
then you probably know, but if not, then this might help you look
at it from a different point of view. The following is a small
letter I recieved in answer to that question. Think about it.

                                ---

    I get alot of people asking me how I validate, and why I care so 
much about it.  It may just be me, but I think that a user should have 
to 'earn' has access, and it is not given to him.  I like this because 
it give users more respect for the board, and makes them understand 
that access is a priviledge, not a right.  It also gives me a better 
idea of who I am dealing with.  Alot of people claim that I have an 
'elitist' additude, but they are just pissed because they can't get 
an account.  
    Another reason I do it is because I think BBSing is getting really 
lame.  New people start daily, and it just seems that CyberSpace is being 
corrupted by assholes, and other people that act like they run the place.
I would tell them to fuck off, but I am too nice for that.  I guess this
is what I am tring to say.  I am trying to make a haven for people that 
have been around a while, and know what they are doing, to not have to 
endure the same old bullshit, and be able to chat with users that they 
can't on other places.  If that makes me an 'elitist', then fuck you.
    Why should a user have more respect for my board then another?  
Well, considering that I have over 5000 files, and lots of other stuff 
that only my board has in this area code.  I also have alot of LD 
callers that pay for their charges, and they deserve a decent chance 
to get on.  They also don't need to see the local BS that is on all 
the other BBSes.

   When I validate, the first thing I do is look where they are calling 
from.  I have more respect for a user that is paying for the charges.  If
they say they are calling LD, then I check out the AC with the City they
claim to be calling from.  If they don't match, I delete them on the spot.
    Then I look at the New User Information.  I look at where they got the
NUP, and if it is a board, or net, I try to remember posting something 
like that.  If It is a person, I attempt to mail them, to ask where they 
got it from.  
    Then I look at the boards they use as references, and if they exist.  
If they do exist, then I try to call them within the month to check.  If 
they are dipshits, and but boards with numbers like XXX-PRI-VATE, I will
delete them on the spot.
    I look at how many users they claim that they have been modeming.  I 
like users that have been around, simply because I don't have to answer 
alot of stupid questions.  (I really hate 'Where are the GaMeZ D0oD?')
    If they run a board, I make an attempt to call it within the month,
just to make sure.  I also look at what software they run, the more complex,
the more it proves they know.  (WWiV is not complex)
    Then I look at the ancroyms.  I see how many of them they knew, and 
how many they skipped/bullshited.  The more they BSed on, the more it counts 
against them, it just shows what assholes they are.  If they left some blank,
it shows that they are willing to admit that they don't know something.
    Then I look at the felonious activities that they claim to be involved 
in.  I see if they know what they are talking about.  I have more respect for
a CyperCriminal.  I dunno, I just thinks it shows that they are smart enough 
to do it, and not get caught.
    Next I look at the groups they claim to be affiliated with.  I try to 
find some info on this group somewhere, like what they do, how large they, 
are, etc. I almost always delete people that are stupid, and put things like
'Fox Kids Club' --- Thats just stupid.
    I then look at what they want from the board.  If they want warez or 
games, it doesn't count against them, but I do mail them informing them 
that I don't have anything like that.  If they have nothing to offer, odds 
are they will be on a ratio of some sort.
    Then I look at the validation.  I just look at it, and see what they have 
to say.  Sometimes, some people just come off cool, and I will raise there Sl 
for it. 
    The last thing I do is to see if I can remember the user slamming the 
board in the past.  Hypocrites suck so I delete them.
