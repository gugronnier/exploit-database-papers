                             Sexism and Racism
                             -----------------

        Sexism and racism have dominated too much of the television news,
and have taken the last of my patience to visit my last nerve in the 
hospital.  Michael Chrichton has taken some bounds to challenge the 
boundaries of sexism (Disclosure -- a book about sexual harrasment), but
no one has enough balls to challenge racism.  It is the most delicate
subject that the great United States has been challenged with.  Take the
Rodney King case.  The black guys in Los Angeles didn't like the final
verdict -- thought it was racist -- and started riots costing billions
of dollars to finally fix.  Is the United States in such a twisted mode
so that if we don't like something, we kill and main other things/people?
I don't want my children to be in that type of atmosphere, and I'm sure
there are thousands of other people who can agree on that point--white 
or black or red or yellow or purple or green, male or female.

        First off, if you are offended by visual speaking, and are easily
offended, stop reading this, and delete the file.  I will be using the 
most powerful speaking I am capable of to get my point across.  Many 
people will get offended by this, but I hope you are capable of opening 
your mind enough to not have a fucking hemmorage.

        I'll start with sexism, since it is a delicate subject, and I want
to leave the biggest of my bitching for the racism part.  Women are 
bitches once they get power.  Men are bitches when they get power.  The
only difference between men and women is that men have had power for a 
long time, and women are just recently gaining power.  When I speak of 
power, I am speaking of corporate power--job power.  When a woman finally
gets a job that is "above" a man, the woman gets greedy.  The man has the
same problem.  We as a human race like sex.  Plain.  Simple.  Find me a
person who does not like sex, and I will show you a moron.  The person 
who doesn't like sex is weird.  Weird in a bad way.  Sex is a simple part
of human life--the whole race would stop if we all stopped having sex.  
"God" made us complex enough to "better" ourselves, to make it easier and
better for our children.  Now, back to sexism.  Women have more power then
men do right now.  Don't let any women tell you otherwise.  They do. Find
me a woman that can't get a job.  The woman either is a) stupid or b)
incapable of walking.  The woman can walk into a room where a job is 
being offered, and compete with a man for the job, and the woman will get 
it.  Plain and simple.  The reason is deeply rooted in MANkinds' loins. 
The boss would rather stare at a women all day for the next few years 
than a man.  
        Studies have shown that women are less reliable then men.   There
is proof of this.   Many bosses would rather have a man, because the 
woman has children, and has to take many months or years off to take care
of the child.  Women are using this in civil-right suits to try to gain 
the upper edge, and the jury will always go for the women, because now
a days, it is politically correct.  I'm sick of political correctness, 
but if it hasn't been discussed in a previous F.U.C.K., I will be sure
to make one in the near future.  It distorts humans reality to judge 
between right and wrong.  
        Sexual harrassment is a big part of sexism in the 90s.  The 
reason is that women are power hungry right now, because men let up
for just a few moments so that they could taste power, and they longed
for it like a vampire and human blood.  The women are saying that the 
male bosses are using sexual favors against the women.  No shit.  The
few women in power are doing the same thing to men, but men don't do
anything about it because of a few reasons.  20 years ago, a man could
walk down the street, walk by a beautiful woman, and yell to her "Hey
toots!  Nice tits!" and the women would be flattered.   Now, if you did
that, you'd get your face beat in by suits and you'd have no money left
after 10 minutes.  That's one way politcal correctness has distorted 
reality. Tell me, if you are a man, would you be flattered if a women 
walked by you and yelled back "Hey hunk!  Nice dick!"?  Yes, I should 
hope you would be.  Chances are, if a women said that to me, I'd go get 
her number.  I would in no way be offended, and if I was a woman, I don't
think I'd be offended by a man complimenting my tits.  I wouldn't have
a problem with that.   
        I don't think that this whole sexism and sexual harrassment 
issue has anything to do with men or women.  It has something to do with
power.  Once a woman gets some power, she will abuse it.  Keep women out
of power (why don't you think there haven't been any women presidents?  I
won't lie, I think it's because we all know that the woman has problems
with reality.)  Once a man gets some power, he will abuse it.  Keep men
out of power.  Wait a minute--that doesn't leave anyone in power.........

        I will start by saying that I am a white male.  I will add to this 
by saying I am not racist.  I have no problems with black people.  I have 
no problems with white people. I have no problems with hispanic people.  
I have no problems with asians.  There.
        As I said at the very beginning, power corrupts, and I think that
is the basis for all racism and sexism.  Black people, as a whole, had
no power in the 1700s, 1800s and the early 1900s.  That's just how it 
worked out, them being from Africa and we shipping them in to America. 
The past is not in debate now.  Now is in debate now.  Ask your average
black guy from anywhere.  Ask him if he thinks that blacks should be
compensated for all the wrongs that were commited to them by the whites
(and I will be the first to admit that they WERE wrongs.  They were
horrible things we did to black people.  Again, let me remind you that
that was then, this is now, compare the differences).  They will 
undoubtally say yes.  The black people think that we should compensate
to them by giving them all of our jobs.  Switching places with them, et 
cetera.  I have a problem with that.
        I know of a lot of black people who have gotten good well-paying
jobs.  You want to know how they accomplished this?  They worked hard,
and eventually broke through just like any other white guy who made it
big, and made money.   I hear from people at my school that they think
that there is no way to make it in the world if you are black. You have
to be white.  This is in no way true.  If you would just get your mouth
off your crack pipe long enough to listen to what you say, you'd also
understand.  Bill Cosby is a great example of a black guy who made it
VERY big.  TV series.  Movies.  Stand-up comedy.  This guy worked his
ass off to get where he is today.  I can bet that he never once said 
"I'm black, I don't think I'll be able to make it."  I bet he did 
nothing but "I am a good actor/comedian/writer.  I will make it."  
The attitude of black people needs to change, and that statement is
not racist.  
        Black people have too much power.  I remember when the black 
female was the person who was the worst off (sexism & racism both against
her).  The white male used to be the best off (sexism & racism both in
his favor).  Now, she has the most power and he is at the bottom.  If
a black women goes into a job and is competing against a white male, she
will get the job -- almost always.  This is because the bos wants to stay
in business.  If she doesn't get it, if she's not completly stupid, she
will sue the boss for racism.  She will win too.  Hands down.  Another
thing about political correctness.  Think about that.
        Lets talk about power with black people.  Go back a few years
to the Rodney King case.  This guy gets pulled over for something, and
the white (remember, they are WHITE!%!@  OH NO!) police officers come
to his car, ask him to get out, and throroughly beat him.  Some other
guy is sitting offstage to video-tape the whole incident (Hey, if you
ever see my getting my ass beat by some cops, please at least call
some more cops over, or something [or help me!@$%]).  Now, Rodney
gets to sue these cops, and the first verdict isn't in his favor. Los
Angeles black people don't like this.  So, what do they do?  They cause
billions of dollars worth of damage to Los Angeles, because some drunk
coke-sniffing black guy gets his ass whooped.  This shows how much
political correctness has an influence on the judicial system.  The 
jury doesn't really have to be there anymore.  You are guilty before
you go in the courtroom if you're a white male.  Strange, but true.

        This completes my issue on racism and sexism.  Please, again, 
if you are insulted or offended by this article, I don't really care.  
If your mind is so dilluted from polical correctness, tough shit, that
is your problem.  I don't want to hear from you on how horrible I am.

        I only speak what I see.
