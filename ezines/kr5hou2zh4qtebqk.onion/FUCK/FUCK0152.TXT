			     Capitalistic Slavery
			     --------------------

		Work, whether you are a bagboy in a grocery store or
the CEO of a heavy hitting company, enslaves us the grind of capitalism
and what it does for our government.  By the time you prepare for work,
go to work, and spend time winding down from work, you have spent a good 
portion of your day bringing in the bacon.  The emotional price is
incalculable.  Why do we work?  What does it do for us?  Better yet,
what does it do for our governemt?

	Well, most of you will say that you work to buy nice things and
take care of the necessities of life.  But what does your hard
work *really* do?  What price are you paying to get that preprinted
slip of paper with a dollar amount made out to you?  Sure, a paycheck
buys your food, your clothes, your shelter, and miscellaneous
materialistic goods.  And when you get your check, it is doesn't reflect
the number of hours you worked in its monetary value, because the
government has already removed a portion of it for its use.  And when 
you buy your food, your clothes, your shelter, and your extras, what do
you do again?  You give *another* portion of your hard earned money to
the government.

	So what, you say, everyone has to do it.  But think about it.  What
did the government do to earn that money?  What are they doing with it?
Do they really give it back in the form of public services?  Do they
use it to protect you?  No.  They spend it on committee after committee,
C-SPAN television appreances, hike up our debt, make you pay more
taxes, and forget about health insurance or subsizing your income.  You
only get those services if you don't work.  All of this in the name 
of our great democracy and its capitalistic industry.  The government will
subsidize your college expenses, not to give you an education, but to
help you get a higher paying job.  With a higher paying job you pay
more taxes and they make more money off of you.  With a high paying
job you buy a bigger house on nicer property, high dollar items that
bring in more tax money, and *still* get screwed by the IRS in April.

	I say that this is a sophisticated form of propaganda and slavery.
You grow up hearing all about our great country and climbing up the
corporate and financial ladder to live rich full lives.  Work hard,
enjoy life less, prosper financially, and die young.  In the process of
doing all this, give your hard earned money to a bloated, inefficient
government that chips away at our proverbial block of rights quietly
every year.  The American governemt wants rich Americans to pad their
pockets and increase their power over other countries and its own citizens.
After all, the average number of hours worked by each American every year
is only slightly less than our Japanese friends, who are famous for
their work ethic.  As a result, our emotional and physical health is
poor as compared to other First World countries, but hey, we're one of
the richest, and that's all that counts, right?

	Wrong.  We are suffering.  There is no more freedom.  We are chained
to our desks in fear.  We have no time to enjoy life, take care of
ourselves physically or emotionally.  We are money producing, poorly 
treated, ignored by our government, slaves.  I say we all move to France,
the land of two hour lunches, an average of two months of vacation time
each year, and free health care to all.  We would live longer, enjoy
life more, and make just a little less money.  I'm game, are you?
