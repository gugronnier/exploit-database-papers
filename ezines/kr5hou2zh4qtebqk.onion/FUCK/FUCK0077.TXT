                                Today
                                -----

        As each day passes, the future grows dimmer. If you catch
the news, hear radio talk shows, read the paper, you will always
hear about a multitude of bad events that plagued the day. Almost
everytime you hear of some tragic event, you hear of some new
legislation or some new science that will make events like that
less frequent, or more bearable, or something positive. Who are
we kidding though? Two years ago the violence was thought to be
intolerable. More and more murders were being committed, more
prisons were overcrowding, more violent crimes were happening,
and overall, people were saying how it would get better because
of tougher laws, better living conditions. Look around today.
Same thing just a different date. More murders, more gun wielding
kids, more overcrowding, more poverty, and like usual, more positive
notions of things to come.

        Today, I can walk out my front door, drive a ways, and
purchase a gun. A 9mm will do, doesn't really matter what kind
of gun it is. From there, I walk to a place with a good amount
of people, but kind of secluded. I break out the gun, and shoot
four or five people. After that, I rape a woman, then kill her.
I walk into a nearby store, commit armed robbery, then walk out
and open fire on a few more people. I then drop my gun, sit on
the sidewalk, and put my hands on my head. After the police arrest
me for all the crimes that I will plead innocent to, I will begin
my first trial a year or so later. One year in a county jail, 
eating three square meals, having a roof over my head, and relaxing
with more free time than I have ever had. Three months after that,
I am convicted of first degree murder on the first of my victims.
I am sentenced to life in prison with no possibility of parole.
A month after that I go to trial again, not appealing the first trial
but instead, getting tried for the second of the murders. Another
trial after that for the third, and so on. Probably after the second
or so year, I will go to trial for the rape crime, then the armed
robbery, and a few more murder charges. Doesn't matter that I was
sentenced to life without parole years back, but under new law, I am
to be tried for each of my crimes, even if a lesser crime, even if
I have already been convicted. Now, on top of the 25,000 dollars you
tax payers are dishing out to keep me fed for a year, you are paying
hundreds of thousands of dollars for my trials, my public defender,
my transportation to and from the court, and every other expense that
I cause.

        Today I belong to Generation X. What is GX? That means I am
imbetween the ages of 18 and 29. I am the generation after the Baby
Boomers, and the generation before the unnamed generation running
our streets right now. I am considered to be a member of the highest
educated generation in America. Like many other members of GX, I blame
the Baby Boomers for the hellish world I am forced to survive in.
If I get a bachelor's degree, I am no longer guaranteed a job when
I graduate. If I get a PHD, or a Master's, I face the potential of
entering the job market 'Over Qualified'. If I blame the generation
before me I must hear something to the effect of "It was tough for us
to survive and make a living, no reason it shouldn't be for you too."
Throughout my education I have been taught not to be prejudiced, not
to be biased, and not to _stereotype_. Yet I belong to Generation X.

        Today, I must worry about everyone near me, no matter what
they look like, or who they are. I know that at any time, my best friend,
or a customer in the store I work at could pull a gun, and kill me.
Urban violence no longer plagues the poor communities. Two days ago
a man pulled a gun from his jacket enough to show the salesman and 
cashier that he was carrying, then proceeded to tell them "I am walking
out of here with this notebook'. Indeed he did, he now owns a top of the
line notebook computer. When I drive home, I must be careful not to make
eye contact with anyone else around me. If I do, it might be interpreted
as 'staring', and I must be punished. I can not yell at anyone for driving
poorly near me. If I honk or give someone the finger, I am liable to 
wind up dead, just another statistic for the newspapers that will tell
me things are getting better.

        Today, maybe that newspaper is right. I am no longer here on
this planet.
