                                Privacy
                                -------

        What is privacy? Nothing. Absolutely nothing. The notion that you
have any sort of privacy is ludicrous. Don't think for one second that
you do. If you do this, you won't be surprised when you learn that simple
fact.

        Why do I bring this up? Just a friendly warning to you so that you
can prepare for this little thing and make any arrangements you think
would help. First off, I am just an ordinary guy, no special powers, no
special ability to invade privacy really. But, since I am a little more
technically inclined than the average citizen, I could be your worst
nightmare.
        Sitting here on my balcony right now, I am capable of invading
thousands of people's privacy in a matter of seconds. My laptop has a
POCSAG decoder attached through the serial port as well as a radio shack
scanner. Every few seconds I get anywhere up to thirty pages across my
screen. In most cases I am getting the numeric numbers, but occasionally
I can read full alphanumeric pages. If I am so inclined, I could use my
cell phone to call any one of these people back and tell them exactly
what they paged, the capcode of the pager that received it, the time the
paging network sent out the page, and more.
        Next to my laptop is another Realistic scanner that is monitoring
all cordless phone traffic in my entire neighborhood. Everything from
plans during the week, to soap opera gossip, to a little talk about sex
is caught by the scanner. If I was really bored, I could interrupt their
conversation and tell them what I thought. Next to that is another Realistic
scanner monitoring all cellular traffic within miles of here. Cellular
conversation tends to be a little more interesting as people are more
concise and to the point.
        The three cell phones lying on the edge of the balcony each
allow us to call anywhere we want, absolutely free. Every once in a while
we will hook them up to the computer and reprogram the NAM info. The
NAM info is what the cell company uses to identify your phone. Also on the
edge of the balcony is a set of binoculars in case there is any movement
in any of the windows nearby.
        Just a few feet from our building is a small telco box containing
the lines of all the land lines in the area. Anyone picking up their home
phone to make a call, I could listen if I wanted. All it would take is
my lineman's handset and a few minutes. If a neighbor just happens to
have a radio of any sort, that would be picked up with one of the scanners.

        So, if you are using a ground line, cordless phone, cell phone,
pager, or radio, I can listen. If you have your blinds open, I can see
you. If I want more info, I can use almost any of the above info in one
way or another to get the rest of your information.

        If we go a step beyond, and use government level equipment, we
can do quite a bit more. With a laser based microphone listening device,
I can sit half a mile from your house, and bounce this laser against your
window which would let me listen to everything you say. With a few thousand
dollars I can get a scope that allows me to see through your walls. A
few more thousand and I add a VanEck device and monitor anything that
crosses your computer monitor, everything you type into your keyboard.
If I go high enough, I can even read the contents of your RAM.. from
several yards away.
        On the other side of the game, you have less and less measures
available to ensure your privacy. Beyond that are technologies that I
can only start to imagine about. Radical new methods of surveillance
allowing better and more accurate monitoring of more people. They are
out there.. trust me.
