                        The Years of Glass
                        ------------------

        The light begins to fade away,
        as I stand up and you turn to look the other way.
        I bring my hand up, pressing it up against the glass,
        though you cannot see me, nor hear my heart beating.

        Here I am, watching you, waiting for you,
        wanting and wishing you were me, or I were you.

        Then enters the one that placed this huge weight
        upon my head.  Wanting it bronzed, and such ...
        I trace his face, with my fingertips, over the glass,
        I wish he could have heard my cry.

        Ones believe what they wish to,
        even if they know the truth is different then the supposed fact.

        Seeing you, I wonder if you ever think,
        or do you just go and do?
        What was it I said to you?
        What was it that I did so badly?

        Only the truth can set you free,
        and only the strength of trust has trapped me here.
        You could have helped me break free, though you did not want to...
        for that would mean, that I am me, and you are you,
        us being on different sides, while together could never be.
        So, here I am, where you have trapped me.

        Breaking free, will I ever make it?
        How can you just stand there, laughing
        as I stand here with tears that long ago ran dry.
        For, even I do not cry anymore.
        What good does an angel do,
        if you are trapped beneath the hell that you've been through?
