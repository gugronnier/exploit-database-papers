        Recently, there has been a lot of news coverage on banning things,
and censorship of others. Ranging from books, to gifs on the computers, to
IRC on internet. The list of items that are wanted banned grows daily and
never does it diminish. About once a month, I UL a file I get from somewhere
that is a list of things that have been banned here or there. After I read
them, I really have to question what the fuck is going on through people's
minds.
        The one that got me the other day is this. Someone at a college
in Iowa or something like that, wants all IRC use banned at that college.
For those of you who don't know what IRC is, it is 'Internet Relay Chat', 
although some people say it stands for something else. Either way, it is
just that, chatting. Basically, there are anywhere from 1000 to 3000 
people on at any given time. There are usually hundreds of channels
you can join. All you do is '/JOIN #<channel>' and that puts you on a 
semi-private channel depending. Channels can be 100% private, secret, invite
only, open to everyone who is on IRC, etc. It all depends. Anyway, you 
get on a channel, or start one on your own. Other people may or may not 
be on the channel but usually there is. I frequent many channels and 
on the average there is about 8 or so people on. Sometimes more, sometimes 
less. Anyway, so you and the other people can chat. If you just type 
something, everyone sees it. You read what everyone else is saying also. 
You can also privately send a message to whoever you want so only you 
two read it. Either way, all you do is chat. The cool part is, on some 
channels I have been on, I simultaneously chat with someone from New York, 
Canada, Europe, Australia, and other countries. We don't know each other 
of course but we all have common interests and can talk about them. There 
is basically a channel for any topic you could imagine, and if there isn't, 
then you can make one. What harm is there chatting with people around the 
world? That is all it is, yet people at this one college want it banned. 
That is complete bullshit.
        Next, we have books. It seems that at every library, there is always
a book or two that has been banned for some reason. Most are banned because
of offensive language. A bad word here, or a bad word there, and some
bible thumpin bitch wants it banned. Who cares if the book tells about real
life, moral situations, etc. Some are banned because of content. Maybe 
graphical sexual descriptions or something, I don't know. One 'ban' recently
caught my attention. You have seen the "where's waldo" books and posters no
doubt. Ok. In on book of those pictures, on one page, in the upper left
hand corner, is a small female who is standing up after water is poured on
her back. She is not wearing a bikini top and her breasts are showing. The 
thing is, the whole female shown like that, is no bigger than this 
character: O . And the book was banned by some uppity bitch because her son
pointed it out. Excuse me, but isn't that a little ridiculous? 
        People like that are a fucking menace to society. It is the close 
minded thinking like that that causes so many problems. If some kid grows 
up thinking it is bad to see a breast in a cartoon, what happens when they 
get their hands on some porn flick when they are 15 years old? They think 
that it is one of the coolest things that has ever been done, then they 
show it to their friends, and they make a bigger deal of it. These same 
kids grow up with a fundamental lacking of understanding 'birds and bees'. 
From there, they know little about sex, and from there little about the 
problems that are associated with sex, such as AIDS, diseases, and 
pregnancy. It all leads to something else at one point or another.
        They already censor television too much. It has been proven countless
times that if kids are exposed to 'obscene' or 'violent' things in a 
semi-controlled environment, then they grow up with a better understanding
of that subject, and less problems arise from it. If it is common day things,
then kids don't think anything of it. 
        Another thing that bothers the hell out of me, is BBSs around here,
and other places. These files, the F.U.C.K. files, have been banned of a few
local boards for various reasons. Usually the name alone does it. People
don't have the fucking insight to read what is uploaded to them. So they
think it is some cheezy XXX text file. Either way, they are banned, therefore
censoring what I and others say, even though these files will improve other 
people if they read them. Many BBSs will censor posts and messages by 
saying the board rules include no cussing. Other sysops, outright delete
posts with an offensive word. Excuse me, but isn't one of the ideas of a
BBS to be able to express yourself, and share your ideas with others? 
        What is a word? Fuck. To me, is slang for having sex. It means
nothing further. If someone says fuck you, it means exactly that. If someone
says shit, then it is human feces. If someone says damn, then it means 
curse. Damn it, means curse it. Nothing more. So what makes these words 
offensive, and not the words, crap, curse, and fornication? They mean the
same thing. The only difference, is they hype behind each word. Kids grow
up these days learning that those words are bad, and mean vile things, and
that corrupts their minds far more in the long run.
        Although those are only two examples above, look at what it shows
you is getting banned. If people can get away with banning shit like that,
then what is next? Free speech is losing its meaning so fast and you really
have to question whether it is too late to stop it. More and more items
are banned for one reason or another, and nothing ever gets off the ban
list it seems, and if it does, you don't know about it and therefore don't
look for it.
        All I can ask is this. If something in your area is about to be
banned, then make a copy of it. Spread the news around, and let everyone,
not just one misguided person decide if it should be banned or not. Don't
let a small group control part of your surroundings like that.
