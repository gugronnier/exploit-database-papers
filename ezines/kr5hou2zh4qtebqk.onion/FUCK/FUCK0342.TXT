                        "No Hablo Espanol"
                        ------------------

Again, someone is speaking to me in Spanish. Staring at her face, I repeat 
"What?" hoping she will either realize I don't understand Spanish and try 
to speak in English, or just give up. After three or four sentences, she 
asks me "No Espanol?" and as usual, I say "No," while shouting "YOU LEARN 
HOW TO SPEAK ENGLISH YOU LAZY BITCH!" in my head.

I am not saying that English is superior to any other language, and I 
don't believe in "Do as the Romans do." Note that I love Latin American 
food, and some people ARE fully bilingual. However, I believe that one 
needs to have knowledge of basic English if they live in the United 
States. After all, this country consists of various ethnic groups, and we 
cannot communicate with each other without a "standard" language.

Somehow, many of the Hispanic immigrants in Miami do not even try to learn 
English. They often make excuses that they don't have money to go to 
school, they don't have time, they are too old to learn, and so on. Then, 
I may ask how I learned some Spanish phrases without taking any classes. 
TV or radio programs should be sufficient if one is really willing to 
learn. There are free English courses offered on weekends, which my 
parents have taken, if one wants to improve his/her conversation skills.

Believe it or not, my college even provides Spanish-speakers special 
"bilingual" programs. Some core courses are taught both in English and 
Spanish. Then, I ask myself, why there is no classes taught in Japanese. 
This upsets me since I suffered so much learning English when I came to 
this country four years ago. If Spanish-speakers can pass the class 
easily, then all the other International students should be treated the 
same way (though I am glad I didn't have such an option since I could 
learn English so much faster).

They do not learn English simply because the majority of the society (at 
least in Miami) speak Spanish. Provided that the local governments are run 
by Spanish-speakers (mostly Cuban-Americans), they often act as though 
their culture is the best, and that everyone else should follow their 
rules. They seem to forget that it all started to conserve their 
ethnicity, not to dominate the society. They should be criticized as well 
as Americans who know nothing but English (hey, it should be so much 
easier for you to learn Spanish than for me to learn English!).

So I might start learning Spanish if they, at least, TRY to speak English 
to me, without making a stupid assumption that I am a Japanese-Peruvian 
who understands Spanish. Maybe I should talk back to them in Japanese next 
time. Or perhaps I should move out of Miami as soon as I finish my school. 
But I'm kind of attached to the taste of Cafe con Leche. Well, you never 
know, I might miss the sound of "Spanglish" if I leave here.
