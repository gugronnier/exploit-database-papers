                              StereoTyping
                              ------------

     Since stereotyping is such a big topic now a days with gender appearance
and attitude, I felt the need to rant and rave about it.  The biggest comment
I get as a practicing Satanist is, "You don't look like a Satanist.." At
first I was amused by this, but now I am annoyed.  I know that we all have
this impression that Satanist are mean looking people that wear all black
all the time and talk in morbid tones.  Well, I am not that type of person
and I really don't think that I need to change my apperance to fit the role.
The same goes for the other side, when most people think of Christians they
think of clean cut and never us fowl language.  I knew a man that never cut
his hair and wore rags most of the time, yet he was a devout Christian.

     I think that it is human nature to stereotype.  People today act as
if it is one of the greatest injustices in the world.  In my psychology 102
class they were fighting about the differences in men and women.  The women
saying how men are insensitive and an affectionate, and the men claiming that
the women are over zealous in there attempts at a relationship.  This is all
caused by stereotyping.  The main reason that we stereotype is that our
brains are attempting to organize chaos, that is why we have dispositions or
feelings about people that we have never met.  We register them and then
compare them to past experiences.  I think that people that deny that they
do this are lying to themselves.  When you see somebody, anybody, walking
down a street you are going to stereotype them and then have a preconceived
notion about them as a person.

     I know that when I see somebody in baggy clothes and a team jersey on
I automatically think "wannabe gang-banger" when in fact they might be
some kid that is attempting to imitate some rapper.  I just recently
had an experience that kind of changed my view of blacks for instance.  I
am now working closely with a black man, he is intelligent and doesn't talk
in ebonics <or whatever>.  We sat down after work and he told me that a lot
of his family and friends claim him to be 'white' because he doesn't
communicate in slang.  He said that he use to use slang to fit in, but
learned propper English to be able to communicate with society as a whole.
I found great respect for him because it was almost like he was getting it
on both sides. This one man changed my stereotype of blacks in general.  So
it isn't like stereotypes are set in stone and that you will never ever
change your mind.  That is why I feel they are so overrated by people.

     I think that people that complain the most about stereotyping are
usually the ones that do it the most themselves.  So in essence I wrote
this to say that stereotyping isn't the greatest thing hurting humanity
and that most if not all of us at one time will break the stereotyping
we have of certain sects of people.
