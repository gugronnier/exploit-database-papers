                                We Pay, They Die
                                ----------------

Do you ever watch those horrid specials on late night TV that show
the little children in Africa with the swollen stomachs that show
they are suffering from starvation?

Did you ever send money to keep them from starving to death?  I'd bet
not. It's just the way life is.  It's not *your* fault they are
starving, is it?

Well, actually it *is* your fault -- if you are an American tax payer,
that is.  What's this you say?  The American government is paying to
starve children in Africa?  How barbaric!  But it's true.  Read on!

What causes children in Africa to starve?  Some sort of global food
shortage?  Not a chance.  Between 1950 and 1985 world grain production
grew from 725 million tons to 1.7 billion tons, far outstripping
population growth and contributing to an average 25 percent increase in
the amount of food available per person worldwide.  According to the
World Health Organization (WHO) per capita food intake increased from
less that 95% of the caloric minimum to sustain life to over 110% of
that number in the same time period.

Go to your local supermarket. Is there food there? What is keeping your
local supermarket chain from opening a store in Ethiopia?  It's not a
lack of food to fill a store in Ethiopia.  It's the fact that food is
expensive and the starving children have no hard currency.

Why is food expensive?  Let's look at one of the most basic and simple
laws of economics: supply and demand.  If the supply of food rises and
the demand stays the same, price goes down.  If the supply of food goes
down and the demand stays the same, price rises.  Here is a chart:

                  +--------+--------+-------+
                  | Supply | Demand | Price |
                  +--------+--------+-------+
                  | Up     | NC     | Down  |
                  +--------+--------+-------+
                  | Down   | NC     | Up    |
                  +--------+--------+-------+
                  | NC     | Up     | Up    |
                  +--------+--------+-------+
                  | NO     | Down   | Down  |
                  +--------+--------+-------+

How is the American government affecting this, you might be tempted to
ask? Our American government is paying well-fed aristocratic bums like
Sam Donaldson to *not* produce food.  That's right.  If you own a farm
in America, the government will pay you NOT to farm it.

Why does the government do this?  The government does it to keep food
prices high, ostensibly to support American farmers.  What is the real
effect?  Children in Africa with swollen stomachs.  Next time you see
Sam Donaldson smiling on TV, imagine that rich fucker with a distended
stomach.
