The following taken from The Course: The Journal of the Second American
Revolution.  I encourage you to read it.  If you need a copy or need
to know where you can get it, mail me.

Heavy-handed raids and abuses against law-abiding citizens, harassment of
gun dealers, and the illegal computerization of out-of-business FFL dealer
records are hallmarks of this rogue federal agency.


    Ask Harry and Theresa Lumplugh.  This past Summer, 15 to 20 armed men
burst into their rural Pennsylvania home.  The family cooperates -- opening
safes, handing over papers -- but cooperation doesn't ease the intruders'
wrath.  One holds a submachine gun in their faces.  Another utters a racial
slur.  One empties vial after vial of cancer medicine and crushes it on the
bathroom floor.  Another stomps a pet cat to death.

Who are these intruders?

    Ask 21-year old Monique Montgomery.  Four masked men break into her
bedroom at four in the morning.  The glaring lights and the timing of the
hit are meant to maximize Monique's disorientation as she wakes from a deep
sleep.  And wake she does, pulling a gun for self-defense, but the
intruders already have their guns drawn and let her have it -- four shots,
four direct hits.

Who are these intruders?

    Ask Louie Katona II of Ohio -- successful businessman, civic leader,
part-time cop, family man, model American.  One intruder pushes wife
Kimberly against a wall.  Kimberly begins bleeding and later miscarries.

Who are these armed terrorists?

    Not a gang of neighborhood toughs.  They're agents of the Bureau of
Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, and the incidents described above are not
exceptions, but recent examples of the brute force of unchecked, renegade
federal power.  Who are the victims?  People who've broken no law, in homes
where nothing illegal is found.

    The terror often comes at the hands of BATF agents clad in ninja
blacks, but the terror doesn't stop there.  Even the desk jockeys in the
licensing part of the agency get in their licks.

Bend to BATF's politics -- or get broken.

    BATF visits Randy Engelken, a gun-store owner in Seneca, Kansas, and
photocopies any transaction record involving the purchase of military-style
semi-automatic firearms.  Why just those firearms?  The agent comments on
Randy's political activism -- namely his vocal opposition to U.S. Rep. Jim
Slattery (defeated last fall).  In a style that would make the KGB proud,
the BATF agent tells Randy: "If you don't lay off Congressman Slattery, you
wont have a firearms license."

Surrender your license -- or surrender your reputation.

    BATF is committed to driving down the number of Federal Firearms
License (FFL) holders to drive down lawful gun ownership.  And they'll do
it any way they can.  A typical case: BATF raises the zoning issue by
contacting a Pennsylvania township directly, informing officials that a
resident with an FFL is conducting retail sales in the township.  BATF also
speaks directly with a supplier to the dealer, suggesting that the dealer
was lying about being a federal agent.  The agent also goes to the dealer's
supervisor, demeaning his reputation.  In fact, no crime was committed by
the dealer -- who was and remains a special agent with the U.S. Department
of Justice Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) -- a law
enforcement professional with 25 years experience.

They ban whatever they can -- whenever they can.

    Ignore the fine print in the '94 Clinton Gun Ban that some firearms are
"protected," because BATF ignores it.  Forget the fact that the 1860 Henry
lever-action was listed as protected, because, for months, BATF banned it's
importation -- considering the cowboy rifle an "assault weapon."

And now they've got your name -- and your number!

    On February 15, 1995, at a hearing of the House Appropriation
Subcommittee on Treasury, Postal Service and General Government, officials
of the Treasury Department and BATF admitted that all the records of
firearms transactions between U.S. citizens and out-of-business dealers are
being entered into a centralized registration system under the control of
BATF.  Throughout history, registration has always been a precursor to
harassment, a stepping stone to gun confiscation.  Recognizing this, the
U.S. Congress has spoken clearly and distinctly over the last three
decades: no money, no people and no administrative expenses can ever be
used to register firearms, firearms owners or firearm transactions.
Period.

    But BATF is not listening.  They're copying, collating and
computerizing (see Knox's Notebook, P14) -- while their agents in the field
are harassing, intimidating and hurting honest citizens.

    It must stop -- and it can!  Call your U.S. representative and U.S.
senators at (202)224-3121, and do it now.  Tell them it's time to either
abolish this rogue agency -- or take immediate steps to (1) regain control,
(2) expose and prosecute government agents and officials guilty of civil
rights abuses and (3) institute strict policies and oversight to insure
that the Bill of Rights is honored, not condemned.

SINA BRUSH
     Just after dawn on September 5, 1991 some sixty agents
from the DEA, U.S. Forest Service, Bureau of Alcohol,
Tobacco and Firearms (BATF), and National Guard, complete
with painted faces and camouflage and accompanied by another
twenty or more National Guard troops with a light armored
vehicle, raided the homes of Sina Brush and two of her
neighbors near Montainair, New Mexico. Brush and her
daughter were still asleep.  Hearing noises outside, Ms.
Brush got up and was only halfway across the room, when the
door was kicked in by the agents.  Clad only in their
underwear, Ms. Brush and her daughter were handcuffed and
forced to kneel in the middle of the room while the agents
searched the house.  No drugs were found.  Just as in the
Carlson case, the police had obtained a warrant using
information furnished by an unreliable informant and had
entered Brush's home without knocking first.

WACO
     This most notorious case has stunned the sensibilities
of millions of Americans.  According to The Wall Street
Journal, "...the BATF showed up at the Davidian compound
with two cattle trucks full of agents in battle gear and a
plan for 'dynamic entry'."  The siege that followed the
initial assault included terrifying, psychological warfare
tactics and ended when a second attack, utilizing tanks and
gas, led to conflagration. "Weird cultists"  (your words)?
Some of the adults, but certainly not the children.

For two years now, thousands of calls and letters of outrage
have been received by government, the media and yes, the
NRA.  The cries of "thugs",  "Nazi" and "storm trooper" came
first, not from the NRA, but from the minds and mouths of
Americans describing what they had seen on television.

RANDY WEAVER
     This debacle at Ruby Ridge continues to fan a seething
backlash in the country.  A fourteen year old boy was shot
in the back and killed.  A mother was shot by a sniper in
the head and killed while holding a baby.  A jury found BATF
guilty of entrapment and the defendant was acquitted.  How
does it all add up to justifiable behavior by, once again,
black shrouded forces with armored personnel carriers,
helicopters and snipers all arrayed against a family in a
cabin?  Hundreds of good people have told me that scene
reminds them of what this country once fought against and
should never stand for.

JANICE HART
PORTLAND, OREGON
FEBRUARY  1993
     Janice Hart pulled up to her house from grocery
shopping with her daughters to find her house being
ransacked by ATF agents who had kicked in the door.  Agents
searched her home, throwing dishes, pulling clothing from
hangers and emptying drawers on the floor (she photographed
the damage).  Some eight ATF agents interrogated her in the
basement for an hour before reading her rights.  She
asked to call an attorney and the agents refused.  When they
finally asked her if she was Janice Marie Harrell, she told
them no, that she was Janice Hart.  ATF agents mocked her,
accused her of selling firearms and cocaine, then arrested
her.  The Portland Police, who she commended for their
professional demeanor, took her downtown for booking and,
within thirty seconds of fingerprinting her, realized ATF
had the wrong person.

LOUIS KATONA
BUCYRUS, OHIO
     Louis Katona is a police officer in Bucyrus, Ohio.
When shouting and cursing BATF agents rushed into his home
to seize his firearms collection, they grabbed his pregnant
wife, Kim, and shoved her into a wall.  Within days, she
suffered a miscarriage. A federal judge threw the
government's case out of court and ordered BATF to
immediately return Mr. Katona's guns or face jail
themselves.  The Katonas are presently pressing civil
charges against BATF.


The above incidents are true.  For more information, read The Course.

All of the following stories and much more can be found in the July, 1993,
issue of _The Freeman_.


1) In 1990 in California, dozens of legitimate agricultural supply
houses and mail order businesses were seized because the DEA claimed they
might have unwittingly sold supplies to marijuana growers.  Both the 
DEA and California courts considered the merchants' lack of control over
how their grow lights and fertilizer might be used to be irrelevant.

2) In December, 1988, Detroit police raided a grocery store to make a
drug arrest, but failed to find any drugs.  After police dogs 
reacted to three $1 bills in the cash register, the police seized the entire
contents of the cash register and a store safe totaling $4,384.  No charge 
was ever made.

3) In 1989, police stopped 49 year-old Ethel Hylton at the Houston
airport and told her she was under arrest because a drug dog had
scratched at her luggage.  Agents searched her bags and strip-searched
her, but they found no drugs.  They did find $39,110 in cash that she
had received from an insurance settlement and from her life savings.
Ethyl Hilton completely documented where she got the money and was
never charged with a crime.  The police kept her money anyway.  As
far as I know, she still hasn't gotten it back.

4) Willie Jones owned a small landscaping business in Nashville.  
When he paid cash for an airline ticket, the ticket agent acted strangely.
Ten minutes later, drug agents stopped and searched him.  They found 
$9,600 in cash, which he was planning to use to buy plants for his business.
He explained that he paid in cash because that was the way the growers
wanted it.  That didn't stop the agents from taking his money.  
Willie Jones was never charged with any crime.

5) Dr. Jonathan Wright operated the Takoma Medical Clinic in Kent,
Washington.  On May 6, 1992, two dozen armed FDA agents broke
down the door and held the 15-person staff, mostly women, at
gunpoint for 14 hours while they ransacked the clinic. The FDA
seized Dr. Wright's books, laboratory equipment, supplies, patient
records, reference books, and computers.  The raid was part of the
FDA's crackdown on nutritional therapists.  No one was charged with
a crime.

6) In 1992, heavily armed men burst into a house in Oakdale, CA, and
pinned 64-year-old retired ranch foreman William Hauselmann to the
floor, bruising his back and cutting his face.  They also held his 
61-year-old wife at gunpoint on the bathroom floor while they ransacked
the house. They were acting on a tip that they admitted "proved to be 
180 degrees wrong."

7) On August 25, 1992, the US Customs Service and DEA raided the
house of Donald Carlson.  Without announcing who they were, they
began battering down the door.  Carlson awoke and thought he was
being robbed, so he armed himself.  The agents smashed down the door
and lobbed a concussion grenade.  There was an exchange of fire,
Carson was hit 3 times, and he spent six weeks hooked to a ventilator
in intensive care.  The agents found no drugs.  They had been acting 
on a tip from an informant known only as "Ron" who had been kicked out
of an anti-drug program because his reports lacked truthfulness.

8) On October 2, 1992, a drug task force composed of LA police,
sheriff's deputies, DEA, National Park personnel, and National Guard troops 
burst into the home of Donald Scott and shot him dead.  The agents said 
they were looking for marijuana, but found none.  The following March 30, 
the Ventura County District Attorney released a report disclosing that 
the real reason for the raid was because the government wanted Scott's
200-acre ranch as part of its expansion plans for the Santa Monica
National Recreation Area.  Scott had refused to sell, so they made
him an offer he couldn't refuse.  The ranch was seized under federal
forfeiture laws.

Its time for change in this country.  For those that believe the government
controls the agencies under it, think again.  Rogue agencies do exist.
MIBs (Men in Black) do exist.  No one truly holds their leash.
