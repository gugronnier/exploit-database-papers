                                Daily Rot
                                ---------

Here I am on a random day with random thoughts, and I've realized one 
thing, the thing that strings us all together the people that read this, 
all of us disfunctional irc-er's, the hax0rs.. we all have a curse, the 
curse of curiosity. We don't except the "truth" as it is told to us. We 
question anything and everything. I have also noticed that for the most 
part have had a fucked up/ non-existant childhood. The "cyber" culture 
not only brings us together, but separates us from reality, and from 
ourselves.

We run home everyday (those of us who leave the house) to a blinking 
screen, talking to people all over the world, arguing over imaginary 
boundaries (all you people who play irk war games know who you are) It 
gives a sense of who we are, or rather what we want people to see. We can 
be tough, we can stand up to the fears that have kept us in our remote 
existence. We can be distant yet at the same time so much closer to 
people that don't exist in our "daily routines"

We are the kids that didn't have a voice, but now can bellow and be heard, 
we are the ones that don't put up with beurocratic bullshit, we question 
it and put up a fight, if not a physically, we don't let ourselves submit 
mentally. The net like anything else has been taking over by the 
"industry" every time I hit a web page some advertisement comes up (and 
that's why i don't watch T.V.) or get some junk email promising a "get 
rich quick scheme" .. I get nauseus, I feel like it's being taken over. 
Our safe haven, where you don't have to be a certain color, or "type" to 
fit in, is once again going to be controlled by mindless fucks who only 
care about making money. Information is why we are all here why, stirred 
by our curiosity we spent many sleepless  nights filling our hunger. 

You can dismiss this as some random rambling written by a random person 
on a random day.. or you can take some time and think about what i have 
said, why we are here why we are reading this.. information == knowledge. 
And that is what we strive for what we hope to achieve, not status , or 
money but the right to think freely and speak freely. So when you stare 
blankly at your screen remember what brought you there in the first place..
