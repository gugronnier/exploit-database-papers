                    Macintosh: God's Gift to Microwaves
                    -----------------------------------

        I was watching T.V, trying to dodge all of the infomercials
that they show at late hours of the night, when I saw the most
ridiculous and misleading piece of advertising that anyone can be
subjected to.  The commercial was one half hour long, dedicated
to Macintosh, a paid advertisement from Apple, Inc.  Not only was the
premise of the advertisement disgustingly sweet and family-oriented, it
also happened to be a string of lies.  The following is a compilation
of just a few examples cited in the commercial:
_____________________________________________________________________________
                                           
    APPLE MYTH #1:  You must know actual (GASP!) commands in order to
                    operate an IBM-compatible PC.

    REALITY CHECK:  Since most PC's now come loaded with Windows95 or
                    WindowsNT, CLIs (Command Line Interfaces) have pretty
                    much been reduced to mousing around.  Die-hards use
                    DOS, but it is no longer necessary, and can be
                    completely avoided if that is the way the user wishes
                    it to be.
_____________________________________________________________________________

    APPLE MYTH #2:  In order to run a CD-ROM title on an IBM compatible,
                    you must "configure dipswitches and jumper settings."

    REALITY CHECK:  Running a CD-ROM title on a PC requires nothing more
                    than putting it in and installing it in much the same
                    way required by Macintosh computers.
_____________________________________________________________________________

    APPLE MYTH #3:  IBM compatibles have no multinedia capability off the
                    shelf.  You need to purchase speakers, a sound card, and
                    a CD-ROM drive in order to acquire this capability.

    REALITY CHECK:  Every IBM compatible on the retail shelf comes with
                    full multimedia capability.  In fact, most come with
                    better quality speakers than the Macintoshes do and
                    have MPEG capability (Power Macs do not).
_____________________________________________________________________________

    APPLE MYTH #4:  IBM compatibles have no video editing capability under
                    any circumstances.

    REALITY CHECK:  All of those people using Snappy! (hardware based video
                    editor) with their IBM compatibles must be performing
                    miracles.  (NOTE:  The commercial led the consumer to
                    believe that all Macintoshes are video editing capable
                    right off of the shelf.  In fact, only one lower end
                    model, the 6220 ($1999 before monitor), comes with
                    this capabilty.)
_____________________________________________________________________________

    APPLE MYTH #5:  IBM compatibles are not Plug n' Play.

    REALITY CHECK:  Many IBM compatible peripherals, OSs, and other hardware
                    are P n' P capable.  This is slowly becoming an
                    industry standard, especially now that Windows95
                    supports P n' P.
_____________________________________________________________________________

    APPLE MYTH #6:  IBM compatibles come with little or no software.

    REALITY CHECK:  Packard Bell, Acer, Compaq, Hewlett Packard, and IBM
                    have between $1700 - $2500 worth of software pre-loaded.
_____________________________________________________________________________

    APPLE MYTH #7:  IBM compatibles cannot be just "plugged in" and booted.

    REALITY CHECK:  Most of the major manufacturer's of home PC's are color
                    coding all of their cables and including posters
                    illustrating set-up.  On the Macs you must plug in the
                    mouse, the keyboard, the monitor, and the printer, if
                    you have one.  On the IBM compatibles you must plug
                    in the mouse, the keyboard, the monitor, and the printer,
                    if you have one.  I don't seem to be able to detect the
                    difference.
_____________________________________________________________________________

    APPLE MYTH #8:  The Internet is E-World and vice versa.  IBM clones
                    have more trouble on the Internet than Macintoshes do.

    REALITY CHECK:  Let's see...  There are 7 or more major GUI based
                    Suites of Internet Software for IBM clones.  There is
                    one Suite of Internet applications for the Macintosh.
                    E-World is *not* the Internet, despite what Apple
                    tells its' customers.
_____________________________________________________________________________

    APPLE MYTH #9:  There are thousands of CD titles available for the
                    Apple platform, not to mention that Apple has the best
                    games.

    REALITY CHECK:  The only reliable place to find Mac software is in Mac
                    catalogues.  Many retail stores carry thousands of
                    titles for the IBM platforms, and less than 100 for
                    the Mac platform.
_____________________________________________________________________________

   APPLE MYTH #10:  Macintoshes are better because schools use them.

    REALITY CHECK:  IBM's are better because businesses use them.  (The
                    fact is that you cannot say that one platform is better
                    than the other based on where/when you may use them.  It
                    is faulty logic.)
_____________________________________________________________________________

   APPLE MYTH #11:  IBM clones are useless educationally speaking because
                    they do not have the Mac based WORLD OF LEARNING
                    SOFTWARE.

    REALITY CHECK:  There are just as many (if not more) educational titles
                    for the IBM clones as there are for the Macintoshes.

        Personally, I feel rather insulted that Apple would expect me,
as a consumer, to believe all of these outright lies.  In my eyes this is
a clear example of false advertising, or at least misrepresentation of
information.  They used a 2-3 year old all-in-one Compaq unit as their
example for the "IBM compatible of today".  Anyone who knows anything about
the PC industry knows that *anything* from that "long" ago is outdated by
now.  The bottom line is that they make false claims about their own
products, insinuate several things that are simply untrue about other
non-Apple products, and then ask you to spend money on their products as
a result of these lies.  No wonder they are laying people off.  If this
tye of treatment insults you (and it should), feel free to contact Apple
themselves about their claims and ask them to prove that they are indeed
true.  You can SNAIL them at:

                              Apple Computers, Inc.
                            900 East Hamilton Avenue
                                M/S73-PC Dept. I
                               Campbell, CA 95008

        NOTE:  Their claims that Windows95 is MacOS '84 is also untrue.
               According to an Apple Representative that I spoke with, he
               said that the MacOS is not, and never has been,
               mulithreading.  This is an important feature of Windows95.
               Prior to Micro$oft's new OS, Unix variants have had this
               feature prior to 1984.  So much for that.
