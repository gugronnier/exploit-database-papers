                                Losing It
                                ---------

Nervous fingers clumsy undid the first few buttons on my jeans, exposing 
untouched skin. Slowly I laid down on the large cold metal chair, in the 
corner of the room and shut my eyes....mentally preparing myself for what 
was about to happen. I felt him, inching closer, my body now tense with a 
mixture of fear and anticipation. His breath against my navel, icy like a 
cold winters night, sent shivers racing down my spine. Desperately I fought 
to silence the voices screaming in my mind ...YES!..NO!...STOP!...GO! 

I heard his voice, "Relax this will only hurt for a minute, and its 
smooth sailing from there". I tried to concentrate on the low buzzing 
sound that seemed to be amplified by the four white walls. I  stuck in what  
became my self-induced prison. A surge of pain rushed through me with the 
fierceness of a lighting bolt. To late for second thoughts......

FUCK...FUCK...FUCK 

He was in and continued to jab his instrument into my skin. Breaking the 
thin barrier that separated us, realizing a drop of blood that slowly 
trickled down my inner thigh. He insisted on rambling trying to make 
light of the situation. I refused to smile, or even budge, the fear of 
moving and distorting what was happening kept me firmly in place. I 
became his canvas, submissive to the sting of his touch. 

After listening to the tick-tok of my wrist watch for what seemed to be 
an eternity (in reality it was only forty minutes), it was over. A thick 
creamy white gel covered my wound of tainted purity. 

I stood up and buckled my jeans with a new found confidence. Walking 
out of that room a new-found freedom spread through me faster then 
the plague, I felt as if I could fly, the only thing that kept me grounded 
was the pain I still carried, a badge of experience. Walking through 
the streets of the east village, I wondered how many others shared my secret.
Stained innocence a small price to pay for the orgasmic mixture of pleasure and 
pain I felt at that moment.

Although defiance is a drug more addicting then heroin;  I prayed my 
mother wouldn't find out. I could hear her saying, "Nice girls don't do 
things like that." Standing in my room with the full moon my only 
companion, I got undressed and removed the bloody napkin from my hip. 
Slowly unveiling the blue rose that had become a permanent part of me.
