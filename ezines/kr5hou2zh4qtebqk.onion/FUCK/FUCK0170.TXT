                             What am I doing?
                             ----------------

People at work never cease to amaze me.  They see me pounding away at my
workstation and they feel they need to come by and lend me a piece of their
valuable wisdom.  They say "You should get out more" and "You need to get a
life".  They throw in a friendly pat on the back, a concerned look, and a
chuckle to take the edge off, but we both know they mean what they say.

I am amazed every time someone refers to me as a "Computer Geek" or
"Computer Nerd" at work.  I understand most of "them" are aging yuppies
who have trouble grasping Microsoft Word and barely understand my job, but
the condescension still shocks me.  When I am working at my PC, they refer
to it as "Playing with my computer".  Playing?  I never refer to them as
"Playing with accounting" or "Playing with marketing".  Oh no!  Their jobs
are serious.

But it still makes me wonder, am I a "geek"?  What is a "geek"?  I thought
a "geek" was some worthless fool who is useless to everyone.  Is this what
I do?  What do I do?  Following is exactly what I am doing at this very
moment.  I decided to write it down to see if I really am a "geek" with
"no life".

I am currently running Window's File Manager where I am mapping a network
drive to a Sun Sparc 1000 on my Novell Netware 3.12 network using the NFS
protocol.  Not only do I have access to the Sun's drives, I mapped more
than a dozen logical drives to volumes on the Novell file server which is
running on a Compaq Proliant 2000 that I built.

A window just popped up on my screen to remind me to rotate the  4mm DAT
tape that my database server uses for backup.  I automated Schedule+ to
remind me every day at 5:00.

I am logged on as root in another window to my Sun Sparc 1000 using a
Window's based VT320 terminal emulator.  From root I am checking up on the
Sun's performance using command line utilities like "/usr/ucb/ps -aux |
sort -r +2 -3 +3 -4 | head -20" and "iostat -xtc".

In another terminal window I am logged into my company's Oracle Financial's
Database as sysadmin.  I am currently in the View Concurrent Requests
screen where I am issuing database queries to see what concurrent processes
are running.  I am about to change screens to the report form where I will
run the Active Users report.  The report queues on the Sun and is then sent
to an HPIVsi laser printer thats connected to the network via a JetDirect
card.

In the background, I am logged onto my Internet account via a 9600
baud Hayes modem on my desk.  I am FTP'ing some underground
'Zines from etext.org that I have been looking for and stashing them
on a floppy disk.

I have Microsoft Mail up and running too.  I have set it up to recieve not
only e-mail, but Internet e-mail and faxes as well.  In fact, from here I
can manage the entire, 1000+ user e-mail system and remote dial-ins.

I have Microsoft Schedule+ running as well.  I am using it to track multiple 
projects with numerous individual tasks which are all rated by priority.  I
jump into Schedule+ whenever I need to organize my time.

In another Window I am designing custom database reports using Oracle Report 
Writer 2.0.  I am running it in client/server mode using SQL*Net.  The
report I am working on is an Invoice Register for our Accounts Payable
Department.

Finally I have Windows Cardfile sitting on the desktop.  I have it setup
like a Rolodex and I refer to it whenever I need to call a vendor or tech
support.

Oh yeah, I'm writing this little note in Notepad too.  As soon as I get 
done, I am going to logout of all these systems, grab my leathers, and
zip down the elevator to the parking garage where my Jeep is waiting.
My girl friend is waiting at my apartment for me and when I get there,
we are headed off to the hottest bar in Downtown.

And they call people like me "geeks".  They say I should "get a life".
Well, instead of getting a life, I will just go play with my computer, and
let them do their important adding/accounting and drawing/marketing.

I wish *I* was cool like them!
