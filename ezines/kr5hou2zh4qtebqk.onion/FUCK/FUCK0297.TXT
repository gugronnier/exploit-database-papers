                  Imagine the Possibilities
                  -------------------------

        Imagine the possibilities. Enter a world where a
person's creative thought is not diminished by a teaching
establishment that does not really promote learning. Open
your eye's to a whole new world, where students provide
their own motivation, and teachers can spend more time
focusing on the subject matter at hand. Imagine the
possibilities of a world of information, a world of pure
freedom for the mind. In such a place, the possibilities 
would be simply endless, a place without barriers.
        There are many students who do not feel academically
challenged with school. For that reason, they are likely to
slack off and humdrum through many of their classes, for no
other reason then pure boredom. They are likely to achieve
adequate grades, but not grades that are equal to their
mental competency. Imagine a world where these students 
minds were challenged, perhaps for the first time in their
life. A world where the students creative thought is not
only looked upon as significant, but is openly endorsed.
Enter a world where doing something innovating is as 
important as following an academic tradition.
        Many teachers complain that they are unable to
properly motivate their students. Imagine the possibilities
that could exist if students could motivate themselves.
An existence where they would strive for academic and
social excellence, and achieve it. In this place, students
would possess the sole power to guide their futures. And
as such, if they were not motivated, they would achieve
nothing.
        Today the idea of a world of information is 
becoming a reality. No longer is the mind restricted
to the purely physical. Due to scientific breakthroughs
with communications technologies, the mind can expand its 
barriers to encompass more every day. Envision a world where
information holds the key to success, and it is sought after.
In such a world, skin color, nationality, and religious bias
would not play a role. The mind would be liberated.
        Thinking of what can be accomplished is only
one of the key parts to integrating this or any plan. 
Through coordination and planning, such an existence
could materialize. No longer would students and those
who seek information be thrust into academic jails. For
in such a world, information would be free.
