                                -------

        I'll keep this one short and simple since I can't really think
of a good intro. Short and to the point...

        How many bumper stickers have you seen saying "Abortion is Wrong!"
or something like that. Too many no doubt. I see them all the time. Over
and over you see someone voicing their opinion about something here or
there, and usually it ends at a sticker, a small sign, a passing thought 
in conversation, or something totally harmless. How bout those people
that keep going and bitch all the time? You ever bombarded with shit from
someone bitching about the same thing over and over and over and over etc.?
At some time you have been I bet. It is human nature to bitch it seems, 
although I really don't know why.
        What good is bitching about something? It doesn't do shit just
complaining endlessly about something. It helps no one, gets nothing 
accomplished, and usually pisses someone off whether you know it or not.

        Don't like abortion? Don't have one.

        Don't like chinese food? Don't go to a chinese resteraunt.

        Don't like someone? Don't hang around them.

        Don't like fast drivers? Stay out of the fast lane.

        Don't like stupid videos? Don't watch MTV.

        Don't like a series of text files? Don't read them.

        *

        Don't like anything, don't do it....but most of all.
        
        Don't fucking bitch about it.

        If you don't like something, and you feel a need to bitch about
it, then do something to change it or shut the fuck up. Don't like
a class you are taking? Drop it. Don't like text files? Delete them.
Don't like Bud Dry, buy Miller Genuine Draft. You get the idea.
        If you bitch about something, change it, or shut up. Plain and
simple.
