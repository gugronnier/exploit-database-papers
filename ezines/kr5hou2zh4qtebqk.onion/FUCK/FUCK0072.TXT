                                   Rag Wars
                                   --------

    Having gotten home from a weekend ski trip, I turned on my monitor to 
check what had happened during the three days that I was gone.  My bulletin 
board is fairly popular in the area, and lots of different kinds of people 
call it daily.  Scanning through the activity logs I noticed that there was 
very little activity on the board.  Only about 20 callers per day, when I 
averaged about 40.  Wondering what was up, I read the few pieces of mail 
that were in my mailbox.  Here is a sample of what I had in almost all of 
the feedbacks:

    "Hey.
        I am sick of this board.  I have called two times and only ran into
        childish bickering and flame wars.  Please delete my account.

                                    -Naked Gumby"

    Needless to say, I was pissed after reading complaints and bitches from
about 5-10 users.  The other pieces of mail that I received contained some
variations of the following:

    "   Damn.  I am pissed off at M0rph­ïð.  Please delete him from the board
    or I won't call back.  He is a fucked up loser, and if he doesn't go, 
    then I do...
                                        -Dimensional Vortex"

    "   Why does dV have to be so fucking stupid?  I mean, shit, he has to
    be so close minded as not to see it my way?  Shit.  Do something about
    it.
                                        -M0rph­ïð"

    "   I have to side with M0rph­ïð.  He is soooo right it is not funny.
    Solve this problem for me.  dV is an asshole.

                                        -Inner Cycle"

    "   Fuck you.  If you don't do something about this, I will.  Don't mess
    with me.  I mean, jeeze, Dimensional Vortex is right on in this issue.
    
                                        -Death By BBQ"

    What is the fucking deal?  Scanning through the board I discovered what
no sysop or mature user wants to see.  A rag war.  A conflict had arisen
between two users over how to pronounce '.GIF'!  Talk about the pointless 
shit lamers like to fight about.  They decided that it was so important that  
the entire BBS system had to hear about their bullshit.  It escalated to the 
point that it enveloped the entire board. I found that the friends of 
the two users involved also decided to join in on the lameness, and as the 
story always goes, legitimate users were getting pissed off.  My automessage 
said "FUCK YOU dV!" and messages contained the same.  Text files were 
uploaded to the board with descriptions of "Eat me" and "Fuck M0rph­ïð!  
It's giff you asshole!", etc...  What's the fucking point?

    Well, the above story is a compilation of all the shit that lamers will
go through in order to be recognized.  All of the names are real of course, 
because well, lamers will be lamers.  You all have run into similar 
situations of varying degrees on at least one board you call.  Because, 
there always will be lamers who wish to show off.  And if you haven't?  
Then you are either sheltered as hell, or live in the utopia of all area 
codes or something.
    The main thing I am trying to say is that no one likes a rag war.  It
pisses sysops and users off.  What results from the above account?  Nothing
but annoyed users and sysops.  The people involved in such a flame war are 
normally deleted and they are tagged as problem users for a long time.  I 
sure as hell wouldn't let a flamin' lamer on my board.  All it does is 
bring the quality of my board down.  They are trouble, and obviously stupid 
and immature to think that because a modem and phone line separates them, 
that they can do whatever they want.  All its proves to me is that they 
don't respect the systems they call and the people they come in contact with.
     Grow the hell up.  If you have a problem with another user, keep your
complaints to email.  Don't take everything so seriously and don't get others
involved.  If you do, you are inviting trouble.  And I hope you get all that
you deserve (Like a bullet in the fucking head).  That is all I have to say.
