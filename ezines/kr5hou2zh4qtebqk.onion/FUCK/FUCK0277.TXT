                                Nice Dreams
                                -----------

With a din of noise I wake from my long slumber,
Wishing that it would be two hundred hours later instead of now.
I sit up in bed, still surrounded by the feeling of death warmed over,
Still wishing that I could go to back sleep to rid of that feeling.

But the radio goes on with mindless chatter,
And I get out of bed to start another day.
As I stand in front of the mirror I am reminded of last nights dream,
And I shutter as I try to forget that nightmare plagued me last night.

I can recall that nightmare in all its frighting entirety,
That the nightmare has forever burned itself into my very soul.
And that it will only remove itself when I have taken my very last breath,
And when darkness silences my eyes forever.

I can still see the accusing giants standing over me,
Charging me with crimes that are still not clear.
I can still remember falling in the bottomless blackness,
As the howling wind passed my ears.

I can remember having the thousands of spot lights pointed at me,
And the thousands upon thousands of eyes looking at me.
Of being suspended over a pit of dangerous snakes,
And being slowly lowered into the pit.

Of seeing the disembodied creatures all around me,
And as they slowly closed in on me.
Or of being surrounded by blazing fire,
And no escape in sight.

All these visions that I can recall of that terrible dream,
Still dance sickly in my half conscious head.
So as I reach into the sink to splash my face,
I wake to the sound of the mindless chatter of my alarm clock.
