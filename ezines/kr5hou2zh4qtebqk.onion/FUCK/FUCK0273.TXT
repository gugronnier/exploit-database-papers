                        They Don't Know Better
                        ----------------------

        I met a girl today. Less than 36 hours later I wanted to kill
just about every male in her home town. When I say I want to kill these
people, it is more than an idle threat. If she asked me to, I would.
There is no doubt in my mind that I could, and would, do it.
        So what would drive me to that level of hatred and anger, that
desire to rid the world of human lives. That action that could get me
a lifetime in jail, or death to myself. Three seconds of gunfire in return
for years of drawn out legal battles followed by life in a ten by ten
square room.

        I know I have harped on this to my friends and girlfriends in
the past. They are probably tired of me showing my hatred toward this
one thing, but deal with it. There are too many in our society, all
hurting us every day. I know I have been vague enough so you probably
can't guess exactly what it is, but I can assure you, you have most
likely run into it in the past.
        Degenerate abusive guys who don't have the first clue about
treating others, especially girls. I'm not talking about the inconsiderate
guys who don't pay attention to their girlfriends/fiances/wives. I
am talking about the most severe kind of loser who mentally and physically
abuses their significant other for whatever reason they have convinced
themselves of. Until recently I thought it was a fairly rare case that
this happened, but the more days that go by, and the more girls I meet,
the more I question that number. Based off what I have seen in the past
few days, there are entire towns with over twenty thousand losers like
this.

        So I'm out of state with a friend, visiting some of her old
friends from her home town. Some of her friends are really good people
and very down to earth. They have no false facades, no fronts to put
up for me or anyone else. They are very modest, truthful, and all victims
of past abusive relationships. My new femme friend is a rare individual.
I think it is a combination of her strong will, sense of individuality,
and desire to do what she sees right. There is only one problem I can
find in her.. her ex-boyfriends.
        The second day I was there she awoke to find all four tires of her
car flat. Apparently, while we were at a bar the night before, one of
her ex's didn't like the fact she was with me (or any other male). His
way of showing his continuing love to her was to pop her tires. This is
also not the first time he has gone out of his way to piss her off.
        I don't know the circumstances behind everything, but one ex held 
a gun to her head, others have physically abused her, one tried to rape her,
one has taken thousands of dollars from her in cash and furniture, and
more. What bothers me the most about all of this is her reaction to
these events. They have become so common in her life, that she thinks it
it is a normal occurance. From what I have heard from her and others,
every female in this backwards town expects some form of abuse or another
during their relationships.
        Beyond being completely fucked up, it gets more baffling believe
it or not. Now that she has a non abusive friend (who also has a job,
knows how to clean, is halfway nice, etc), she is actually having a very
hard time coping with it. She is honestly intimidated and scared by our
potential relationship. Why? Because I am not the fucked up, backwards
ass, loser, degenerate abusive boyfriend she is used to. What the fuck..

        So I am in a town where this is common, and accepted. I look around
at the place and consider the population (36800 or so) and think to myself.
Is this just one town out of thousands with this problem? Or do many
midwestern towns about this size suffer the same thing? If not, then a
full scale surgical military strike on this town is fully warranted. If so,
then I think we have a new national crisis to deal with. Consider the amount
of towns out there like this, multiply to find the total loser count, and
I think you would be quite alarmed.
        After meeting a few guys that fall into the above category, I truly
wonder what makes a girl fall for scum like that. I also wonder why girls
let these guys get away with half of the shit they do. Most of the guys
I met have nothing going for them except this macho bravado they throw
around like the presidency. I do understand getting trapped in a relationship
if you are in love, and I do understand it can be hard to leave because
of problems in fear of retribution. I don't understand how it can happen
over and over like clockwork.

        Back to the big guns in loser's faces. What else do they deserve?
Certainly no sympathy or understanding. The only thing I can think fitting
for this situation is death or removal of the ability to function in society.
Why do they deserve it? Because of the basic lack of understanding, respect,
sympathy, compassion, morals, ethics, and everything else that should be
considered when dealing with other people. To consistently treat all girls
(or guys as they case may be) like shit for any reason is wrong. It is along
the same lines as racism, the global hatred or dislike based on one feature
of a person.
        Now you may be thinking "chill out dis, this is one girl, one town,
one incident." Wrong. I have seen this in several small towns myself, and
have talked to dozens of females from others that have told me the same
thing. That makes me think it is a nationwide problem; a problem that
can't be solved in this generation. That level of a problem can not be
de-programmed from an individual because of the way we are. Certain
fundamental beliefs that are developed from society and parental influence
can only be masked, suppressed, and sometimes altered on the surface.
Rather than remove the bad beliefs, they can only be slightly changed
at best.
        The next step is to hit the next generation at a young age, and
make sure they aren't brought up with the same contempt based on a single
feature like skin color, age, nationality, etc. The problem there lies
in the locality. These people are brought up in small towns often led
by community officials with the same values. They are taught by educators
with the same beliefs. In order to change a younger generation, it would
require an unpolluted environment in which to work. Not going to happen.

        That puts us back to square one. A big problem that has no easy
solution. Much like other problems in today's society, there seems to be
little that can be done. I guess what really bothers me is the common
sense or fundamental lack of respect involved with this. I honestly thought
it was human nature that kept people in check. I thought that hurting
someone like that would make one develop a level of guilt that would
make them seriously reconsider their actions, and possibly stop them from
doing the same thing.
        I guess I am different. Maybe that is one thing that bonds me to
my friends and makes me appreciate them so much. Maybe that is also why
I seem to be drawn to the type of girl that isn't used to being treated
right. I wish I could show every single girl in an abusive relationship
that things can be better, and that I know hundreds of guys who know how
to treat women.

        In some cases, I think they simply don't know better.
