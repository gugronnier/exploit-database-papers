                            "It's not my fault."
                            --------------------

Whenever somebody says that, odds are it is their fault.  There is
a plague in this country today.  Nobody is willing to accept
responsibility for their own actions.  Everything that happens is
somebody elses fault.

Buy a cup of hot coffee and spill it on yourself?  Not your fault;
sue whoever sold you the coffee (and win!).

The deficit is out of control, but none of the politicians are to
blame.  The Democrats did it.  The Republicans did it.  And it
isn't your fault that they are in office.  You didn't vote for
them.  But did you vote against them?  No, because there wasn't
anyone else worth voting for, so it wasn't your fault.  

Bad grades?  Not your fault, it's the lousy teachers.  If they
weren't so incompetent you might actually go to class once in a
while.

Getting a nice welfare check from the government?  Yeah, but it
isn't your fault that you can't find a job.  With an economy this
bad, there isn't really any point in trying to find one.

Well, isn't that nice?  No matter what happens, there is always
somebody else to blame.  Nobody has to be responsible for anything. 
Wonderful.

But what is the end result?  Well, for starters, the government is
more than willing to step in and accept our responsibility for us. 
And we gladly surrender it to them; after all, we don't want to be
responsible for ourselves.  But along with the responsibility, we
sacrifice our rights as well.  If you want the same level of
responsibility that a five-year old is expected to have, you can
have it.  You will also have the same freedoms that a five-year old
has.  Fair enough?

The politicians become more powerful (but remember, they too will
always have someone else to blame when something goes wrong).  The
lawyers will become more prolific; they have a full-time job
proving in court that everything that happens is somebody elses
fault.  The insurance companies become richer, since everyone is
suing the people that they blame for their own actions.

How hard is it to admit that you are responsible for your own
actions?  Impossible, it seems.  It shouldn't be.  It can't
continue to be.  People must accept responsibility for themselves. 
Sometimes, it may be difficult to admit that you screwed up, and
accept whatever the consequences may be.  But it will be far easier
than living the rest of your life with somebody holding your hand,
telling you what you can and can not do.  

This entire nation must stand up and say, collectively, "I did it. 
It is my fault."  And then, everyone can move on and start trying
to fix the problems that we see all around us.  Once we stop
spending all our time trying to establish blame, and begin working
on solutions to problems, things just may start to improve.
