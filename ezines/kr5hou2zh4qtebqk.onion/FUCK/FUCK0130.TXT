			     It's My Fault
			     -------------

	Well, I guess I should start by introducing  myself before I get into
all  this stuff.  It  might be helpful for  you to know my background or else
you might  try to pin some  stereotype on me.  I hope  you will  keep an open
mind through it all.

	My name is Joe.  Joe American if you really want to know.  I am about
32 years old and have lived a very interesting life.  I have resided in many,
many different  parts of the country and many  different lifestyles.  I lived
in  a run-down apartment in the  deep depths of Harlem.  I  spent  part of my
life  in  a  multi-million  dollar  house on  Perfect  Dr. in the  middle  of
suburbia.  Where else?  I was  a plantation worker in Georgia, a beach bum in
California,  and  a  farmer  in South  Dakota.  I  have  served  as  mayor of
Smallville in the heart of Nebraska, and even spent part of my life in the US
House  as  a  Representative  from Oregon.  I think that you  can get a brief
picture of my lifestyle from this.

	The reason I  pulled  you aside  today is because  I want  to clarify
something.  I  understand  that  you  have  been  less  than  happy  with the
direction of our  society lately.  In fact,  the long rants  and stories  you
have  told  me give me a clear  impression of your  frustration with life.  I
feel your pain and can identify with you.

	What I  want  to clarify is  this:  It's all my fault.  I am to blame
for the  corrupt world that you have to live in today.  I have contributed to
the evils of  our society.  I am sorry.  I know that may not mean much to you
but I  didn't know  what  I was  doing until  it  was much  too late.  Please
forgive me...

	What?  Why am I at fault?  Well, I think the reason if obvious.  It's
not?  Gosh,  I guess I will tell you then.  I thought everyone understood it,
I guess I was wrong  yet again.  You  see, I am corrupt.  I cannot escape it.
It is an  obsession I  have; to do whatever I can to make my life the best it
can  be.  However I seem  to forget to  watch out for  other  people.  I lie,
cheat, and  manipulate  those around  me in  order to  get  what I ultimately
desire.  No matter  how hard I try, I cannot change my ways.  In fact, I have
come to expect  and accept it.  I know that I will be corrupt in my living in
order to  get what I  want and I have realized this.  Once again though, I am
sorry.

	Because I  am corrupt I  have corrupted my family.  They have come to
follow my  ways and become what I am, solely because I have influenced  them.
My constant presence among them has allowed my corrupt ways to filter through
their defenses and directly affect them. You see, I created a corrupt family.

	My  family has corrupted  my Church.  I am  not sure how it happened,
but  it did.  I feel  terrible.  My  church is no longer  responsible for the
guidance of its members.  Now it  just watches out  for  itself as an entity.
I have created a corrupt Church.

	My Church  has corrupted  my  neighborhood.  I  guess  the  level  of
influence it has had was greater than I thought.  The parent council has been
caught  receiving  bribes,  the  school  board  laundering  money,   and  the
homeowners association  regulating every aspect of our lives.  But you cannot
blame  them  because I was the one to introduce this corruption.  I created a
corrupt neighborhood.

	My neighborhood has had a large impact on my city.  Crime is rampant,
but that is only because we fail to recognize the laws that were made to help
us,  and new  laws have  replaced them that feed the corruption.  But that is
all negotiable for the right price.  I have created a corrupt city.

	Needless  to say, my city has corrupted my state.  The parent council
members are  now in state  government.  They  have replaced  the hard working
government  of  yesterday  to  form  the  "new"  government.   Crime  is  now
uncontrollable on a state-wide scale, yet the state government sees no reason
to stop  controlling  the lives of  the "law-abiding" citizens to control the
problem because  that's  where  the money is.  They  are just looking out for
Numero Uno.  I created a corrupt state.

	Well,  if I  had known  it would get  to here I would have changed my
ways long ago.  We just  sent our  governor to the  presidency.  He  is doing
great there, but he has had  a few legal  problems.  Its  nothing that  isn't
expected  from  everyone else, so I think we will just forget about it.  They
just  passed  that new censorship  law.  Good,  it's always  a good  thing to
silence those dissidents who speak out against the government.   That's okay.
No big deal because I have created a corrupt country.

	The UN  just  invaded a small island off of the coast of Italy.  They
wanted the  resources that the island had to offer.  They blamed it on ethnic
reasons,  but everyone  knows that  isn't the whole truth.  But that's okay I
guess.  They  are  just going where the cash is.  Nothing  at all  wrong with
that; I have done it several times.  By the way, did I  tell you?  My brother
is the ambassador to the UN.  I have created a corrupt world.

	Maybe if I change my ways I can  reverse the whole process.  Maybe if
I turn around  and say  no to  the corruption  I can fix the  problems we are
having.  Well, maybe not...  Just looking out for Number One.

	It's all my fault.

						Sincerely,
						Joe America
