                                Memorial
                                --------

Recently I got pissed at some lamer who made a shitty Jerry Garcia joke. 
Something to the effect of "I'm greatful he's dead, ha ha." I asked him 
how he thought Garcia's family and friends felt at his death. Don't get 
me wrong; I enjoy a good joke like the ones David Letterman is telling 
(watch out for the LSD on the commemorative stamps, etc.), but the joke I 
read was just plain mean-spirited.

Now here we have a person making stupid, thoughtless jokes who has 
obviously never come very close to death. In general, that is, not 
necessarily his own death. I have, however. I personally came close, I've 
had a grandfather die (admittedly not too close), two uncles, my 
stepfather's dad, a student of mine, and, most recently, a friend of my 
mother's (also not close). All of the deaths in my family were "natural" 
-- that is, one stroke, death from AIDS complications, and a brain 
hemorrhage. My stepfather's dad's death was also "natural" -- cancer. But 
the last two were the hardest to take.

My mother's friend was beaten to death. Her body was found in a park near 
Barnum lake. I didn't know this woman at all, but her death shocked me. 
Reading about something like that in the paper is easy to shut out. It's 
much harder when it's closer to you.

My student was shot to death by gang members. They drove by in a car, 
shouted, "what's up, cuz?" and shot him and his sister. The murderers have 
never been caught. This file is about Glenn Taylor, the young man who 
dared to sit out on his porch with his sister one evening, and was murdered
because of it.

Perhaps "my student" is a misnomer. I am a math and science tutor for 
High School Upward Bound. I help high school kids who are doing poorly in 
school. Glenn was an excellent student in high school, so I never saw 
much of him in my classroom. But in a program of just 70 kids, each face 
is distinguishable from the rest. I saw him twice a week as he came to 
the office to get bus tokens for the next day's classes (our students are 
given additional English and math classes after high school). He saw me 
fucking around with my guitar in the office one day and played some 
blues riffs for me. I showed off a little when he asked me to play 
something, and he grinned and said, "damn, I'm not that good!" and I told 
him, "Yet. You will be, just keep practicing." (as you can see, I like to 
brag).

<note: any direct quotes in this file are paraphrased. I have no idea 
*exactly* what was said>

The first thing most people think when they read "drive-by" and 
"gang-related" in the newspaper is that the shooting was part of a turf 
war and that the person who wound up dead must have been in one gang or 
another. Not in this case. Glenn was an honest person. He did well in 
school. He went to church regularly with his family. He had a future.

It was all taken away from him by a two-bit fuckup whose only future is a 
promising career in drugs, provided he doesn't get himself killed first. 
He will contribute nothing to the world except more drug habits, more 
crime, and more ignorance. Glenn Taylor was so much more than this 
worthless coward who fired on a 15-year-old boy and his sister while they 
were thinking of what might happen at school the next day.

Goodbye, Glenn. We miss you.
