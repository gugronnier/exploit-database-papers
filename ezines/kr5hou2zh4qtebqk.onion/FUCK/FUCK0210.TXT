                             Proof at Last
                             -------------

        This started out as my file written after reading the bible.
As I got further into it, I ran across more and more errors. Halfway
through I picked up two books that are a must read. Both are much
more comprehensive and much more convincing than this file. After
the first two are a few more books worth reading that deal with this
subject.

              The Bible Handbook     W.P. Ball and G.W. Foote
              American Atheist Press      ISBN: 0-910309-26-4
                
              Ken's Guide to the Bible              Ken Smith
              Blast Books                 ISBN: 0-922233-17-9

              The Book Your Church Doesn't Want You To Read
              Tim C. Leedom               ISBN: 0-8403-8908-6

              The Dark Side of Christian History
              Helen Ellerbe               ISBN: 0-9644873-4-9


        Below are the major sections I divided flaws into. Some of
these are flaws in writing, some are flaws in character which goes
against the nature/idea of the bible. Remember, this file is very
imcomplete. I am releasing it because of the books I listed (they
do the job for me) and the overwhelming demand for me to 'back
my argument' during debates.
        Some of the quotes were reworded after reading Ken's guide
as he has a better knack for subtlety than I do. :)

(The bible tells us that God and Satan are the same.)

Chronicles 21:1 - "AND Satan stood up against Israel, and provoked
David to number Israel."

II Samuel 24:1 - "AND again the anger of the LORD was kindled against
Israel, and he moved David against them to say, Go, number Israel
and Judah."

The bible specifies the exact dimensions of the ark. 300 cubits long,
30 cubits tall, 50 cubits wide. A cubit is defined as the lenght
between your elbow and the end of your arm, or about 18-21 inches.
Given this, we can say the ark was 6300 inches long or 525 feet (21x300/12).
We know that it was 630 inches tall or 52.5 feet. The width would have
been 1050 inches or 87 feet. 175 yards long, 17.5 yards tall, and 29 yards
wide. The bible tells us that it was loaded with "two of every sort", and
that the flood lasted 1 year and 1 week. Given the animals, and food
for those animals (we will assume they drank fresh rain water), and the
segregation needed between certain species, this seems impossible.

Genesis 7:11 : God orders Abraham to circumcise his flesh

Leviticus 21:17-23 : "If you have a blemish, are blind, lame, flat nose,
                      or anything superflous, brokenfooted, or brokenhanded,
                      crookbacked or a dwarf or blemish in eye, scurvy,
                      scabbed, or stones broken... blemish of the seed
                      of Aaron.." then you can't go unto the altar or
                      you will profane the sanctuaries.

                      Superflous: long hair? beard? etc

Deuteronomy 23:1 : "He that is wounded in the stones or hath his privy
                    member cut off shall not enter into congregation...

Genesis 4:15 - The Mark of Cain is not bad. The Mark was bestowed upon
               Cain as a mark of protection. God went on to say that
               anyone who messed with Cain, would receive the same
               sevenhold.

Exodus 15:3 - "The LORD is a man of war: the LORD is his name."


Plowshares into Weapons?
------------------------

Joel 3:9-10 - "Proclaim ye this among the Gentiles; Prepare war, wake up
the mighty men, let all the men of war draw near; let them come up:
Beat your plowshares into swords, and your pruninghooks into spears: let
the weak say, I am strong."


Women in the Church
-------------------

I Corinthians 14:34-35 - "Let your women keep silence in the
churches: for it is not permitted unto them to speak; but they
are commanded to be under obedience, as also saith the law.
    And if they will learn anything, let them ask their husbands
at home: for it is a shame for women to speak in the church."


Sounds good, let's borrow that idea.
------------------------------------

Matthew 5:39 - "But I say unto you, That ye resist not evil: but
whosoever shall smite thee on thy right cheek, turn to him the other
also."

This idea was not originated by christians, but by Buddha some 500
years before.


Heaven.. the ideal vacation place
---------------------------------

Revelation 4:6-8 - "And before the throne there was a sea of glass like
unto crystal: and in the midst of the throne, and round about the throne,
were four beasts full of eyes before and behind.
   And the first beast was like a lion, and the second beast like a calf,
and the third beast had a face as a man, and the fourth beast was like a
flying eagle.
   And the four beasts had each of them six wings about him; and they were
full of eyes within: and they rest not day and night, saying HOLY, HOLY,
HOLY, HOLY, LORD GOD ALMIGHTY, WHICH WAS, AND IS , AND IS TO COME.


Quit yelling false prophet
--------------------------

Matthew 6:5-6 "And when thou prayest, thou shalt not be as the
hyprocrites are: for they love to pray standing in the synagogues and
in the corners of the streets, that they may be seen of men. Verily I
say unto you, They have their reward.
    But thou, when thou prayest, enter into thy closet, and when thou
hast shut thy door, pray to thy Father which is in secret; and thy
Father which seeth in secret shall reward thee openly.

(Guess this goes against public prayer?)


Take a number
-------------

Revelation 7:3-4 - "The survivors Saying, Hurt not the earth, neither
the sea, nor the trees, till we have sealed the servants of our God in
their foreheads.
        And I heard the number of them which were sealed: and there were
sealed an hundred and forty and four thousand of all the tribes of the
children of Israel."

Revelations 9:3-4 - "And there came out of the smoke locusts upon the
earth: and unto them was given power, as the scorpions of the earth have
power.
        And it was commanded them that they should not hurt the grass
of the earth, neither any green thing, neither any tree; but only those
men which have not the seal of God in their foreheads."

(Here we have 144,000 Jews that will survive the end of the world
 and ascend into heaven. Everyone else will perish, including all
 christians.)


=-=

Matthew 19:16-17 - "And behold, one came and said unto him, Good
Master, what good thing shall I do, that I may have eternal life?

And he said unto him, Why callest thou me good? there is none good but
one, that is, God: but if thou wilt enter into life, keep the commandments."

Contradiction: Jesus refers to God as a seperate being. No Holy Trinity
here at all.

Weirdness: If none but God is good, then what does that make Jesus?

=-=

Matthew 23:33 - "Ye serpents, ye generation of vipers, how can ye escape
the damnation of hell?"

(Jesus against the Jews)


Family Values from Jesus
------------------------

Luke 12:49 - "I am come to send fire on the earth; and what will I,
if it be already kindled?
        Suppose ye that I am come to give peace on earth? I tell you,
Nay; but rather division:
        For from henceforth there shall be five in one house divided,
three against two, and two against three.
        The father shall be divided against the son, and the son against
the father; the mother against the daughter, and the daughter against the
mother; the mother in law against her daughter in law, and the daughter in
law against her mother in law."


God creates evil
----------------

Isaiah 45:7 - "I form the light, and create darkness: I make peace, and
create evil: I the LORD do all these things."

(Sign of a good natured god?)


Luke 14:26 - "If any man come to me, and hate not his father, and mother,
and wife, and children, and brethren, and sisters, yea, and his own life
also, he cannot be my disciple."


(See also Luke 12:51-53, Matthew 11:34-37)

Homosexuality/Lesbianism
------------------------

Romans 1:26-27 : "For this cause God gave them up unto vile affections: for
even their women did change the natural use into that which is against
nature: And likewise also men, leaving the natural use of the woman,
burned in their lust one toward another; men with men working that which
is unseemly, and receiving in themselves that recompence of their error
which was meet."

Romans 1:26-27 : "..God gave [the idol worshippers] over to shameful lusts. 
Even their women exchanged natural relations for unnatural ones."

Incest
------
Genesis 19:32-35

Genesis 29:15-30 : Jacob wants to have sex with lovely Rachel (his first 
cousin), but her father demands seven years of labor in exchange. Jacob does 
his time, and then on the wedding night Rachel's father tricks Jacob into

first cousin).

Prostitution
------------

Genesis 12:10-20 : Abraham is married to Sarah, his beautiful half-sister. He
curries favor (and grows rich) by allowing the Pharaoh of Egypt to have sex 
with her. He tells the Pharaoh that Sarah is his sister. He fails to mention 
that she is also his wife.

Genesis 30:1-11 : Rachel and Leah battle for Jacob's favor by giving him their
maids as sex partners.

Genesis 30:14-16 : Rachel makes a barter deal with Leah: a night of sex

daughter-in-law after she tricks him into thinking that she's a prostitute..

                 it at that.

Song of Songs 2:3 : "Like an apple tree among the trees of the forst is my
                     lover among the young men.  I delight to sit in his
                     shade, and his fruit is sweet to my taste."

Song of Songs 4:16 : "Blow on my garden, that its fragrance may spread
                      abroad. Let my lover come into his garden, and taste
                      its choice fruits."

Song of Songs 7:1-2 : "How graceful are your feet in sandals, O queenly
                       maiden! Your rounded thighs are like jewels, the work
                       of a master hand. Your navel is a rounded bowl that
                       never lacks mixed win. Your belly is a heap of wheat,
                       encircled with lilies."

Song of Songs 7:6-9 : "How fair and pleasant you are, O loved one, delectable
                       maiden! You are stately as a palm tree, and your
                       breasts are like its clusters. I say I will climb the
                       palm tree and lay hold of its branches. Oh, may
                       your breasts be like the clusters of the vine, and the
                       scent of your breath like apples, and your kisses like
                       the best wine that goes down smoothly, gliding over
                       lips of teeth."

Song of Songs 8:1-2 : "O that you were like a brother to me, who nursed at my
                       mother's breast! If I met you outside, I would kiss
                       you... I would lead you and bring you into the house
                       of my mother, and into the chamber of the one who
                       bore me. I would give you spiced wine to drink, the
                       juice of my pomegranates."

Luke 1:35 : "The Holy Spirit will come upon you, and the power of the
             Most High will overshadow you." (Describing way Mary is to
             be impregnated)

Corinthians 6:18-19 : "Shun fornication! All other sins that a person commits
                       are outside his body, but the fornicator sins against
                       the body itself. Or do you not know that your body
                       is a temple of the Holy Spirit within you, which
                       you have from God, and that you are not your own?"

Corinthians 6:15 : "Do you not know that your bodies are members of Christ
                    himself? Shall I then take the members of Christ and
                    unite them with a prostitue? Never!"

Corinthians 7:5 : "Do not deprive one another except perhaps by agreement for
                   a set time to devote yourselves to prayer, and then come
                   together again, so that Satan may not tempt you because
                   of your lack of self-control"


Adultery

II Samuel 12:11 : "This said the LORD, Behold, I will raise up evil
against thee out of thine own house, and I will take thy wives before
thine eyes, and give them unto thy neighbour, and he shall lie with thy
wives in the sight of this sun."

Rape

Judges 19:24-25 : "Behold, here is my daughter a maiden, and his concubine;
them I will bring out now, and humble ye them, and do with them what
seemeth good unto you: but unto this man do not so vile a thing. But
the men would not hearken to him: so the man took his concubine, and brought
her forth unto them; and they knew her, and abused her all the night until
the morning: and when the day began to spring, they let her go."

Numbers 21:5-6 - "And the people spake against God, and against 
Moses, Wherefore have ye brought us up out of Egypt to die in the
wilderness? For there is no bread, neither is there any water; and

Numbers 31:16-18 - "Behold, these caused the children of Israel, through

with him, keep alive for yourselves."

----------------------------

I Samuel 15:2-3 - "Thus saith the LORD of hosts, I remember that which
Amalek did to Israel, how he laid wait for him in the way, when he came
up from Egypt.
    Now go and smite Amalek, and utterly destroy all that they have, and
spare them not; but slay both man and woman, infant and suckling, ox and
sheep, camel and ass."

(Suckling infants?! What a loving god.)

Genesis 17:14 : Uncircumcised = no christian
                must be curcumcised when 8 days old
                Yet it is a sin to see another's genitals.
                Also numerous passages about wounding of
                 privy parts to be sacreligious

=-=

Genesis 6:11 - "The Earth was corrupt before God and the Earth was filled
                with Violence"

22:2 "thine only son Isaac"

Sarah dies @ age 127 in Genesis, yet everyone else lived near a thousand
years. Why the sudden drop in lifespan?

=-=

Genesis 1:26 "And god said, let us make man in _our_ image"
Genesis 1:27 "So god created man in _his own_ image.."

                Should be 'their' image.

=-=

Joshua 10:12-13 - "Then spake Joshua to the LORD in the day when the
LORD delivered up the Amorites before the children of Israel, and he said
in the sight of Israel, Sun, stand thou still upon Gibeon; and thou, Moon,
in the valley of Ajalon.

And the sun stood still, and the moon stayed, until the people had avenged
themselves upon their enemies. Is not this written in the book of Jasher?
So the sun stood still in the midst of heaven, and hasted not to go down
about a whole day."

(This implies the sun revolves around the earth.. we won't even start
 on why the lord stopped the sun for such a noble cause)

=-=

Question with boldness even the existance of God; because if
there be one, He must approve the homage of Reason rather than
that of blindfolded fear.

                        -- Thomas Jefferson


In the begining, there was nothing. Then God said "Let there be
light." After that, there was still nothing, but at least you
could see.

                        -- Mike Guilmore

"It's interesting to speculate how it developed that in two of the
 most anti-feminist institutions, the church and the law court, the
 men are wearing the dresses."

                        -- Flo Kennedy
