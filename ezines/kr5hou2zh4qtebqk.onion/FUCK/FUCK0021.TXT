                                General Info
                                ------------

        Ok. 20 F.U.C.K. files out there and there is a slight interest
in them. As the header states, this series was started in Jan, earlier
this year. Since then, it has been half a year(which it doesn't seem like)
and only 20 files. Some people may say that is lame, but the people who 
read them, will realize they are of a somewhat decent quality(I hope).
Anyway, there are two active members right now. Two members are on extended
vacation for the summer and a new member is working on his second.
Currently I am writing a majority of them, but that doesn't mean much.
        Since these files are quite diverse, and fairly short, and are
written with little or no guideline, anyone can write one. If you would
like to write for F.U.C.K., then do. Just write the file or a good outline
or even an idea, and upload it to one of the headquarters as FCKID###.TXT .
The file will eventually get to one of the writers who release the files.
Please don't name it as FUCK####.TXT, and UL it to a board.
        There has been a small interest from some sysops, to become an
official F.U.C.K. distribution site. Until I was asked about it, there
wasn't any such thing really. With the growing interest though, and the
desire for these files to get out and circulated, I think it is a pretty
keen idea. So the World Headquarters(sounds impressive eh?) is now
Immortal Hate. 806.745.8879. It is located in Lubbock, Texas and is not
the only 806 board to carry them. We have a new Eastern Headquarters. 
Ionic Destruction can be reached at 215.722.0570. These are the only 
boards that are official sites right now, but the files can be found on
many other boards. If you call either of these boards, it is not guaranteed
you will get an account. I only say this because it is up to the sysop
of each board, as to who gets validated. 
        If you run a board, and want to become a distro site, then here
is what you do. Call somewhere and download all of the current files.
Upload them to their own directory and beside each file, put the description
as F.U.C.K. File ## - <title> . Please do not UL them and fail to put a 
title. With so many diverse files, it is understandable if some of them
are of no interest to some people. If you run a board, and want to carry
the files, but don't care to be an official distribution site, then do
carry them please. The whole purpose of these files, are to make people
aware of what is going on around them.
        If you have any comments, questions, etc about any of the files
or any of the members or anything else, then feel free to mail me at
the following places. WWIVnet #28@8607 or #2@8614. If you have internet
access then you can reach me at z3mar@ttacs.ttu.edu. If you wish to chat
with me, then look for me on IRC as Dam or look for MadMax. I am also
on other nets, but I logon to a local WWIV board daily, and I am on 
internet all the time.
        Is there a future to F.U.C.K? I think so. Locally the files
seem to be DLed quite a bit and talked about here and there. Since a
good amount of the files are bitching about something or another, and
I bitch a lot, there will no doubt be many files in the future. :)
        Also out there, is a file called FUCK-FAQ.TXT . This file is
just a frequently asked question file about the group. It is pretty short
and just contains some common questions about the files. Please spread
that around if you get the chance.
        Another note. I have said it before, and I will say it again. These
files are NOT meant to take away from other text files. There are a lot
of other series out there, many much better than these no doubt. Read them
also. They are what lead to these, and they deserve more support in many 
cases. I am still discovering many smaller series that turn out to be really
good, if not better than the larger series.
        Of note. CDC203.TXT "The Briefing". It is number 203 in the Cult
of the Dead Cow series. I read that the other day and wanted to say to 
the writer, it is fucking brilliant. Very impressive and I wish I had 
thought of it. heh. Also. TOX30.TXT "America: Land of the free. Home of 
the Brave". This is number 30 in the Toxic Shock series. Well written and
very much true.
        I guess that will wrap it up. Take life easy, and think a little
bit. That is all that is needed to make this place a little bit better.
