                     Hypocrisy, the Greatest Luxury
                     ------------------------------

        Hypocritcal dumbshits.  That is what I have to deal with every day.
I'm currently in a small school in Texas, and damn, is it twisted.  The 
school is a heavily religious school, so primarily I'l a gonna talk about
RELIGIOUS HYPOCRISY!  Can I get an amen?
        The biggest group of people in the school are Baptist.  Baptists are
pro-life.  Baptists are also pro-death.  What I mean by that is that they do 
not support abortion, however they feel they have the right to stick murderers
in an electric chair and fry them to a crispy brown/black.  This I fail to 
understand, because the Bible that they claim to read is against murder.  It
is a BAD thing, so why are they able to amend and change that policy depending 
on their opinion of what is guilty and who deserves to die?
        I also have to deal with their shit about morals.  Recently here in 
the local college a girl got pregnant.  No big deal right?  Well, she also 
belonged to a christian college organization.  They proceeded to tell her 
she could not wear the uniform, could not participate, etc.  It was stated that
Everyone else in the little group fucked around, they just didn't get pregnant,
so in essence she was being punished for getting caught, not the lack of moral
fiber.  That is a common thread around this area.  Lots of people fuck, and a
great majority of those are the "Christian Moral Squaders" that are everywhere.
Morals are just fine for the good folk, as long as they can bend them to suit
themselves.  Of course, if any of them is cuaght fucking or pregnant, or 
cheating, or any one of a million little petty moral sins the rest of the 
group is quick to denounce them.  The favorite term around here is "My God, 
they are just so fake!"  Like the "non-fakers" never get laid.  I know for a 
fact that a great many of them are bigger sluts and such than the stoners at
school.  Christians are just better at not advertising it.
        Drinking.  I see no problem with a little now and then, however these
fucking people view me as a drunk because I have like maybe three beers a 
month.  I wonder how many of them have the occasional mixed drink, or maybe
a beer.  Actually, I don't wonder, I know.  The big parties are at "Fuck Lake"
and they are all BYOB, etc.  Good people get wasted just as often as those of
us regarded as "bad".
        That is three of the major points that I have to deal with everyday.
I really have no problem, other than the fact that if you believe in God you 
can bend the Bible to suit your needs.  You can drink, fuck, and kill all for
the Lord.

Just don't get caught.
