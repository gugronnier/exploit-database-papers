                             So-Called Friends

     "Friends", or so they call themselves.  These people seem to 
think that just because you are nice to them, that you are at their 
beck and call 24/7.  This is just wrong, I mean, there are times that 
a person just does not want to do anything, much less put up with some 
incessant bitching about stuff that they could care about.
        The reason I am saying all of this is that this recently 
happened to me with someone that I met about two or three months ago.  
I started talking to her (who shall remain nameless, to not 
incriminate the inncocent [or guilty, whichever the case may be]).
After about a week, I was picking her up from school every 
day, no matter if I wanted to or not.  At this, you might say that I
have no will power of my own, and this is partially true, but i did like  
this her alot.  I feel that she kind of screwed me over, I asked 
her out, and to this day she has not answered me, although I have not
talked to her in about three weeks now.  It bothered me for awhile that
she never answered me, but since then I have talked to various people
about the situation, and have come to the conclusion that she is a bitch,
nothing more, nthing less, and that I could care about the way she feels 
about me.  I was going to trust her with my heart, but she done messed
it all up.  I am not sure if she will ever answer me, but at this point 
in time I know that I do not care one way or the other.  
        The big thing is, she would go on and on about how she did 
not want to choose between the new people that she met through hanging
out with me and my friends and the people that she had always hung 
out with.  After about a month or so, she found out that some of my 
friends did not like her all that much, it wasn't like they hated her, 
it was just that they thought that she was kind of annoying in the way 
that she treated some people, in particular me.  Then she expected me
to choose between her and my friends.  For awhile, afer I asked her out, 
I thought that I would choose her over my circle of friends, but then 
after talking to my friends, my eyes were opened to the fact that she 
was a bossy little bitch who always got her way, no matter what.  
        The point I am trying to make is that a real friend would not
make you choose between them and other people like this girl did to me.
I can see kind of where she was coming from, but I do not think that
it is right for one person to make another choose between them and others.
It is not their place to do so, and it is damned hard on the person
who has to do the choosing.  If you would like to be a good friend
to you friends, do not make them make a decision like that, because it
will make that person a nervous wreck.
        Friends, in my lowly opinion, stand right by their friends in
hard times, slow times, through anything, and will alwys be there.
They do not force each other to make hard, and sometimes heart wrenching,
decisions about who they would rather hang around with.  Sometimes this
can lead to whoever is supposed to make the choice start thinking that
everyone is a total asshole, and that you cannot trust anyone with your
feelings and your heart, but I learned that a long time ago, 
                                              
        Another little bitch that I have is about that 'Let's still be
friends' line that ex-whatevers like to use so much.  I was sitting in
my folks house, visiting and shit, the phone rang and i, of course, 
answered it.  I talked to this person for about 10 minutes before i 
figured out that is was my ex-fiance'.  It turned out that one of her
friends was getting married in the town where i live in a couple days
and she wanted to see me.  Now i haven't seen this bitch in about nine
months, andd here she was, right out of the blue, wanting to see me.  
I drove back the my apartment thinking of all these weird ways to make 
her feel like shit.  But alas, i am too much of a nice guy to do anything
mean and vindictive to her, so i just planned to get myself roaring drunk
by the time she got here.  I started too late, and only had a couple drinks.
She showed up, and I was just a nice guy and acted a little cold towards her.
I guess she still cares about me, but the last thing I told her was 'Have                                      
a nice life.'  I had seen her once since the breakup, and was not, N-O-T, 
looking forward to seeing her.  So after she left, i proceeded to get
TOTALLY wasted out of my mind, and somehow came up with the notion that
guilt can make some parts of a person's anatomy grow to grotesqly immense
sizes, which is what must have happened to this girl.  One of my friends,
when i walked back in the house, said that her butt was large enough to
set drinks and a clock on.  After that, somewhere during the course 
of the night, I thought up the phrase 'She's a Big Bootie Bitch', which
has kinda stuck with me since then.  To some of you out there, reading this
and more than likely hating it, this may not seem like a big thing but to
me, this pretty much sums up what i think of this girl.  She messed up 
the best thing in her life when she got rid of me, but I can now get 
to bigger and better things.

There ya go folks, read it, hate it, love it, or just plain FUCK IT!
