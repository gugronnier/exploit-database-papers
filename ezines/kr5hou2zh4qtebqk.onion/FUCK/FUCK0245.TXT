                 Sick of Being Sick of Being Sick
                 --------------------------------

 Oh jeez, am I sick of angst.  Wow.  You know what I realized the
 other day as I sat scrubbing out the engine compartment of my M1A1
 Abrahms Main Battle Tank?  Life is pretty fucking great.  I mean,
 you do have rough spots..  I will give you that.  And for the abused,
 people who live in streets and those without a marmot to hug I guess
 life sucks...But on the whole for the rest of us its not too shabby.

 My God...  Look at all of the dumb shit you could dwell on day to day
 and think about how miserable you could be.  Woke up late, no coffee,
 fight with parents, computer died and/or bad day at work.  There is so
 much to grind your teeth about every time you wake up and interact with
 the world in any way shape or form.  I know people who do that and
 they just radiate pissed offedness.  That in turn makes them dwell on
 more of the same.  It is a huge bitter cycle.

 I dunno.  I look at it this way:  I get to see things and do things that
 no one will ever experience in the same way.  I joined the Army and threw
 myself into a world of sheer dumbness and numbness.  Roolzez and
 irregulations that make me want to scream from time to time.  Of course,
 on the same plane I got to train with the FIRST EVER Russians to train
 on American soil as a part of Peacekeeper '95.  I've seen sabot rounds
 arc off into the sunset on Range 301 in Germany.  I've been to Iceland,
 Ireland and all over Germany.  I've met great people and people who would
 make great sharkbait.  It all balances out in the end and I even venture
 that it tilts the balance toward good more often than not.

 I've seen bad places.  Belfast when the Sein Finn decided they no longer
 wanted their treaty.  That was a tense town the two nights I was there.
 I've got buddies in Bosnia and I go there in October for 4 to 6 months
 to help cover the withdrawl of IFOR troops.  The people of Bosnia have
 managed to maintain a (if rather grim) sense of humor despite the fact
 that they have over 5 million mines in an area the size of a small state.
 Children regularly call in IFOR troops to remove mines so they can play
 on their own property.  Hey, if these people can stay happy (or a facsimile
 thereof) under the circumstances they have anyone whould be able to.

 People have these great minds, but so often they let them go to waste.
 We recieved all this brain power from nature or God or Dog or Dobbs or
 whatever has dealt it out via evolution with a few minor sacrifices.  I
 mean, who wouldn't like a prehensile tail now and again or some fangs
 on a Monday morning...But, those are gone and now we have to make due
 with superior cognitive powers and the invention of the toaster and its
 electrical ilk.  But why dwell on the negative?

 Wow.  All the dumb shit does make you grow.  It shapes and molds you and
 if you look back on it I'm sure that a majority of those "bad" things
 you put up with had some good side (you know, except for that time you
 were run over by a truck) and if you look for it, you can find it.
 All I'm saying is try and look at all this angst loaded crapola a
 different way.  Blah.
