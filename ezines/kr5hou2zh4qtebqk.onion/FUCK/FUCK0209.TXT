                                "Pain"
                                ------

I'm sitting here sharpening my knife. An hour ago it was sharp enough to
effortlessly shave the hair off of my arm. Now it's even sharper.

Most people don't know what major depression is. When something happens to
upset them or make them sad they identify the problem and try to fix it.
When the problem is solved, these people feel better. With clinical depression,
though, identifying the problem is not enough. Major depression goes beyond
feeling "down" or "blue." Major depression is the result of a chemical 
imbalance in the brain that can be treated with antidepressants. Knowing
all of this logically does not help me understand life, though. At this
point in time I don't feel like trying anymore. I've tried my hardest, and
all it gets me is pain. 

I've given the world everything I have to give but it's given me nothing at
all in return. I don't know if I'll go ahead and use the knife or make 
something to eat and try to struggle through another day instead. Right now
the odds are with the food by about 60% to 40%.

				sincerely,
					anonymous
