                        Being Heard Hurts
                        -----------------

Expressing oneself is a dying art. No longer is it encouraged
by the powers that be. No longer it is sought-after by the
educational process. No longer is it the predominate goal of
all of our country. Why has this goal been dismissed from our
thoughts? Simple, no one wants to think for themselves because
they are all too lazy and dedicated to the one minded logic of
the masses. What is this new goal that is clouding our social,
political, and economical future? The new goal to be achieved
by one and all is very dangerous to free thought, the goal
I am talking about is Conformity. How can you hope to escape
from the barriers? Read on.

Nonconformity is looked down upon for the most part.
Many think of nonconformists as hairy eyed anarchists
who have plans to slaughter millions and massacre the
government. It is just another piece of the systems 
bullshit. There are legendary nonconformists in a place
that you wouldn't even expect to see them, in the
history of the United States of America.

Where can I find this information you ask? Look no
further than the War that revolutionized the entire
world. The War for Independence. I will relate this tale
to you, though I am sure you've heard it countless times.
But I ask you to listen with an open mind, and to sink
in the feeling that the nonconformist viewpoint on certain
subjects can make the world a better place for all of us.

Many early Americans were by definition nonconformists.  
They would not allow their minds to be oppressed by following
the tyrannical rule of Great Britain. For these actions, 
they were punished. But did they simple give up their hopes,
dreams, and goals?  No! They fought back, kicking and screaming,
and they were liberated. After the war, these Americans put
their will power to the test. They grappled the task of 
controlling  a nation, and they succeeded. Today that nation
has risen to become one of the worlds superpowers.
 
How does this effect the discussion at hand? Think of
it this way. If a group of rebels can change the world,
why can you not change your surroundings? Surely, by thinking
for yourself, expressing your views, and having a clear
goal in mind, you will be able to. No one will be able
to hold back the real you. They will not be able to
judge you, you will be the ultimate wielder of power in
your life.

But DropComm, you say, isn't the system going to slam me
into the ground for this? Most likely. Then, why do you 
advise me to do this? For your own good. How can this be
for my own good if it's just going to get me into trouble,
you ponder. I reply indignantly, feeble minded human, this 
process is not meant to land you in unnecessary anguish, 
it is meant to make you learn about yourself, and the 
options that are available that you were to blinded to
see before. You will become the all-powerful person in
your existence. You will not rely on others views to 
contort your ideas. You, perhaps for the first time in
your life, will be free.

If you are having trouble launching your plan to be free
from an intellectual jail, then I have some suggestions for
you. Write down some promises to yourself and come through
with them. In time, you will feel a tinge of responsibility,
and it will grow. You will know the truth, that if you put
your mind and will power towards a goal, that you will achieve
it. I believe that you will feel quite gratified by this
should you carry through with it.

Once you are free from lies and false realities, nothing
can touch you. You will control everything that happens
to you. You will no longer need to rely on others to do
everything for you, you will be renovating yourself. You
will know that nothing can stop you from achieving anything
that your heart desires.

This journey will not be easy. It will not take a short
period of time to complete. There are many things that
you will learn on your adventure. Perhaps one of the most
important is that there is no progress without struggle.
But the one I believe to be most important is, that all
of this will pay off. And one final thing to remember,
in the immortalized words of Bob Marley, everything is
going to be alright.
