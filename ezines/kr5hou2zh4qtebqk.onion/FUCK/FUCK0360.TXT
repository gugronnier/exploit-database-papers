                                Thanks
                                ------

        There are times when it should be said, and there are times
when it is assumed a person is thankful. As time passes with friends,
more and more things fall under the 'assumed' category. However, there
are times when it can't be said enough because of specific and unique
circumstances. One thing this file is not, is a beg for thanks from
anyone. Take this file as my normal rants and observations. Odds are
this file will overlap on some points with another I will be writing
shortly.
        Some people are in a better position to help their friends,
while others are in a position where they are likely to need help more
often than others. It often has little to do with personal actions,
but more with circumstances that occur in a person's life. Sometimes
these events are controllable, while other times they aren't. There is
no way to define or categorize these people or actions.
        As time passes, I find that the people I know thank each other
very infrequently. Thinking more, I find that I probably don't say it
nearly enough. This is by no means a suitable 'make up', but this
will serve as one way to let a few people know that I do appreciate
what they have done for me. The good part is, most of the people who I
feel I should thank read these files.
        From here on out, I am going to try to make an effort to say
that one word more often, and I encourage you to do the same. It takes
a second of your life, and lets someone know that you DO appreciate
them for whatever reason. I doubt I really need to say more at this
point. As usual, just think about it.


        Voyager/Major - For being there at any time. Helping me with
        whatever problems I encountered, and helping me past them.
        For teaching me the finer points of life as well as the finer
        points of computers and technology. Thank you.

        Rage - For showing a new volume of tolerance and understanding.
        For going with the flow of things, being a good friend, and
        being the best roommate one could hope for. Thank you.

        TP - For being a good friend, and always knowing how to look
        at things. When times are bad or weird, you can always point
        out a new way to look at things and get the right perspective
        on it. For continually helping me learn and explore new
        things. Even though I have probably given him the most over
        the past year, I feel that he owes me the absolute least of
        all the friends that I have helped. Thank you.

        Pill/Shaedow - Even though we haven't hung out as frequently
        as others, these two know exactly what friendship is. Both have
        been there for me several times and knowing I can rely on them
        is a good feeling. Thank you.

        Mom - For everything. I am fortunate enough to say that I have
        a very good relationship with my parents, and consider my mom
        a good friend as well as a parent. She has always been there
        when I needed anything, and has gone out of her way to help
        me out with tons of little favors. As usual, I can't thank
        you enough.


        Once again, saying 'thanks' in a file like this is in no way
what they deserve for their friendship and help. It is one way of making
sure they know I am serious and that I mean what I say. So here it is,
once more, thank you.
