                               Fuck You
                               --------

   It's been quite awhile since someone has managed to push my buttons
and fill me with pure rage, but it was bound to happen sooner or later.
It happened this morning.
   I was on the phone with one of my friends, a payphone mind you, in
the middle of a fucking tornado. No joke, I could see the funnel cloud.
   Anyway, there I was, soaking wet, standing in a fucking puddle up
to my ankles, and my friend tells me that one of my ex-girlfriends just
came in the same chat room.
   Well, I hadn't talked to her in about a year, so I asked my friend to
relay to her the same message I give to all the stupid whores who have
fucked me over. I simply told her to fuck off.
   Instead of trying to explain what was said, I'll just include the
transcript. Collision is my friend, Sweet Demon is the whore.

Collision:   InVerse says to fuck off.
Sweet Demon: <runs & hides> InVerse?! Where's he at?
Collision:   I'm on the phone with him.
Sweet Demon: Why would you talk to him?
Collision:   'Cuz he's my friend.
Sweet Demon: How'd he know I was on?
Collision:   I told him.
Sweet Demon: Oh, well did he ever grow up? But then again I guess his
             message answers that.

   Did I ever grow up? That's what pushed me over the edge. I was outside
in 40 degree weather, being pelted with ice cold rain, yet I could feel
my blood begin to boil. The old familiar rage began to rise as my grip 
tightened around the receiver.
   I'm completely against violence against women. I've never hit a female
and I seriously doubt I ever will, but if she had been within even two
hours walking distance, I would have trudged through that fucking storm
and beat her fucking brains in with the biggest tree branch I could swing.
   Anyway, I suppose I should explain *why* that little comment inspired
such intense anger, or else this file will be pretty pointless and boring.
   Whenever we first started going out, I had just broken up with my
girlfriend of 9 months. She was having problems with her boyfriend and
ended up leaving him for me. (I suppose I should mention that this was an
on-line relationship.)
   Anyway, once we started going out she made me promise over and over
again that I wasn't going to get tired of her and dump her. The she was
afraid that she might have gotten pregnant before she broke up with her ex.
We discussed it and I promised her that if she *was* pregnant, I'd help her
raise the baby.
   I had no job and no money and she was still in high school and living
with her parents, so we couldn't exactly be together right then. I made
plans to move down to Texas with a friend of mine so I could get a job,
save up some money, and then move up to New Jersey with her a few months
later.
   Well, like I said, I didn't have any money, so to pay for my bus ticket
to Texas (as well as a plane ticket to NJ so I could go to homecoming with
her) I sold my computer, my guitar and a few other items. And what does
she do? Go on and on about making me promise that I won't sleep with the
girl that I was planning on staying with.
   Well, it didn't matter, because that plan fell through and I ended up
having to move in with my grandmother because my mom kicked me out of the
house when she found out about my plan to move to TX.
   So I joined the Job Corps program. I figured out a plan where I would
be able to move out to NJ just in time for her B-day. But when I told her
about it, she told me not to bother because she had decided that she didn't
love me anymore. (She later admitted to a mutual acquaintance that she
didn't want to have to go that long without sex.)
   So tell me. Who needs to grow up? Me, who gave up everything I had so I
could be with her and help her raise a child that wasn't mine? Or her,
who was stupid enough to get herself in the position to get pregnant in the
first place and then ended a relationship simply because she wasn't going
to get laid for a few months.
   You tell me. I'd like some input from other people to see if my intense
hatred is justified, so if you've got any comments, feel free to send 'em
my way.

Btw: I fully intend to kill her at the first convenient opportunity. =)
