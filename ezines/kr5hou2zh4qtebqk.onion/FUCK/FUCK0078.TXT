    Here we see Joe walking down the street. He is a 29 year old man
with a wife, 3 kids, a car, a house, all the things that come with
life. He is an average man, he loves his life. He wouldn't change
anything he ever did for the world. He was going to the bank as he
does every friday after work. He puts some money into his account,
and puts a little aside for a summer trip to hawaii, and get a little
out so the family can do something fun that day. And today they were
going to go see the Lakers play the Bulls. Joe's son had bought him
a Bulls hat earlier that week as a hint that he wanted to go. Ohh Joe
had it all. He wasn't extremely rich but what he had he liked, and he
liked everything. Joe had on the same suite he wore every friday, and
was whistling a little tune. Everyday was the same for Joe, with just
a little surprise around some corners just to keep him happy. But the
surprise that he was about to receive was one he would never forget.
    Joe was almost to the Bank when he heard a noise, like the backfire
of a car. But sort of different. He heard a sound like something was
flying towards him, then he heard a sound he would never forget, the
sound of bones crushing and flesh tearing. It felt like a fire cracker
had been stuck in him and lit, he felt the bullet fly through his
head and stop, turn around, turn again, and again. Everything he had
loved and cared for, had been ripped the shreds. Everything he had
wanted, had lived for, gone. Everything he wanted to know or already
knew, had been destroyed. He wife, kids, house, car, job, LIFE. All
of it gone, destroyed in one second. As he is leaving his body he
realizes what had just happened.. Joe had been shot. "For What?!"
he asks himself. He looks down at his body as he is floating away
and he sees some teenager, looks like he is in a gang, run up to his
body, take his hat he son gave him, and ran off. All he wanted was the
hat, he didn't take his money, his $1,000 suite, or even his wending
ring.. All he wanted was the $15 hat he would have given to the punk.
    Joe looks down at the world as he is floating away. He sees everything
that goes on. He sees the rapes, as some guy who sees a woman he wants to
have sex with run up and attack her. He sees the murders, in Washington as
some official looking FBI agent shoots a man with a briefcase in the back
of the head, and as 4 Gang members are shot down for wearing their 'color'.
He sees the racism, as a group of KKK members burn a black man and his
family alive, and as a mob of christians beat up 10 jews, killing 3 of
them all in the name of God. He sees the starving people in africa as
many people try to help them overcome this 'disease' that is plaguing
their country, and the starving children in New York city cry themselves
to sleep as even fewer help them. He sees the corruption as Clinton signs
a secret deal with Iraq, we give them two nuclear bombs and they lay low
for a couple of months as the media cools down over the shooting of two
US Helicopters. Joe sees EVERYTHING all in 5 seconds. He understands
everything that happens. He now knows why the government keeps so many
secrets, why that punk shot him for his hat, why everything goes on. And
out of all the trillions of things he sees only two give him his full
attention.
    We are now at a elementary school in South Central Los Angels. It
looks like it is recess time and all the kids are playing around and
having fun, but for some reason there is a group of kids crowed around
two 10 year olds. They are having a fight for one reason or another.
For what? Who knows.. who cares? Joe watches as one of the kids hit the
other in the face, he falls to the ground. About 50% of the kids laugh
as the rest cheer. The kids steps over the fallen one and says something.
You can see the anger build inside the fallen one as he has to listen to
everyone and everything around him. He gets sick of it all. He wishes he
was dead. The Fallen ones starts to say something, then there is silence
and Joe can hear what he is saying... "...die...Die...DIE...DIE!! DIE!!!"
the fallen kid pulls out a gun still yelling "DIE DIE DIE DIE DIE YOU
MOTHERFUCKER DIE!" he pulls the trigger and the kid who won the fight now
joins Joe. Joe understands what happened, and why it did. He is beyond not
understanding.
    Next we turn to another scene. This one only 5 miles away from the
last one. Joe sees three men, all in their 20's beatin some guy who is
also in his 20's. They don't seems to know each other. But the thing
that catches Joe's eye is the car coming around the corner. As soon as
the driver sees what is going on he gets out of his car and runs toward
the helpless man being attacked. The driver seems to know a lot about
fighting as he got all three guys off the beaten man in 2 mins. All three
men run off yelling for revenge. But that doesn't bother him. He helps
the beaten man to his feet and he explains to the driver that they saw
him come from the teller-machine, and they were following him to this
place where they were trying to get his money. The driver helps the man
into his car and they drive to the hospital. The driver made a new friend
today, and later that month their families get together and have a BBQ.
This makes Joe happy. That out of all this violence and all this mayhem,
there are still people out there that care what happens to others. Joe
considers what he would have done if he were that driver. He thinks to
himself that he would have driven to the nearest pay phone and called
the cops. Not being brave enough to do something like that. Joe learned
a lot today.. and then it hits him, he is dead. He cannot go back to his
family and tell them of what he has seen. Joe cries, he cries for all of
the world, for we are all doomed, and there are only a few that care.


Rage.
