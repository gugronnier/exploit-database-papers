Dear Disorder

                 We believe that the acknowledgement of ourselves as
citizens of the earth is a concept in direct conflict with the 20th century
western "philosophy" of egotistical self-importance, which to a large
degree precludes compassion for others.  We think this same premise
inhibits our ability to look beyond the familiar boundaries of reality to
which we cling so desperately.  By even acknowledging the reported accounts
of  human-alien interaction as possible, it must be considered how closely
these events mirror man's own treatment of other members of the world's
community, as well as the planet itself.  We believe that the alien
phenomena is yet another wake up call to our own humanity.

        "The inescapable profundity of the alien presence has become a
source of social pathology in our time.  As a culture, we have not yet
learned how to tell the truth about something so huge, so strange, and so
unexpected.  Individuals who make an honest effort to deal with it often
discover that their personal stability is at risk.  Consequently, the alien
presence requires us all to grow, to become stronger and clearer, and to
help one another to find our way in a genuinely new world."
Michael Lindemann  (futurist, author  and UFO investigator)

         We ask you to consider posting the following announcement (with or
without the preceding paragraphs) in your zine, F. U. C. K.  Although this
information may not seem to apply directly to the subject matter of your
zine, we believe that it does, as the alien phenomena personifies the
moral, ethical and spiritual struggles of the 20th century which impact us
all.  Please allow us to supply your readers with free stickers and info.
If you would like to see the stickers and info please e-mail me your snail
mail address and I would be happy to send them to you.  (If you're
interested, I can also e-mail you the sticker image.)

Thanks for your consideration, K2.
