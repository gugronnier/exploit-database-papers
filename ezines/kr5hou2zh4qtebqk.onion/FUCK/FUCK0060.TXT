                           A F.U.C.K.ed Christmas 
                           ----------------------

        Twas the days before Christmas at your average middle class house in
the suburbs of any Amercian town.  Trees were up, gifts were wrapped, and 
each of the houses on all of the blocks were done up in lights in an attempt
to outdo the neighbors.  Most importantly, there was a feeling of blatant 
commercialism filling the air.
        I hate this season.  I don't hate Christmas because of what it stands
for, namely peace and love and all that, I do however hate the mass market  
that has taken over a perfectly good holiday.  Christmas has lost most if 
not all of its original meaning, and the new meaning filling the void it left
behind is just as empty and vacuous as the season itself.
        Decorating for Christmas starts about the end of October now.  The 
stores obviously feel that the consumers are too stupid to look at a calender
to find the holiday so they begin advertising months ahead of time.  I hate 
walking into a mall before Thanksgiving and seeing Santa's Big Booth of Kiddy
Pictures already set up.  Nothing ruins my day more than seeing some fat 
pedophile already pushing holiday cheer down my throat.  I can say that the 
advertisers and shopping centers have lost the spirit that X-mas is supposed
to hold.
        Many people have lost it totally too.  Remeber when you would look 
forward to seeing all of your relatives and having dinner, and being a <gasp>
family?  No more.  Nope.  Today it seems like more and more people I see care
more for what they get than for their families and the feeling of togetherness
they should have.  I get to see my family rarely, so this Christmas should be
a special treat for me.  So, if it means something to me, why doesn't it mean
anything to millions of others?  Is the family that far gone?
        Ugh, and the materialism that goes with the season.  It is not the
season of giving anymore, it is the season of taking.  The bigger the gift,
the better the love felt towards you.  Since when did this holiday mean 
nothing more to girls than a new Dooney and Bourke bag?  Shouldn't there be
more to this than clothes and accessories?  More feeling than silk and leather
and cotton?  Bah.  The most popular gift this year in my area is going to be 
those stupid fucking $300 dollar purses.  I have talked to about 5 girls who
already plan to sulk if they don't get a new purse.  Nevermind that the cost
of those would buy Christmas for a family who isn't going to have it this 
year.
        I suppose all in all I can say that I am very dissapointed in the
holidays so far.  All I have seen is materialism, greed, cynics (heh), and
the like.  I feel like the season is dead, and the emotion and spirit that
go with it are dead too.  Before I end this file, let me show you a bit of 
symbolism.  In the novel "A Christmas Carol" Dickens portrayed the Spirit
of Christmas Present as a jolly figure.  He was huge, filling a room with his
laughter and light.  Food stacked around him, and music playing in the 
background.  That was beautiful for then.  Now try to picture that same ghost.
I can see him as hollow and gaunt and as empty as the holiday.  Laughing still,
but only as he rips open those gifts he got.  I can see the new spirit now, 
and he is wearing designer jeans.
