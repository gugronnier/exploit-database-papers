                             The Judicial System
                             -------------------

        The Judicial Branch: (n) - The branch of federal, state 
and local government that decides if laws have been broken, and 
that punishes lawbreakers.

        That definition was taken from my high school textbook 
published in 1971.  Does that really define what the judicial 
system does?  I don't really believe so.  Let's break that 
definition down, part by part.

        "The branch of federal, state and local government..."
        Fine.
        
        "...decides if laws have been broken..."
        Ok, this one I have a problem with.  Who are they to 
decide if laws have been broken?  They are all rich old men who
want to make more money, deciding the future of the lives of 
millions of people.  They don't even think about the repercussions
of what they THINK is right.  They base their decisions on Christian
mythology, and practice.  They believe that devil worshippers are 
evil, and thusly, say it's illegal to do this.  Sure, I don't 
particularly like devil worshipers, but what about that little
First Amendment thingy that those old people made so long ago?  The
judicial system has become so corrupt, that they oversee most of the
other rights that people are "given" when they are born (actually,
technically not until they are 18 and not living with their parents,
which is extremely stupid...but not overall stupid.. :))  People of my
generation [the term I suppose is Generation _] have very little rights
as people in this year.  Want to know why?  Because we are considered
the future of the US... wait a minute..  Does the justice department 
not want to expose us to the crime of the US so we can be ignorant
of what happens?  BECAUSE we are the future of the US, we SHOULD have
rights...  
        Back to the issue at hand, laws are good in theory, but are
lame in practice.  The judicial departments are too old fashioned. The
Constitution bases itself on the ability to change.  The ability to 
make new amendments, remove the ones that are no longer useful.  So
don't you think it would be wise to do something about the justice 
in this world?  Maybe tighten it up a bit?  Lets cut the crap, the
justice is too loose.  Back in the 1700s, we didn't have the same 
violence problems that we have now.  Well, there are many reasons 
for this change, the main one is an increase in population.  This 
is the exact reason the violence has changed.  People are finding 
different things to do to piss off the government.  I'm not one to
go around picketing FOR the government, but then again, I believe in
patronage to your own country.  Those who decide that this is a
shitty country can leave for all I care.  Unfortunatly, that's not
the issue right now.  The issue is that people are arming themselves
to defend themselves from people that have armed themselves.  Something
like 1 out of 5 homes has at least one gun in it.  Accessible.  Those
who use these types of weapons inappropriately should be tried, 
convicted, and sentenced to more than 5 years in prison.  What does
that accomplish?  Now we have a pissed off fag who wants to kill 
someone.  I believe if you kill someone, immediate death.  If I am
not mistaken, this is called an eye for an eye, and it seems to apply
to every other part of human life, why not crime?  Because for some
reason or another, the judicial system caters to the needs of
the criminals...  WHY?

        "...punishes lawbreakers..."
        Now what does this say?  It says that these people who are
corrupt and racist bigots who run courts, are also the ones who
decide what you can do for the next few (or many) years of your 
life.  If you get framed for a murder, you get death most of the
time.  There are people who get thrown in jail that are not guilty.
People will argue with me that what the judge/jury decides if the
person is guilty or not, and that decision is the truth, but I 
disagree.  There was recently a person that was released from jail
after 5 years of being falsely accused and jailed for something 
HE DIDN'T DO!  Is that what the judicial system was made to do?  To
jail as many people as possible?  What do you say to a person you
convicted of murder 5 years ago, who was just proven innocent of
it because of new evidence?  "Oh, gee guy...  I'm really sorry
about that..."  Judges are too old fashioned, as I said before.
They base their rulings on the rulings of courts before their time.
They base them on rulings of courts that handled cases that are
similar, but NOT EXACT to this one.  Example [did not actually
happen to my knowledge] : 1950.  Some man is accused of killing his 
wife, daughter and his daughters friend.  Released because the
jury ruled in his favor.  1995.  Some man kills his wife, daughter
and his daughters friend.  Released because of earlier decision,
and a good lawyer.  What are lawyers but people who are capable
of taking lies and turning them into truths??  

        Now, enough with the definition, now it's time for me to
really bitch about this branch of government that controls the future
of any person accused of a crime, which I might add, is a large
number...

        Lets see, if the system was made to judge how to punish
lawbreakers and to decide if, indeed, a law is broken, then how
come basically, they accept bribes?  Let me explain a little more.
The Sixth Amendment says that you have the right to counsel, but
if you look guilty, and you can't afford a good lawyer, you're
convicted IMMEDIATELY.  The counsel that the court provides is not
something that you want to deal with.  They just want to get out 
of that courtroom and go home.  They don't get paid much, and don't
win most of their cases.  Now, if you want to win a case that makes
you look guilty, you must give lots of money to a good lawyer.  Look
at O.J.  He has paid millions for these lawyers who, I bet you, 
will get him acquitted.  That doesn't mean O.J. did it, it doesn't 
mean he didn't do it.  Lets say that a man kills a security guard,
and I walk up behind him, and try to help the guard and no one else
sees me do it?  *I* get charged for the murder.  All the evidence
points DIRECTLY to me.  I have the guards blood all over my hands.  
That is evidence enough for any jury.  Now, I didn't kill that
guard, but I'm guilty... What does that say about the judicial
system?  It says that the judicial system bases it's findings on
what they can see, and don't dig any deeper.  Would you like to know
why?  It's human nature not to give a rat's ass about someone else. 
That is just how it goes, and no one can change that.  But it's
that underlying fact that makes everything so corrupt.

        I think that's all that can really be said about the
judicial branch of government, but let me leave you with this:
The system of government that judges you, and all the other
people in the U.S.A. is a dangerous group of people.  They have
too much power, no matter what the rest of the government thinks.
No other branch can say "You're guilty, go to jail, do not pass
go, do not collect $200, do not get out for 29 years."  That is
too much power.  Congress can decide what laws are to be made, 
but if the judicial branch doesn't like them, they can cancel
them at any time.  The President only has the power to elect 
who goes into the Supreme Court, but look what happened to 
Clarence Thomas.  My bet is that the Supreme Court (which, mind
you, is filled with racist bigots), after getting rid of
that great mind Thurgood Marshall (who was black), wanted to
keep it white, they dug up some info on Thomas, and tried to
get him out of it.  Look at all the pictures of the new Supreme
Court...  Clarence Thomas seems somewhat farther away from 
everyone...  That is all I have to say.
