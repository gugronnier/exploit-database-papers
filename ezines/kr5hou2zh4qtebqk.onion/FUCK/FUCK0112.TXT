                           Respect
                           -------

        The other night my roomate and I were headed to a local bar 
we frequent quite often, and as usual we stopped by a nearby gas station 
so my roomie could get cigarretes. First off, you have to know a little 
more about him, he is 24 years old, but appears a little younger than I 
do. He is totally against the government in every way so he has no driver's 
licence or any form of government paperwork. Occasionally he gets carded 
for cigs so I often buy them for him since I am 21 and have ID. 

        We pull up to the conoco where I frequently gas up and buy food 
during lunch breaks. After a 5 minute wait for the guy behind the counter 
to finish up with a simple purchase I step up and ask for the pack of cigs. 
He grabbed the cigs and looked at me with doubt in his eye and asked me 
"Do you have ID?!". The tone of his voice blatantly said "You are way too 
young and I don't believe you". I showed him my ID and he kinda of nodded 
then asked me "Don't I always card you?".
        "No, you've never carded me before". He came back more rudely with 
"Well, I'm gonna card you everytime". At this point I was really wondering 
why he was copping such an attitude with me for no reason. I had done 
nothing to piss him off(yet), and had just been Joe Customer. This had 
gone a little past him having a bad day or having something against me 
so I asked him "Why are you copping an attitude with me?" 
        Things went downhill from there and I left with the cigs, bitching 
at this guy, and as I walked out of the place he kept flipping me off 
through the window. I plan on talking to their customer service sometime, 
but it doesn't really matter. The point of all this...

        There is a single thing left for people in the 'GenX' age group 
these days.. that single thing is the only thing left for those younger 
than me. Respect. 

        Think of the generations behind us and what they had to deal with, 
and what they left us with. Right now, as we are striving to live with 
bullshit jobs, yuppies are ready to retire after 30 years of an easy 
deskjob, and looking forward to 20 years of easy retirement. Since these 
yuppies are retiring in five or so years, that puts us at age 25 - 30. 
Companies would rather hire people fresh out of college around 21 or 22 
years old. That puts us out of the game basically in most of the job 
market.
        On top of leaving the GenX age range out of potential jobs, these 
same yuppies leave us with over 1.5 trillion dollars in debt while they 
live off savings and mutual funds. Taxes hit us harder and cause our 
standard of living to go down, while theirs stays the same.
        On top of fewer jobs, and a more competitive job market, we get 
to deal with a completely fucked up political system with no bright tunnel 
at the end. On top of having to deal with it, most of us have no desire to 
sink ourselves into the corruption that is prevalent in the system. After 
the political system, we get to deal with the environment since our 
parents have been plundering our resources unmercifully for years.

        Another fun thing we get to deal with is social security. Basically, 
there is not enough money in reserve to pay for my social security when it 
is time for me to collect. With all this bearing down on people my age, we 
have to wonder what is left for our generation?

        Respect. That is the only thing that we can honestly demand from 
anyone else. Not so much pure respect, but at least common courtesy and 
basic respect toward others that haven't wronged you. When someone refuses 
to give you fundamental respect, they are worth absolutely nothing, and 
are meaningless in society. Just like the chimp that I dealt with at the 
gas station, these people are getting to be more and more prevalent in 
today's society.

        I understand if yuppies and older people deny us any respect, but 
from one GenX'er to another, that should be the one thing you are willing 
to show since we have nothing else. The other thing to remember, is if you 
deny someone respect, and that is the only thing left, be prepared to 
suffer any consequences for doing so. If you show someone that it is a cruel
world, and you don't give a shit, they may show it back in other ways.
