                            St00pid Thangs Part 2
                            ---------------------

        This is a compilation of great things people have said
in retail stores. Until recently, I worked in a couple of computer
stores and constantly dealt with the following types of questions. 
Needless to say, I almost lost my job due to laughing at people
several times. Some of these were collected by Demonika who also
gets the pleasure of detailing with chimps and morons.



"Do you have Nokia battery destroyers?"
-Wonder if they meant battery eliminators? Maybe I should have offered
 them the use of the store trash compactor.

"Does Toshiba have anything to do with Packard Bell?"
-You know how Toshiba and Packard Bell both sound like Japanese 
 companies

"I'm looking for a double speed modem"
-On top of that, this guy insisted for 10 minutes that his terminology
 was right.

"Can I just buy a CPU.? Do I need the monitor?"
-Uh yeah, just jack into the vga port with your hand.

-Talking about viewing gif files..
-"Do I need a video card or something?"

-Talking about AOL service
-"Im on the internet" .. "getting gifs"
-AOL is the internet now?

-Talking about Memory Upgrades
-"I have 4 'ARE AYE EMMs' on my mainframe"

-Wanting to return a set of speakers..
-"Well, I didn't know my car had speakers"

"What kind of video card do you have?"
"Sound Blaster 16"

-This lady knew enough about computers to call a 3.5 disk a 'floppy'
 but needed to ask:
-"Can I save stuff on a floppy?"

Guy who NEVER used windows in his 12 years of computer use..
"Can I get to dos from windows?"

Person holds up a car adaptor for a cell phone, with the lighter plug
up and says: "I can't fit this into my cell phone"

=-=

Demonika had a great time with these:

Man - "I bought my phone (cell) from your store, got service on it
        and now I have it at home. What I was wondering was 'can I 
        just turn it on and use it now? What do I have to do?'"
Dem- "Sir, of course, you have service, therefore you can use the phone."
Man- "But how do I do that? Do I talk to it? Do I have to press any buttons
     or anything?"
Dem- "Yup, you have to turn it on, put the number in you want to call and
        press send."
Man- (excitedly) "Oh thank you so much, I had no idea how to do it!"


A woman comes up brandishing a power extension cord in her hand.
Her- "I was told to buy an extension cord for my modem, but I have no
     idea where to plug it in"
Dem- "Is your modem outside or inside your computer?"
Her- She points to a packard bell and states "I have one of those."
Dem- "You have no need of a power extension cord"
Her- "How do I plug it in?"
Dem- "Use your phone jack, you need a phone extension cord!"
From here she couldn't comprehend what to do, what a modem was for, etc.
She had to be shown where to plug the phone line into on the back of 
her computer, and she still didn't realize this was a 'phone/modem'.
