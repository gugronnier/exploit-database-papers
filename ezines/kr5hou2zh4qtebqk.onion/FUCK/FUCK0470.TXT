                             Content
                             -------

There are some that have been involved with F.U.C.K. since the very first
days, then there are some that have just begun to get involved.  And it is
those that have been involved with F.U.C.K. over the years, that have written
past files, regarding the changes that they have seen in F.U.C.K. or maybe
they thought it was themselves ... there's a reason for that.

Change is a part of life.  But, also what shapes F.U.C.K. what the people, us
send in and write about ... if we want something with more content and not
read articles about different things, then we should write more.  Instead of
just complaining or giving their piece of mind on the subject and changes,
try to work towards it being the way it's meant to be in your mind.  Anyone
that thinks that F.U.C.K. has changed, is right.  All you have to do is go
back and re-read the very first file release, which explains WHAT F.U.C.K. IS
to know that it has really changed over the hundreds of files released.  Some
of the change noticed is most likely changes within ourselves, and some from
just the rotation of different writers.  But, there is another reason, and
that's the lack of feedback on its content.  How can someone shape something
or mold something without any feedback, or taking a step back and really
looking at how things have become?  If you don't like the changes that have
occurred, then DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT.

File subjects you get sick of, then give something that would make the ones
you don't like look less and less favorable - and slowly I am sure you would
see less and less of those types of files.  IF you give feedback about it,
and not just complain about it -or- write one file about how things have
changed, and disappear for months on end ...

We, the writers are the ones that submit to Dis what he can choose to put in
F.U.C.K. and we, the writers are the ones that ask about when the next issue
is going to be out ... and we, the writers, are the ones that have more
ability to get things we may want to read more about in F.U.C.K.

I've read occasional files from F.U.C.K. a long while before I went to the
web and looked up all the back issues and read them, and it wasn't until I
carefully read through all of the releases and went back and re-re-read the
original explanation of what F.U.C.K. is about and for, did I really realize
that I wanted to be apart of it.  Something that sends out things to help
get people to think, and where you can write about what you are thinking
about, dealing with, or what  you really think of the world - and find out
that you aren't alone in it.

A new definition of F.U.C.K. would have to be found within the current state
of how it is ... but also found must be what it wants to be ... what Dis
wants it to be, and then through that, you get what content, you should have
in it.  And, through feedback and submissions you'll eventually get what
F.U.C.K. is all about and should be about ... taking time, to let your voice
be heard, in a place where you'll be listened, within a world that usually
only echoes nothingness.
