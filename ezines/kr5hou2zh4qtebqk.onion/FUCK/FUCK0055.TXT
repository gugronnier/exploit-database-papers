                               Equal Rights
                               ------------

        All (wo)men are created equal! Go ahead and say it! Go ahead
and wipe out that gender gap. Lets make it so men and women are 100%
equal so we can shut some of these bitches up.

        I think I see it almost twice a week now. Somewhere, in some
area of the country, some woman is trying to press on in the endless
battle to guarantee equal rights. Long ago it was voting, now it 
everything else from congress to the fucking boy scouts.
        Our government, and any other position of power has long
been dominated by men. Seldom do you see a woman in charge and that
just makes a few women mad. Hundreds of organizations close their doors
to females based on tradition. 
        Government. What is the basis of our system? Voting. You vote
to see who is in charge. The majority of the people win and put who
they want on the little throne of power. Now think about it. It is close
to a 50/50 split population wise, when it comes to male/female. So
if some lady wants to run for some office, and she runs against a male
opponent, and the guy wins, who is to blame? All the men for being
narrow minded? Or is it all the women who didn't get off their fat
asses and go to the voting booths?
        Lets take one for example. The Boy Scouts. I think the name 
alone would tell you who belongs and who doesn't. Can't really bitch 
because there is a Girl Scout organization but that just isn't good
enough. Back a few years, some bitch took the Boy Scouts of America(BSA)
to court because she wasn't allowed to join a troop. A big legal battle
took place, and honestly, I don't know how it ended up. I do know it 
probably got shot down, and the BSA didn't have to allow her in, or
at least that is what should have happened. Now think a minute. What
would be said if some boy wanted to join the Girl Scouts? First, he
would be turned down. Second, if he tried to take it to court, it 
wouldn't even make it because we all know he is just some little pervert
trying to get into the girl's pants. Nope! Don't say it it different. 
We all know that is exactly what is going through his mind, but that
kind of thought NEVER crossed the girl's mind.
        Last thing. Why don't you ever see any of these ladies pushing        
for a change in the draft? If some war breaks out, and the U.S. decides
to re-instate the draft, why is it that only men get drafted?

        All men are created equal! Once again, this time lets do away
with any racial barriers we have. No matter what skin color, there will
be no discrimination! 

        Hmmm. What is wrong with this picture? First, I am totally
against the KKK and other white supremecy groups, but look around.
There ARE black supremecy groups, maybe they don't get the TV and news
coverage as the white groups, but they are still out there.
        NAACP. National Association for the Advancement of Colored 
People. Great group to help out the 'colored' people so that they
aren't overlooked. Wait. Ever heard of the NAAWP? Yeah, that is the
group that helps out White People. Huh? Never heard of it? Actually
they exist, but they get a lot of shit. Why though? Same damn thing,
just one little letter difference in the acronym.
        How 'bout the United Negro College Fund. To help those poor
but smart black students get through college. Now what if I applied
for a United Caucasion College Fund. I think several people would
jump on my case, a few groups take me to court, etc. Saying that 
isn't fair, or that it discriminates.
        I think it is about time we cut this shit about discrimination.
Yes it happens. White people discriminate against black. BUT, the same
shit happens from black to white. Reverse discrimination is what it is
called by many.

                               =-=-=

        All people are created equal. Lets not discriminate based on
sexual preference! If you are gay, good for you! Stand up and cheer
and watch as no one beats you down for saying so!

        I have no problem with gay people. As long as they don't
approach me, no prob. BUT, lets take the most popular example of
discrimination against gays. 'Ammendment 2' in Colorado. You may
have heard about it since it was on all the news programs for several
weeks. According to the news the ammendment stated that gay people
would not be discriminated and that doing so would get you into 
deep shit or something like that.
        Wait a sec. Since I kinda live here, and I kinda voted on
it, I have to clear up something. The ammendment did NOT say that 
at all. The ammendment was set up to provide rights ABOVE and BEYOND
what is provided for everyone else. So basically gay people would be
given more rights than hetero-sexuals. Hmm. I voted no on it, and I
would do it again in a second. Sure, let them have equal rights,
but to hell with them getting more than I do. Just isn't fair really.

                               =-=-=

        I am not about to go into religious discrimination. That
will no doubt be in another file down the road by someone else.

        Anyway, I think you get the point, and if not then give up and
go shoot yourself or something.
