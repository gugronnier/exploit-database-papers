        File 300!#@! Bonus!

        After 4 years, 63 days, 8 hours, 14 minutes, and 33 seconds...
We finally made it. Why is this such a big goal? Because only two other
online zines of this style made it this far (cDc and uXu)? Because it is
a fuckload of writing. Because the sky is blue. You pick a reason. :)

        Below is a list of the writers, how many files they have
written, and if they are currently active. Along with that are some
somewhat inside jokes for their 'positions'. Nothing personal, just
fun and games or something from past conversation or whatever else.

        I want to also encourage you to write in with any comments
about any of the issues we release. Do not limit yourself to only
positive feedback either. If you disagree with a file or think it has
problems, let me know. I always forward on the original mail to the
author but will keep it anonymous if you want. Just let the writers
know how they are doing.

                                =-=

        I would like to take the time to say 'thanks' again to all
the people who are writing for the zine. Every contribution makes
our voice a little louder and more diverse. Keep up the kick-ass
work. I'd also like to go a little further out of the way and say thanks
to a few people in paticular. Please don't interpret this as favoritism
or anything, I like all you fuckers just the same.

        Legion and Voyager: For taking the big step and spilling the
whole pot of beans to the world. Those kinds of files startle people
more than any others because of how personal they are, and how much
they share.

        Demonika: For continually giving me a sanity check along the
way as well as a healthy dose of spelling and grammar. Hopefully
we will continue to see more of your writing.

        se7en: For taking the time out of a busy schedule and writing
what is exactly on your mind. I think you give the zine a good portion
of that 'daily reality' feeling.

        GNN and Mogel: For writing in the first place. I know how hard
it is to meet your own deadlines for your own zines, let alone write
for others. My article for uXu is almost done (I know, I keep saying
that), but hopefully it will be worth the wait.

        So there it is. More years to come, more experiences to write
about, a lot more things to dislike, and then some.
