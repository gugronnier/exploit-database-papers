                             Four Zero Zero
                             --------------

        Seems like this 100th file came much quicker than the last.
Time has certainly flown by in the real world. At any given point
in time, it seems as though you can measure how much change there is
in your life. This figure is based off your perception of the change,
coupled with what you remember to have changed. Of course, this isn't
accurate by any means, but accuracy is nothing, perception is everything.

        I received a file submission the other day that wasn't completed
according to the author. I personally think it could have been released
as is, but she felt differently. One thing that stood out about this
article was the intense writing style, coupled with the fact that she
has been reading the zine for most of its life. As her file points out,
she knows the 'old' me, the more bitter and outspoken me. The me that
wasn't afraid to tell people how I felt. That file made me think quite
a bit about the zine and where it is today.
        That author writes "even fuck has taken on a new face.  once
a critic of Life itself, is now but a medium of rants and raves.  few
palpable pieces stay true to the past.  the unspoken ideal.  the
intellectual ramblings of fucked up souls who had more to criticize than
religion and relationships. whatever happened to those?"
        Have things changed that much? Have we the writers moved on to take
on new perspectives? Or have we maybe refined our writing style aiming
to be more verbose and try to make every word count? I don't know. I do
know that I will be re-reading some of the early issues in an attempt
to find out what was lost. Has the style changed while leaving the
message behind? Or have we lost some of the message? It is obvious
that some things have changed as new writers join the zine and others
move on. Since it has been over two years since I have been in college,
more of the writers I find seem to be in the working world rather than
school. Has that made a significant difference?
        I have been on a steady downward spiral myself. Going from
48 to 29 to 19 to 9 files written out of each 100. Moving from 48%
to 9% is a significant change, and a very likely reason behind the
perception of change. Sitting on this drive are about fifteen
unfinished files, some sitting there from over a year ago. Beyond that
are twenty files with material that could easily be used for other
files. I have seven unfinished pieces by Voyager, while Demonika sits
on sixteen unreleased files. We are all very passionate about certain
things, and all like to express our views. So why do they sit there
uncompleted? Who knows.
        The material is there, the time isn't. One thing all writers
like to see is feedback on their material. That is one thing that has
gotten better over the years. More people are taking the time to write
and tell how they feel about the files. Regardless of opinion, if you
have the time to respond, please do.

        Where is the world today. That is one little thing that probably
affects us all to some degree or another. Some people say things are
still going downhill, that crime is worse, pollution worse, society
as a whole worse. Others can counter those claims with statistics to
show that crime is actually going down, that the rate of increase for
pollution decreased, and that society is getting better overall. Bah,
fuck it all. None of them will be a real concern in my lifetime, at
least not in the long run.
        The internet is the new global means for communication. Every
day thousands of people flock to the net to jump on the great hype.
As they do, they bring new cultures, new stories, and new experiences
with them. Unfortunately they also come with sheer stupidity and annoyance.
Like before, certain online services seem to cater to these morons, but
they can be found on just about any service. Should the veterans of the
net stop to help them? I don't think so. Experience tells me that it is
a waste of time. In less than six months, my mother has gone from being
scared of computers, to owning a new Pentium Pro, uses dialup ISDN to
connect to one of her two ISPs, and effectively uses the web to access
information. No offense to her, but if she can do it, anyone can.
        The battle for online privacy continues. Congress still wants
to backdoor all forms of strong encryption, make it possible for various
federal agencies to quickly tap any phone line with little or no
authorization, as well as censor the content of sites to a certain degree.
What the fuck? The supreme court ruled against the Communications
Decency Act.. it was unconstitutional. The DEA is currently filing suit
against the CIA and NSA attempting to make it illegal for either agency
to tap *any* phone, because both agencies were actively listening in
on DEA conversation. What does that tell you? That the government is still
full of clueless windbags that are interested in serving their own
delusional senses of right and wrong. These dumbfucks need to be thrown
back into society (or jail), not be allowed to control our lives.
        We still pay gobs of money in federal taxes while multi-million
dollar corporations get tax breaks, form quasi-monopolies that are overlooked
by the Justice Department, and the regular man lives in fear of a tax
audit. The regular man walks down the street in fear of being mugged or
beaten down for no other reason than the attacker's enjoyment. Fear
seems to be a common emotion these days. Instead of technology advancing
in all areas, it seems to be heading more toward convenience still. Why
haven't cars advanced as much as computers? Compare a car ten years ago
to a computer ten years ago. That is pathetic.

        The bright side of all this you ask? Increased costs for everything,
no government funding when you grow old, the chance of dying for your
wallet with no cash in it, the chance of dealing with the million types
of fraud that can cause your life to be hell. If you're really lucky,
you might get to enjoy a fucking barbecue with your family or friends
on a sunday. Yay.
        What does that mean? Enjoy any aspect of your life when you can.
If you see a chance to do something you MIGHT enjoy, just fucking do it.
Deal with the consequences later. Temporarily forget about ethics or
morals, there is no right or wrong. There are inadequate words to describe
complex ethical situations set forth by a society that doesn't have a
clue. So try it. Whatever it is. See if you can find some kind of enjoyment
in your life. New hobby, slashing someone's tires, different sexual
preference, what ever floats your boat.

        That's it. No cheerful ending to a bleak outlook on life and society.
That's exactly what I see right now, and nothing will change it by the time
I am done with this file. As I stated above, I do like feedback, but let
me qualify that. If you reply to my files, don't tell me to "cheer up",
"be happy", "think happy thoughts", or any shit like that. That isn't me.
It never has been. I'm tired of pretending I think that way. Doom and
gloom is just fine with me. Crime and chaos is a good thing. You don't
agree? Go be part of the cause of it and you will feel differently about
it. The world is NOT happy. Crime DOES pay. Anyone who tells you differently
has their eyes closed or is trying to sell you something.

        Oh, one last thing. Your god still doesn't exist. No matter what
god or goddess it may be. To think otherwise is foolish.
