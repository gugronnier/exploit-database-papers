                        The Symbolic Nipple
                        -------------------

	Every year governments all over the world spend hundreds of millions
of dollars on anti-smoking campaigns in an effort to convince people of the
fact that smoking is a major health hazard.  In these campaigns they usually
show the black stained lungs or the gruesome tumors of heavy smokers.  And
still, in spite of the aggressive approach, an incredible number of people
are inhaling the carcinogens contained by tobacco day after day.  At first
one could say that ignorance of the hazards contributed to the large tobacco
consumption, but nowadays every smoker or non-smoker knows how dangerous
smoking is.  So one might ask: "Why are millions of people putting their
health at stake for such a stupid habit?" Opinions diverge on this matter.
Some people think nicotine is the one responsible, but the poor result of
nicotine Band-Aids proves that we have to look elsewhere.  The psychological
addiction seems the most obvious, but what exactly is the psychological
process behind this habit?
	Again various hypotheses exist, but one in particular stands out.
It's the explanation put forth by Desmond Morris, a famous British
anthropologist.  In his book Intimate Behaviour he says about cigarettes:

"...having something between the lips is a comforting experience for the 
human animal, since it spells reassuring contact with the primary 
protector, the mother.(...)The object [cigarette] feels soft between the
lips and the smoke warms it, which makes it even more like the genuine 
mother's nipple than a rubber dummy.  Furthermore, the sensation of 
something being sucked out of the end of it and drawn down the throat 
adds to the illusion.  A new symbolic equation is set up: warm inhaled 
smoke equals mother's warm milk." (Morris 1971) 

        At first Morris' approach may seem a little far fetched, but if
one starts thinking about it another conclusion might be reached.  Is it
a coincidence that people usually smoke in stressful situations or at
parties, where they could sure use a comforting and reassuring nibble at
their mother's nipple?  Is it a coincidence that the actual smoke of a
cigarette has very little biological effect, but that in practice it is
often as soothing as a dummy for a crying infant?  In fact many more clues
point to the correctness of Morris' theory and as Freudian and far fetched
as it may seem, it deserves consideration.  It is a known fact that
consuming lollipops and chewing gum are often good ways to keep yourself
from smoking.  Again, is it a coincidence?
	If more research is done into Morris' theory there is a good chance
that substitutes of smoking will be found that are socially more acceptable
than sucking a baby's dummy or a lollipop.  These new substitutes will
incline more and more smokers to switch from their unhealthy habit to a
soothing but harmless form.  If adolescents are made aware of the
alternatives they will probably prefer the harmless form over the unhealthy
smoking and in this way these new substitutes will even prevent people from
starting to smoke.
	The ineffectiveness of traditional campaigning has proved that a new
approach is needed and it's clear that we must do more research in the
psychology of smoking instead of going around slapping smokers' hands.  So,
until there is a better alternative, every time you feel the need of a
cigarette just take a lollipop from your pocket and nibble away!
