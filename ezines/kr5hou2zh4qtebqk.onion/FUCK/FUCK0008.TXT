                         Journalism at its Finest
                         ------------------------

     Bah. I say that to journalism when I read some of the shit they print
and expect us to believe. In this case I have no doubt that 90% of who
read the following article believed it. They don't know better, but a few
of us who know the guys and actually took interest in what the hell really
happened know that this article is complete bullshit. This was printed in
the Texas Tech UD which is ditributed campus-wide and is basically free to
the students. Read it through real quick.

                   TWO TECH SOPHOMORES FACING FRAUD CHARGES
 
Two Texas Tech Students face federal and state prosecution and a former Tech   
student faces federal charges for computer fraud after the Secret Service 
confiscated $5,000 of computer equipment and $20,000 of software Dec.15 on 
the second floor of Sneed Hall.
    Tech's Housing and Dining Services requested that one of the suspects 
move out of Sneed Hall because of rule violations detailed in the residence 
hall contract, Housing and Dining Director James Burkhalter said.
    According to the contract, the University reserves the right to cancel
the contract when a student "disrupts the orderly administration and 
function of the university and any of its activities."
    "Any violation of the Code of Student Conduct and the housing policies
require that the students face either a residence hall disciplinary   
committee or a university committee," Assistand Director of Housing and 
Dining Services LeQuice Lancaster said. "The hearings determine whether 
the students  have behaved in a manner which requires removal from the 
residence hall."
    Secret Service Agent Dave Freriks said, "Computer fraud is going  to 
become  major target for government law enforcement.  Although this was not a 
big raid for the Secret Service, it was signifigant for the west texas area.
    Computer fraud costs software companies about $500 million per year, 
Freriks said.  A signifigant portion of computer hacking occurs at 
universities because students have time to work on computers and have access 
to computer networks, he said.
    "This problem is quite prevalent on university campuses." Freriks said. 
"In this case, the students just wanted the games and the progrms and couldn't 
afford them."
    The Secret Service investigation began in May when Tech's academic 
computing services could not use the computer system' disks because they were 
full.
    The two 21-year-old sophomores accessed Tech's mainframe computer by using 
account numbers giving to them by the Tech Library.  The mainframe 
electronically transmitted a  worldwide computer bulletin board that was used 
to request and receive pirated computer programs.
    The former Tech student used a campus organization's computer access code 
to enter the Tech system, said University News and Publications Assistant 
Director Steve Kauffman.
    The former student confessed to pirating $6,000 worth of software during 
summer 1992.  He was expelled in July for misusing the Tech computer system.
    The students also used the computer to contact people in Belguim, 
Australia, and Israel, Freriks said. The students probably have been breaking 
into the computer system since Nov.1991, he said.
    According to "Computers, the Law, and You." an academic Computng Services 
publication, students are expected to use Tech computers ethically. Tech 
reserves the right to  monitor all accounts to ensure the software and 
computer equipment are used properly.
    Copying , adapting, and electronically transmitting computer software if 
forbidden unless the purpose of the copies is archival, or the copier receives 
written permission from the copyright  holder, the publication states.
    "Many network resources are provided by the U.S. Government," the 
publication states."Abuse of the system thus becomes a federal matter above 
and beyond simple professional ethics."


ARTICLE TITLE: TWO TECH SOPHOMORES FACING FRAUD CHARGES
ARTICLE AUTHOR: SANDRA PULLEY
PUBLICATION: UNIVERSITY DAILY
DATE: THURSDAY, JANURARY 21, 1993

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

        Ok. Harmless enough right? Well, one of the two sophomores they
are talking about sorta wrote an article in response to it. He simply 
points out some of the mistakes of the article and corrects a few facts
that were wrong. Read his reply.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Dear Editor:

     I am writing in response to a front page article on
Jan. 21 titled "Two Tech Sophomores Facing Fraud Charges,"
written by Sandra Pulley.  It disturbs me as to where some of
Ms. Pulley's fact originate from.
     Ms. Pulley says that "the Secret Service confiscated
$5000 of computer equipment and $20,000 of software Dec. 15
on the second floor of Sneed Hall."  First of all, the raid
occurred on Monday, December 14th, not the 15th.  Also, U.S.
Department of the Treasury, Secret Service Resident Agent R.
David Freriks said at the Dec. 15th press conference in the
Lubbock Federal Building, that a dollar amount could not be
placed on the confiscated equipment, the value of the
software found, nor the actual loss to the software
manufacturers.  The Texas Tech Department for Police Services
released a dollar amount of $3000 for the equipment
confiscated.  No dollar amount has been released for the
value of the software, nor the loss to the software
manufactures by any source other than the University Daily in
the mentioned article.  Also, all of the confiscations from
the room in Sneed Hall were handled by the Texas Tech Police,
not the Secret Service as stated in the article.
    Farther down in the article Housing and Dining Assistant
Director LeQuice Lasater is quoted as saying, "`Any violation
of the Code of Student Conduct and the housing policies
require [sic] that a student face either a residence hall
disciplinary hearing committee or a university committee.'"
The student that was "requested to move out of Sneed Hall"
was not given a hearing of any kind, so far, and was not
"requested" to leave; his contract with Housing and Dining
was terminated and he was given 72 hours to move off campus.
    The article states that the students received account
numbers from the Tech Library.  Granted that the Advanced
Technology Learning Center (ATLC) is housed below the
library, but they are an individual entity, not a part of the
library.  There are several other inaccuracies in the said
article, but since the other mistakes were also made in the
Associated Press story, according to the Houston Chronicle's
Special Projects writer, Joe Abernathy, I will not bore you
with the details.
     I do not mean to attack Sandra Pulley's abilities as a
news writer, I just want her and the other UD writers to be a
little more accurate and careful with their facts.
 
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

        Ok. Simple, to the point, and factual. No prob right? Well, the
UD decided it wouldn't print that for the following reasons according
to the person who wrote the response to the article.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

They refused the letter because I spent too much space "attacking the writer" 
and not enough "dealing with the facts" that were released in the article...

Pardon me, but I did not put one bit of personal knowledge, I wrote that 
letter from the AP wire report, the press conference transcript, and the press 
releases from the school...   (the same sources a reporter should use!!!)  and 
I never used the numbers and facts that the prosecuting attorney have, or 
those that my lawyer and I have estimated...  those are for private ears 
only...    so I am kinda suspicious that the UD is afraid that I might ruin 
the credibility of an up and coming journalist...  looks to me that maybe she 
has no credibility to be ruined...

    In the journalists defence, she swears up and down that Freriks gave her 
those numbers, but he says he has given no information out, except at the 
press conferenc and the official press releases...   so I am still 
wondering....

----------------------------------------------------------------------------- 

        Ok. You ask why the hell I am writing this file? It is one word 
against the other? Hmm. Don't think so. I think that the reporter just 
needed an article and printed what s/he could to get it in on time and
didn't bother too much with facts. If that is the case then you need to 
think about other papers. These college reporters are the ones that later
grow up and write for the bigger papers, the shit your parents read. Now
if those papers are full of people that don't bother with the facts too much
then we have a serious problem. The paper wouldn't print the letter to the
editor. Why? He is right. They are scared of getting a bad name. But why
does it matter? It is a free paper and students will read it regardless of
reputation most likely.
        It all begins here. Point of this file is to make you realize that
newspapers and TV news shows might not be as factual as you think. They are
just as biased as the people that write for them. Think about what you read
and hear from them, and do NOT take things for fact all the time. 

                                                -Dam

PS- We are behind you..."sophomores".
