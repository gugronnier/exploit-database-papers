		Intimidated By The Sun
                ----------------------


Why moon goddess?

Why does the sun intimidate you? Why do you hide from its
rays in its relative anonymity? Why sister of the planet
Earth, do you hide behind cloaks of darkness?

Yes, it does hurt. But everything hurts doesn't it Moon
Goddess? Pain is everywhere, it's not central to a specific
being. You feel the pain it feels, everywhere.

The rays might hit you different then others, in a little
less darkness then before. Perhaps that mirror is casting
some more light into your eyes. One can't be too sure what
exactly they are seeing, maybe they aren't seeing, maybe
they are believing.

Believe in me Moon Goddess.

They cast upon the Earth.. shimmering on the lakes.. But
that gives no comfort in the empty vacuum that you know.

You ponder the meaning of this light.. What does light
have to do with the darkness you know? What are you 
contemplating? Why is the pinpoint of blackness inside
of your soul reaching out and manifesting into the physical
dimension?

Why have you lost your soul?

There is a darkness in your eye that is pondered not today.

Your way of thinking astounds me.. Your kindness floods
over me.. But the blackness in your eyes is frightening..

Your heart is a million miles away.

You can't kill the Moon Goddess, she's death itself.

Your sigh blows out the candle that is your life.. and
you drift away.. slowly..
