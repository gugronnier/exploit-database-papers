                           Fortune Cookies
                           ---------------

I just returned from a long trip to Cocoa Beach, Florida and had a hell of
a lot of fun while I was there. Yet, the one thing which stuck in my mind
was the consistently horrible food wherever we went. Getting silly over
drinks and conversation in a Chinese restaurant last night, we tormented
our waitress into giving us a ton of fortune cookies to kill the taste of
the meager food. My ten, with my drunken comments to each one, are below:


Good advice jars the ear.

...But loud music is better.

You simplify your life in many ways and find great rewards.

...A lot less bullshit to deal with.

Be mischievous and you will not be lonesome.

...But you'll have too many idiots surrounding you.

All happiness is in the mind.

...Kind of like when you're sick, "It's all in the mind."

You'll advance far with your abilities.

...Still treading!

When you give something away, it makes room for something new.

...I would have preferred "thrown away" over "give away."

A romantic evening at home is the best way to relax.

...And I always thought sleeping was the best way to relax.

No harm in putting all your eggs in one basket - just watch it closely.

...Some fucker is always looking to steal them.

Many a false step is made by standing still.

...But at least you don't get run over by cars.

Approach the future with an optimistic smile.

...I prefer an evil grin.
