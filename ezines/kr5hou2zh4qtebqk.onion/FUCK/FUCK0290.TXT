                         Fortunato's Logic
                         -----------------

When I think back to the injustice they served me,
Only rage and sadness come to my heart and mind.
What they did to me is inexcusable and can only be met with vengeance,
But not the kind that fast and painless,
That would be too easy.

What I plan to do them is so ingenious, so vile, and so simple.
I will show them that I am not one to be toyed with.
And that when my vengeance unfolds I will prove that they are nothing more, 
Nothing more than hypocritical, two-faced, and above all simple minded. Which 
will hurt more than a bullet ever would.

It enrages me to know that they have gotten away,
Away with this injustice against me.
It also angers me to know that they have gotten away with this injustice,
For so long and no one has noticed.
But that will all change.
 
I am not insane, but after being abused by their "sense of humor" all these
years, Who would be?
No, I am just fed up with them and their actions and I am going to deal with
them, In a way that will harm only the two thing they hold dear,
Their pride and their pity will be destroyed.

See I know I am not insane,
Because insane people do not think, they act.
And I think before I act, so I am not crazy.. just smart.
Another fact is crazy people are locked up for a reason,
And they are forced to wear a white dinner jacket for a reason.
When my revenge unfolds they will be locked up,
And they will be forced to wear white dinner jackets.

You see I am justified in my vendetta against them,
For I have bore there insults and been the brunt of their jokes.
So vengeance is mine alone,
And I will carry it.
What fun I shall have when it is done.

Even though my plan for revenge are expertly laid out there is a problem,
For without it I could be well on my to what is mine.
I am sort of embarrassed to talk about this small problem, But it must be
said to help me carry it out. Could you please remove my straight jacket!
