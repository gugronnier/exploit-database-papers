"Life without a beneficial purpose is empty existence. You ask me
what is a beneficial purpose? It is one that counters the progression 
of entropy in the universe."
                                     - The Eyes of the Beholders                                              
                                            A.C. Crispin

Anticipation of death is worse than death itself.

In the elements world; fire well used-warmed/ill used-burned.

A prophecy implies we are destined to do something. It dictates to
us, we have no choice in the matter. It robs us of our freedom of 
will. Too often, prophecies end up being self-fulfilling. Once the 
thought is in our minds, we act, either consciously or unconsciously, 
to bring it to pass. That can be the only explanation....unless 
you believe in a higher power.
                                  -Fire Sea
                                   Margaret Weis and Tracy Hickman

The universe is not only queerer than we imagine. It's queerer than
we can imagine.                   - Sir Arthur Eddington

The truth is a virus.                 - Pump Up The Volume

The only reason some people get lost in thought is because it's
unfamiliar territory.

"The fear of death keeps us from living, not dying"  - Paul C Roud

"Whether fate be foul or fair, why falter I or fear? What should man
do but dare?"    -Sir Gawain and the Green Knight

Cowards die many times before their deaths; The valiant never die
but once.   -Shakespeare

Treason doth never prosper: What's the reason?
For if it prosper, none dare call it treason.
                                Sir John Harington

"The truth is always a much stronger argument."

"Teaching is the fine art of imparting knowledge without possesing it."

"People who fly into a rage, always have a bad landing."

"The man that has done all he thinks worthwhile has begun to die."

The essence of war is violence.
Moderation in war is imbecility.        - Fisher

Atheism is a non-prophet religion.

Anarchy is the only system fair to all.

If con is the opposite of pro, is congress the opposite of progress?

Till human voices wake us, and we drown.
                                        - T.S. Eliot

The only good is knowledge and the only evil ignorance.
                                        - Socrates

The boast of heraldry, the pomp of power, and all that wealth,
all that beauty e're gave, a wait alike the inevitable how;
the paths of glory lead but to the grave.
                                        - Thomas Gray

Why torture yourself when life will do it for you?

Stupidity cannot be cured with money, or through education, or by legislation.
Stupidity is not a sin, the victim can't help being stupid.  But stupidity is
the only universal capital crime; the sentence is death, there is no appeal,
and execution is carried out automatically and without pity.

The most preposterous notion that homo sapiens has ever dreamed up is that the
Lord God of Creation, Shaper and Ruler of all the Universes, wants the
saccharine adoration of His creatures, can be swayed by their prayers, and
becomes petulant if He does not receive this flattery.  Yet this absurd
fantasy, without a shred of evidence to bolster it, pays all the expenses of
the oldest, largest, and least productive industry in all history.

The greatest productive force is human selfishness.

My life has a superb cast but I can't figure out the plot.
                        Ashleigh Brilliant

There is only one difference between a madman and me. I am not mad.
                         Salvador Dali

When you feel like criticizing the younger generation, just
remember who raised them.

Any fool can criticize, condemn, and complain - and most fools do.

We, the willing, led by the unknowing, are doing the impossible for
the ungrateful. We have done so much for so long with so little, we
are now qualified to do anything with nothing.

Most people miss their calling because they can't hear it over
their complaining.

You can make more friends in two days by becoming interested in
other people than you can in two years by trying to get other
people interested in you.

In spite of the cost of living, it's still popular.

Everyone is trying to accomplish something big, not realizing that
life is made up of little things.

You cannot kindle a fire in another's heart until it is burning in
your own.

Stand for something or you'll fall for anything.

Men of genius are admired; men of wealth are envied; men of power
are feared; but only men of character are trusted.

Do not walk behind me, I may not lead. Do not walk in front of me,
I may not follow. Just walk beside me and be my friend.

Remember, no one can make you feel inferior without your consent.

Be different, act normal.

Rembrandt painted 700 pictures and Americans have all 5,000 of
them.

The scientific theory I like best is that the rings of Saturn are
composed entirely of lost airline luggage.

Ignorance needs no introduction. It always makes itself known.

Why talk but to end the fighting? Why fight but to end the talking?

Many people in one's life can touch their heart,
But few can touch their soul.             - Denise McCay

Of all the base passions, fear is most accursed.

I can endure my own despair, but not another's hope.
                                          - William Walsh

We have just enough religion to make us hate, but not enough
to make us love one another.              - Jonathan Swift
