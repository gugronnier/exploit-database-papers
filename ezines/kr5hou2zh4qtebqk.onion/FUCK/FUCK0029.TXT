        With an audible sigh, the teenager sat back wishing class would 
finally end. It had been over an hour since he sat down, listening to
the endless babble from the figure at the front of the classroom. Right
above the proffesor was a huge clock. Why do they always put the clock
right in front of you, constantly reminding you of how long you had to
wait before leaving. Two more minutes before he was free for the rest
of the afternoon. 'Damn. Nothing ever happens during the last few minutes
of class.' He slumped down in his chair again, wishing the prof would
end the class. Glancing around and back toward the front he mumbled
'One more minute. Nothing happens.'
