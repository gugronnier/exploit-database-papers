                      Every City Loves the Night
                      --------------------------

I've never been to New York (except as a tourist) or Los Angeles (except as
a child), but I think every city loves the night. Austin does. I've been 
here a few years now, and it's best after the sun goes down. 

It's not just the nightlife - which is generally recognized as awesome, but
I don't participate much - it's the life of the night. 

Last night I slammed the door behind me on accident, locked it, then stepped
down the porch into an alley, in West Campus, between 22nd and 22 1/2 Street.
Mostly college kids (mostly fucked up) live in this area. Lately, rich old
people and law firms have been buying real nice houses around here, too. 

I walked to campus, and sat in the grass for awhile. Everyone was gone, and
everything was still. Have you ever felt that stillness? Like everything is
stopped. A moment in time for you to play with. And it makes you kinda sad 
and kinda excited. You have to open your mind to really understand the
beauty of it. 

With me, I sometimes get energized by it and that's when I decided to take
a walk. So I walked straight towards the state capital. I mean, I was walking
with a direction and with such passion that I felt like I was holding my own
little march. It's a straight shot from where I was sitting. 

When I got there I sat on the steps for a rest (i'm so fucking out-of-shape).
Then I headed east, into downtown Austin. They've done a good job with 
downtown, keeping it peaceful, I mean. There are cops on bikes who drive 
around, and patrol cars everywhere. It's clean, too. They have guys that 
hose down the sidewalks every night. 

I walked up 16th until I got to the highway, which I crossed. East Austin is
my favorite neighborhood. A lot of Mexicans and students live out here. It's
Austin's socio-economically poorest area. I went into this coffee shop that I
know and ordered a mocha as I do every night, in true Generation X form. 
I smoked and thought for awhile. 

Outside, I met a friend of mine, and we talked for awhile. But this guy
is such a fucking bore. I toyed with spitting in his face, but didn't. 
He talked about how much he loved his girlfriend and how smart she was. He
said he changed his life, but I doubt it. He used to be hitting every night.
He showed me how to jack-back for the first time. Fucker. 

We parted and I went deeper into the Bario. I met this girl who was 19 and
a single mother. Living off welfare, and searching for a job. She
was a prostitute by night. I declined. I stopped by this apartment because
I heard a party going on inside, and they came out for some fresh. We talked
and they invited me in to smoke some weed. They were sophomores at the
university, and they were hanging this big confederate flag and snorting
coke and hitting hard. 

I left later. Stumbled into an alley and passed out again. 

The night seduces the city. He's smooth, and in control. The night removes 
her inhibitions with ease, and slips into her swiftly. They are joined for
hours, loving, feeling, sexing. In the morning you can smell sex. 

Some nights it gets rough. After the night has had his way with the streets,
he drinks, and becomes violent. The dark fucking beats on you sometimes, man.
Do you feel that? The silence stabs me. 

I do love that first cigarette of the morning, as well.
