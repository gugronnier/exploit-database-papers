           she sat wonderingly, examining the soft crimson teardrops
           welling on her arm. he had kissed her there, so tenderly,
           and her flesh had jumped with the wonderfulness of it.

           she had to erase the pleasure. she had to torture the
           beloved skin, the organic expanse of what should be numb.
           always. she frowned, deep in concentration. she licked her
           lip sensuously, carefully tracing thin lines of agony on
           her arm.

           it was work, a life's work. her body bore a roadmap of
           crisscrossed white scars, coldly reminiscent of the lifeless
           maps of storm torn io, Jupiter's cold moon. careful
           planning and design went into her pain. there was preparation
           involved.

           incense. ashes. a clean cold razor. cold water. tears.
           carefully prepared ingredients, properly mixed with soft
           shuddery music selected for it's aching phrases.

           she pulled the razor across her skin in a methodical rhythm,
           sweeping in time to beethoven. a bead of sweat traveled
           along the line of her chin and dropped into the pool of blood
           breathing on her arm. *a little more over here.*

           now, perfection. he would never want to kiss her there again.
           no one would ever want to love her there again.

           but there was so much more to do.
