            I'd Like to Tell You How I Lost My Religion
            -------------------------------------------

I was raised a Christian by my parents - and believed it. All of it, 
ignoring the misc. contradictions and inconveniences, like most modern-day
Christians. I went to church every Sunday and was active in lots of 
Christian-type stuff at school, too. I cared. I believed. 

Once or twice I even listened to the sermon at church and it *meant* 
something to me. It gave me another outlook on life - kept me going during 
my critical junior-high tenure. 

Then one day I heard that my pastor had had an affair (fucked) another 
member of our congregation. She happened to not be his wife. It had gone 
on for awhile. She was our neighbor. 

Currently, I'm in college and my views have changed. I'm an atheist. Fuck 
that agnosticism crap - it's all a cop out designed to protect yourself
when you die. From what, you ask? Well, an atheist knows that there is 
nothing when you die except death. Blackness. Nothingness - the best fucking
sleep of your life. Can't wait. 

I think Jesus existed, but miracles and supernatural stuff is bullshit. God
never existed. We are a mistake, sadly. Humankind is around to complete a
cycle of birth, life, and death. That cycle is what drives everything. 
Humankind developed from monkeys or dolphins or whatever, now we're humans, 
and soon we will be radioactive waste, and another life form will evolve
(probably cockroach 2.0) continuing the cycle. 

IT'S A SAD FUCKING THOUGHT, EH? 

I can barely believe I wrote that. How fucking depressing. I used to believe
that when we die we go to heaven where we pray all the time and sing and
worship god all day. 

I sure as hell don't want to pray and sing all day all night all the time
- I can barely stand the two hours of church per week. My heaven would be 
freedom. Freedom to fuck in the street, freedom to keep your doors unlocked,
to have a picnic with your friends, to eat a grilled cheese sandwich, to
not eat, to stay up late, to sleep in, without fear of some ominous thing 
happening to you as a result of one of those things. A world without
consequences, that's my heaven!

Mark Twain wrote a book on this subject (and many other subjects) called
"Letters To The Earth". And if you haven't read it - you better haul ass to
the nearest HalfPriceBooks and buy that shit - it is good. "Letters To The 
Earth" had to be delayed - it was illegal to publish it when Twain wrote it. 
Maybe we don't have it so bad after all. 

But there's so much more to do - and the religious people of the world keep
getting in the damn way. 

"The bible says do this, and the bible says to that. blah blah blah."

"Hey sundayschoolteacher, what about what I wanna do, huh, bitch? That's what 
I thought - I cant do what I want to do. Why not?"

"The bible says..." <gunshot>

Anyway, that would suck too, because then we would have everybody out killing
everybody else. Peace and love have to be wanted before they can exist. 
See, religion forces peace and love on to you, all the while you are hating
someone. If people would just learn through experience (evolution) that
peace and love are better and easier and cheaper than fucking hate, then 
we could get rid of our silly, made up religions and concentrate on getting
shit done around here - hopefully delaying the end of our cycle a few years 
more. 

So I was talking to my old pastor the other day, he came to see my new place, 
and we talked about shit and we went to some Mexican restaurant for 
margaritas. Thanks, dad.
