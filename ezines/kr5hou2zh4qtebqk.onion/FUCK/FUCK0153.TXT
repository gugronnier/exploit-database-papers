			    Respectfully Yours
			    ------------------

	As an elitest, I often find myself inwardly scoffing at the 
general public.  After all, I serve the public each and every day
at work.  When you work in a store, dealing with everything from the
dregs of society to the Yuppie elite, you tend to get bitter.  I sell
computers 60 hours a week.  I tech support everything from plugging
in phone lines to editing various autoexec.bats.  I deal with general
stupidity and lack of common sense on a regular basis.  If you have
read the files "Stupid Thangs" you have already gotten an idea of
what I deal with.  Basically, these people have money and they want
Pentiums to play Descent with and get ONLINE with AOL or MSN.  They
go home with powerful tools that will be wasted on their pitiful
computer skills that they will never attempt to develop.

	But I respect these people.  Obviously, if they have the money
to buy Pentium 100's with oodles of RAM, they must be good at something.
As long as they treat me with respect, I feel just fine about sending
them home with these expensive toys.  But more often than not, I
am treated as a lowly corporate peon who is there merely to serve
their whims.  It's amazing to me that I have to carry their HP 540's
to the registers for them, or fetch them a cart when they choose to buy.
Apparantly it's not enough that I have to haul their monitors, printers,
and CPU's down off of a ladder.  Don't they have legs?  I also run into
a lot of trouble because I am female.  "Can I talk to a man?"  "Would
a man know the answer to this question?"  More often than not, it
is a woman requesting the services of a man.

	Then there's the glaring mistreatment I receive regularly.
I explain some policy about returns or exchanges, and they have the
gall to call me a bitch, as if I wrote the policy.  I have been yelled
at for not having an item in stock, told that I am a worthless person
that works at a worthless company, and once I was literally grabbed
by a customer so hard that his grip left bruises.  Now, despite my
general distaste for most people, I would NEVER do such a thing in
anyone elses place of business.  After all, that is their place of work
and I have no right to mistreat them merely because I am unhappy
with something over which they had no control.

	So, my question is, what gives them the right to mistreat me at
my workplace?  Is it because they make more money than me?  Is it
because I *obviously* couldn't be as intelligent as they are since
my salary does not amount to 6 figures?  None of these reasons make
sense for ONE reason.

		       Most of them couldn't do my job.

	My only release from all of this is revenge.  Respectful revenge.
The best revenge is to respectfully point out to these "difficult
customers" exactly how stupid they are without ever saying so directly.
How?  Easy.  
		"YOU SOLD ME A COMPUTER THAT WON'T LET ME GET ON AOL!@#
HOW COULD YOU DO THAT?"
		"Well, ma'am, (I put on my best customer
service smile), did you plug in your modulation/demodulation device?
AOL won't work without one!" (another bright and happy smile to
top of my kindest customer service voice)
		"uhhhhhhhh, no.  What's that?"
		"Well, remember that piece of phone cord that you probably
threw away or left in the box?  Plug it into the wall." (the tone
of my voice exudes helpfulness and sincere wish to be of service)
		"ohhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!  I know what you mean!@#  So sorry 
to trouble you."

	Ms. Customer walks away feeling like an idiot for treating me
like garbage and feels intellectually inferior to boot.

			 God, I love my job.
