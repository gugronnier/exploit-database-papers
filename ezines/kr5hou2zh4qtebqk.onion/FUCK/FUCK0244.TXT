                    Ignorance Is Death of the Society
                    ---------------------------------

    The present state of our country is not very good. All about us swarm
the dirt ignorant, the mindless masses, the sheeple. (i.e. people
controlled by what everyone else is doing, "follow the herd") Ever wonder
how these people got that way? I have.
    In what follows I am going to give you an example of two types of lives..
first, will be the life of a normal person. The second, will be the life of
some computer users. If you haven't already guessed, their is quite a
difference in daily activities between the two groups. But how much?

    The morning of a work-a-day person I assume is quite monotonous. They
wake from a dream that they have a pretty wife, smart kids, and an above
average dog. But alas they wake up and see the wretched face of their
ugly wife, their kids getting ready for school, and their dog chasing its
tail. Stumbling out of bed and into the kitchen they get their cup of coffee
and try to rip themselves out of an unholy sleep. Up late last night
watching the end of Miss America on the idiot box. After swigging down the
black gook without benefit of a cup they head for the shower. After a shower
where the water isn't that warm, but they live with it because they won't pay
the bills, they get themselves ready for work. From 9 AM to 5 PM they sit in
the same seat, in the same office, in the same town. Not trying to learn
anything new, not trying to expand upon their position, sitting there, just
like the rest of the supposed workers in the office. They go home that night
feeling good about themselves. Hell, they have what they always wanted, two
kids with a little under a 3.0 average, a dog, and a wife. This is what they
always wanted.. Right?

     Lets move onto the day of a computer user. My day begins as I lay in bed
and turn on the radio. Immediately, industrial or alternative rock blares
into my ear drums shattering the small fragments of sleep I experienced.
Unlike the herd I did not sit in front of the TV and ponder my toe nails,
I was sitting there thinking, and exploring. My day is spent exploring the
inner crevices of operating systems, expanding upon human intelligence. My
day isn't spent talking to people that have plumbers disease and that have
snot dripping down their face. The day is spent staring at a computer screen
most of the time, learning, thinking. I don't want the American lifestyle.
I want to live by my own rules. I hold a bitter contempt for their lifestyle,
and what it means to me. Rules will not regulate my activities as I yearn to
be free. The only thing I ever really wanted is freedom. Freedom from
corporate enslavement and government America. I don't want mindless children,
nor a half-decent wife, I want the best of anything I can have. I want
choice not decisions made for me.

    I don't know how much emphasis I can put on how important it is not to be
ignorant. You have to constantly expand your mind. Don't fall into the
mindless drones of the herd, be your own person. Be free. Men were not meant
to be slaves. Don't let your days become a bore.. Don't let the only thing
you look forward to in your day be getting the mail and making sure you have
paid the bills. Make the choice to be different. God knows not many of us
are going to be this way forever, (in the words of Blind Melon) so I'm going
to write my words on the face of today.
