                                Fit the Crime
                                -------------

        Every day you hear more and more about violent crimes happening
closer and closer to you, involving more and more people like you or
that you know. Every other day you hear even more about proposed
legislation that will help end all of the violence and make our streets
safe again. Thing is, each and every piece of legislation is idle 
bullshit made to please the citizens, and make it look like some
congressmen are actually doing something. Almost every time this
kind of legislation is brought up it is shot back down.

        Do I have an answer? Of course. Anyone with a third grade
education can come up with several ideas that would end all of this
shit. Will it be effective? Nope. Wouldn't ever go through. Too many
hypocrites living among us for anything to actually get through
congress. First, here is my answer. After that, is why it won't work.

        First topic. Violent crime. Anything deemed violent by
current laws will probably fall under this:

Murder: You take someone's life, and are proved guilty beyond reasonable
        doubt, then your life goes too. None of this bullshit of someone
        killing one, two, three, more people, then pleading insanity
        and serving 10 years. You kill, you are killed.

Rape: Doesn't matter which sex really. Guy rapes woman- He gets raped
      back. Throw him in a prison with documented cases of rape. Who 
      gives a shit about him? Let him get fucked up the ass by some
      other convict in there. Hell, throw all the rapists in the same
      cell and let them see who comes out on top.

Beating: Includes mugging. Simple, you beat someone else down, especially
         for money or some other item of value, then you get beat back
         and lose some money in the process. But we can't just have anyone
         do it, the person who got beat gets to do the beating. Might as
         well let his hate and rage go to good use.

Gang Warfare: Includes gang related murder(killing with no reason, or
              any bullshit reason). You shoot to kill over some lame ass
              color, then you get put in a special prison. There, you are
              forced to wear the color of the gang you are against. Crip?
              Then you wear red all the time. Blood? Wear blue all the 
              time. Flash a gang sign and get the shit kicked out of you
              by guards. Everytime you introduce a new cellmate/loser
              then we get to watch as they go after each other. No parole.

        Other crimes. Some violent some not, and their punishment.

Drugs: Users. Sentenced to one year for using cocaine, heroin, or any
       other drug. During that year you will be put in a room with
       mass quantities of that drug. Pounds and pounds of that drug and
       others. Plenty of pills, needles, joints, and whatnot. Let the
       bastards OD and kill themselves.

       Dealers. I am torn here. Here you have people using their head
       to take advantage of stupid people and profit heavily from it.
       Most American business is like that actually, except most don't
       traffic in illegal substance. If the dealer uses, then the above
       sentence, if not, then confiscation of all weapons, drugs, and
       five or so years.

Child Abusers: Abuse a child, get abused back. Eye for an eye all the way
               with a little more thrown in for the hell of it.

Wife Abusers: Castration.


        I think you get the idea. An eye for an eye is the way it should
be. If you can commit a crime, then you should be ready to accept it as
a victim of that crime would. 

        Now, why wouldn't that work? Because so many people would cry
and bitch that those are 'cruel and unusual' punishments. Excuse me?
What do you call the crime? An eye for an eye is the most fundamentally
fair system this world could achieve. It is probably 75% cheaper than
the current system if not more so and is much more of a deterent than
the current system. 
        With today's system of punishment, convited killers are back on
the street after 20 years and then parole. Doesn't matter that they were
sentenced 45 years, they are out in 20 with good time and other shit.
Same applies to child molesters and other scum out there continually
getting away with all sorts of shit, yet are back on the streets in
a few short years, and sometimes sooner.
        The next thing we need to get rid of is the 'insanity plea'.
Temporary insanity is the biggest loophole, and biggest shitpile this
legal system has come up with. To think you can say you temporarily
lost your mental faculties is so lame yet more and more criminals
are getting out of jail sentences and death penalties with this shit.
        After that we will get rid of is the potential to get out
of a criminal charge because of loopholes in the system. If some clerk
misfiles some paperwork or doesn't file it by a certain date, who gives
a shit, doesn't mean you should be able to get out of a crime. If the
arresting officer makes one mistake or forgets to say one thing, tough
shit, you shouldn't have been doing anything in the first place.

        Death penalty. Why are so many people against it? Maybe it is
just me, but the idea that someone can go out and kill five people,
plead insanity, then get a life sentence without parole is bullshit. 
Why should my tax dollars go to keep him fed, in a decent living
environment, for years and years? There are vietnam vets out there
that took a bullet in war for this country without food or home who
deserve that criminals bed and food much more. Shit, if you ask me,
more vietnam vets and homeless should commit crime. That way they will
start getting a warm meal and a roof over their head.

        Bah. The system will not change much. If it does, it will most
likely be for the worse. Too many whimps across the nation that won't
stand for the punishment system that we so desperately need. Just
use some common sense or maybe even some logic. Thats all.
