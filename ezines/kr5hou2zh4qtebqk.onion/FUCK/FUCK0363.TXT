			 the escher cage
                         ---------------
			journal - 7.22.97
	

	i got the newest fuck file in the mail today.
	number 360. the color of my thoughts quickly
	turned grey as i read about the things that
	d1s had to thank his friends for. i had a
	realization.

	no one can live in your reality with you, no
	matter how much you try to describe it to them.
	analyzing someone else's existence is like
	trying to make sense out of an escher drawing,
	it is simply an impossibility. each one of us
	lives in his own escher cage, and no else can
	truely touch you. they can only guess at the
	solution to the puzzle.

	you might wonder how this file caused me to
	come to this conclusion. well, i admit it was a
	convoluted train of thought. i read the file
	and thought about the things i had to thank
	my friends for, and quickly realized how
	incongruent my experience is to his. he thanks
	his friends for being there for him, for
	helping him, for teaching him about life. i
	have no understanding of his reality because
	my existence is so truly mine. my friendships
	have taught me that i need to fend for myself,
	that trust is there to be shattered, that
	your only constant friend is yourself, and
	that love is often a lie. i cannot understand
	him, and he cannot understand me. you probably
	think that i am just cynical, but that is my
	point. this is the escher cage.

	there are some exceptions. shakespeare
	understood the human experience. there is no
	one on earth who cannot find their own thoughts
	and feelings in at least one line in one play.
	joseph campbell spent his life on unified
	experience. truths can be found in his
	writings as well. and once in a lifetime,
	you just might find the Other, the One Who
	Knows, but i think that this must be rare. i
	won't hold my breath.
