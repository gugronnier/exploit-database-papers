                               Dummies
                               -------

        I was browsing in a bookstore the other day, skimming through
various texts on computers, writing, and other interests of mine,
when I ran across a title that made my blood run cold.

                           _Sex for Dummies_

        Now, the folks at IDG books have been producing their
computer Dummies series with good results and high profit.  Their
original idea was a good one.  After all, there are people required
to do some computer related work that they have no interest in doing
but are nevertheless required to do so by their employer or school.
They are also good introductory texts for people who need the basics
before they get into the meat of the subject matter.  I used to view
these books in the same manner I viewed Cliff's Notes in high school -
a quick outline that gets you going.

        But now they have gone too far.  Curious, I looked through
some other shelves in the store, and was amazed to discover some more
IDG titles.

                         _Job Hunting for Dummies_
                            _Taxes for Dummies_
                             _ISDN for Dummies_
                        _Time Management for Dummies_
                           _Parenting for Dummies_

        This last title made me giggle.  I wondered if you had to buy
_Parenting for Dummies_ if you missed _Sex for Dummies_.  But then I
got serious.  These Dummies books have a subtle impact on the minds
of their readers.  First of all, by purchasing any of these titles,
you are practically shouting from the rooftops that you feel stupid.
That's quite a self-esteem boost.  Secondly, some of these books give
people the impression that anyone can do anything just by reading one
of these "idiot" texts.  As you can see, these titles range from complex
to common sense.  In my mind, it's ont thing to pick up a book about a
simple topic like time management, but something else entirely to use
a similar IDG book for seriuos topics that could impact lives other than
yours. To use these books as a primary reference in this instance could
cause serious security, financial, and personal problems.  Case in point:

        A friend of mine was browsing the computer section of a
bookstore when he was approached by a woman clutching one of these
bright yellow Dummies books.  It was entitled _Unix for Dummies_.  She
asked if he knew a lot about computers, to whch he replied "Sure."
She then proceeded to tell him that she had acquired a job in System
Administration and that she hoped this Dummies book would get her
going.  What she was really saying, without ever using any of these
words, was "HACK ME".  Once this tale had been related to me, I
wondered of her root password was going to be "dummy".

        Now that IDG has expanded their repertoire, covering
everything from mutual funds to parenting, I wonder what these books
are saying about our society in general.  One title in particular
strikes me at this point.

                     _Job Hunting for Dummies_

        If you are so dumb (or lazy) that you can't comprehend the
better texts about resume writing, proper interview techniques, and
contact making, then you shouldn't be buying _Job Hunting for
Dummies_ in the first place. You should pick up an application for
Taco Bell or McDonald's and move on in your life, because you won't
even be able to get a cubicle job at IBM with this book.
Furthermore, our country has reached a sad state if people must
purchase a Dummies book about parenting.  What does this say about
us? That Americans can't even procreate without a book?  That we are
too stupid to comprehend the fundamental (and supposedly instinctive)
basics of parenting?

        Our society has reached a point where we do more reading
about doing than doing, and we can't even use the more detailed
intellectual texts to read about doing.  IDG is capitalizing on this,
and our insecurities about ourselves.  Everything is getting 80's
again.  Quick and dirty, with no  desire for anything to be done
thoroughly, or even well. IDG is saying all of this to us, and, like
the "Dummies" we are, we are falling for it.
