		everything i needed to know i learned in 303
                --------------------------------------------

	- trust no one, even when they say they are your friends.
	- learn when to get into an argument, and when to stay out
	  of one.
	- don't rely on what other people tell you. go to the source.
	- be smart. don't do anything you are uncomfortable with.
	- learn how to use the word no.
	- recognize the signs of social engineering and manipulation.
	- relationships are a waste of time.
	- don't borrow or lend money.
	- be yourself. fuck everyone else and what they think.
	- unix is the only OS. all others are fairly useless.
	- don't waste your time on meaningless friendships or
	  relationships. if it is not working, get out.
	- be honest with yourself, but lie to others when necessary.
	- don't buy cheap stuff. wait till you can afford the best.
	- people steal. don't tell anyone what you have.
	- wear black. it is never out of style.
	- don't back down.
	- never get in the way of boys and their toys.
	- never get in the way of boys and their friends.. the 'buddy'
	  relationship is more sacred than any religion, more bonding than
	  any glue, and men would rather have their friends than anything
	  else in the world.. except maybe toys. (see previous.)
	- buy a used car and you buy a lot of trouble.
	- don't give your hacker friends accounts on your box unless you
	  feel like dealing with administrative headaches.
	- IRC is lame. don't take it seriously.
	- flame wars are best left in /dev/null.
	- pets are expensive but worth it.
	- make sure your landlord lives in the same area that you do.
