			The Rope I Swing On
			-------------------

Ever stop to take a moment in your life to consider who or what
controls you? Who or what is watching over you? What eyes follow
you during the day? What forces mold your world?

I must say for a fact, that I have done so. The answers to my
questions are not positively easy to identify, or universally
shared over a network of people, indeed they are often quite
unnoticable.

You may wonder what it is that I feel controls me, that is the
silent feature that is buzzing in my ear all day long, for the
most part uncontrollable. This feature of life for nearly every
human bieng on this planet, descendant of the apes, is the one
thing nearly all of us feel we cannot live without it.

What is this great evil and also force for good? Look around
you, do you see the computers rays beaming towards your face?
Do you see a dim light casting through the room in which you
read this file? Good. You see what I'm looking at. The one
force that surronds you constantly and that you fear you cannot
live without, technology.

Technology is the rope I swing on. Without technology and
computers, I would be a lost meanderer in a world of desolate
information. Think about it, every piece of information on 
yourself as a person, has been assigned a number, and has been
filed away. It has been filed away for any corporation or 
government to cast a large shadow over you, the individual.

What can be done to prevent this horrible tyranny? Simple.
Information must be liberated from the opressor. The information
must be of quality, and it must be read by the masses. A shift
of paradigms for the entire world would need to take place. An
utter catastrophe for those who wish to control you and I, the
governments and large corporations of the world.

There are many ways to liberate information. The first of
which is to hound out and seek new information daily. Read
a book instead of bieng bombarded with commercials on your
television set. Take up causes that the Electronic Frontier
Foundation and similar orginizations are pushing for. Be the
master of your own technology. Understand and will to learn
more about everything. Never feel inferior.

The rope I swing upon is slowly bieng gassed and burnt up by
crispy flames. I am starting to work towards my goal of bieng
an information God, one that the large businesses of the 
world and the nations of the world will not dare to fuck
around with. Someone who has approached Oneness, fought
against the powers that be, and has been made better because
of it.

I'm plunging ahead into a new world, a world that isn't
exactly going to be easy to survive in. I advocate becoming
a hacker, becoming part of the elite group that is seeking
out ways to better themselves, and the planet, and trying
to maintain a free world. Not one controlled by a tyrannical
opressionistic anti-freedom slave-loving aristocratic group
of corrupt men looming above you. Fight the powers that be.
