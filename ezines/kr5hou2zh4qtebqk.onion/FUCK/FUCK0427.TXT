                        What Makes It So?
                        -----------------

Sitting in geometry class, going over the homework from the night before,
and telling us what proved theory should have been applied instead of what
we had put down.  "Are there any questions?"  No one raises their hands, this
goes on throughout the whole assignment, as I am still looking at the first
problem, wondering why must it be that way?  Finally, he asks if there are
any questions whatsoever, before we move on, I rise my hand, and ask him,
"What makes it so?  I mean, why do all of these proved theories have to be
only that way?"  After a moment of the teacher looking at me in bewilderment,
and the other kids half-scoffing and rolling their eyes, as the other half
is almost asleep, it seems that I have caught the teacher off guard.  He then
begins trying to explain the reasoning behind it, and I question it.  As he
attempts this a couple of more times, and I repeat the questioning, he
suggests that I come in after class, or school, so we could discuss it
further, the bell rings, and everyone else jumps up - off to their next class.
I agree, and leave the room.

Laying downstairs on my sisters bed, going over lesson five of my Italian, I
ask my sister to explain to me why one adjective for short applies to a person
and the other applies to something else.  After her trying to explain it, as
she could, I come across another adjective and wonder the same thing, asking
her again, I ask her why she does not really know.  She explains, because
she never questioned the teacher, and if I really want to know, I should ask
the teacher tomorrow during class.  Making a note, I did end up asking in
class the next day.

These are just two cases, where I wondered "What makes it so?" when everyone
else seemed to just accept whatever the person had said was fact, and move on.
People just accepted that that was the way things were, and I was standing
there asking why.

If no one ever had asked why things were the way their were, we would never
have developed science, technology, or expanded our minds.  However, there
are so many people these days, that just go along with what whoever says goes
and never questions it.  A deafening of a culture, a deafening of
free-thought, a deafening of the human characteristic of curiosity.  This is
not a good sign, it is a very dangerous sign in my eyes.

It has been this same type of deafening and non-questioning attitude that
allowed horrible occurances such as the Holocaust, and other major wipe-outs
of culture and existance to happen.  Because, people simply accepted it as
it was, and never questioned why it was happening or that it could be wrong.
Even though there were some, throughout the years that have questioned things
such as animal testing, pre-neutal testing, and things of that nature, there
are that many more that do NOT, and just go on thinking and accepting that
things are just the way they are and there is nothing we or anyone else can
do about it.

Currently there is an ad on TV, that shows various clips of famous people,
that helped change and shape the world we live in, today.  Because of those
people asking "Why?" and not just accepting things the way they were, things
changed.  They believed they COULD make a difference, and to this day, that
difference has remained.  Perhaps, not as strongly as it maybe should have,
however, because they believed they could change the world, and would not just
accept things because 'that's they way things are', the were able to impact
not only their lives, others, and even sometimes an entire nation or world!

Sometimes questioning things too much is dangerous, though not questioning
things at all, is even more so.  If you never find out "What makes it so?"
how can you ever help make things better?  Or change things?  Or remember
and understand why things are the way they are.  It is important to know why,
and it is even more important to fully know "What makes it so?".
