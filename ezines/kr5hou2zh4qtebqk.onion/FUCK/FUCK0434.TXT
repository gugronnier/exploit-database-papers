          mercurial temperament
          ---------------------

  "Stars look nice tonight, don't they?"

  Laura looked at her boyfriend, Paul, and mentally groaned.

  "Yeah, they look great. Can you hand me that lighter?"

  Paul tossed his lighter at Laura and it caught her squarely in between
  her eyes. She swore and glared at him.

  "You have about as much grace as an elephant on crack, Paul."

  "Jesus, Laura, what it with you tonight? I can't seem to say or do
  anything right today."

  Laura zipped up her coat and pulled on the door handle of Paul's
  ancient Chevy. Nothing happened.

  "Dammit, Paul. I thought you got this door fixed."

  "It *was* fixed. I think you just trashed it again. Here, let me get out
  and open the door for you. I think we need to take a walk."

  Laura rolled her eyes and watched Paul as he got out of the car and
  walked around the front. He was a good-looking guy. Longish blond
  hair, intense blue eyes, nice physique.

  "Come on. Let's take a walk."

  Laura stepped out of the car and lit a Kamel, the red brand they brought
  back because "it tastes good". Paul reached for her hand but she put
  it in her coat pocket. For a moment she watched her breath cloud
  the crisp air.

  "Laura, please, tell me what is going on."

  Laura sighed deeply. "I think we should break up."

  "Why? I love you. What have I done to make you so angry?"

  "Nothing, not really. I just don't think that you and I are right for each
  other, that's all."

  "Oh, and who *is* right for you, Laura? Michael?"

  Laura's blue eyes blazed and she turned to face Paul.

  "As a matter of fact, he is perfect for me! He is not clumsy or stupid,
  he actually has a mind and he can use it, too. It's not something I
  would expect you to understand."

  "I see. And he is so perfect that he ignored you for 3 years while you
  were going through hell with that eating disorder and taking all sorts
  of anti-depressants. That doesn't make any sense, Laura."

  "He had his own issues to work out." Laura tossed her Kamel in the snow
  and lit another.

  "Excuses, always making excuses. So I'm clumsy. So I don't write
  beautiful words designed to make you lust after me. So what, Laura?
  I stuck by you, loved you, dealt with all of your bullshit. Why did I do
  that Laura?"

  "I dunno. Because you wanted to get laid?"

  "Fuck you. You know it was more than that. It is because I love you and
  want to see you be happy. Just because I am not Michael does not mean
  that I am not worthy of you."

  "That's your opinion. I love Michael, and I want to go back to him. No,
  quit   crying. You were a convenience, nothing more. He is ready for me,
  and I am going to go him, and no amount of tears can convince me that you
  are the right one for me. Your soul isn't beautiful enough. You are too
  plain."

  "Fine, if that's the way you want it, then be that way. I don't want to
  hear from you when he abandons you again."

  "Whatever, Paul. Just take me home."

  They went home in silence.


  [ two years later ]

  "Happy anniversary, Laura." Michael dropped a rose into Laura's lap.

  "I wrote a poem for you, today, darling. Would you like me to get you
  some champagne? I can read it to you, if you want."

  Laura frowned. "Sure, that's fine, Michael."

  Michael returned with the champagne and poured a small amount into
  her glass. She watched the bubbles race happily to the surface.

  "What's wrong, my darling? Did you have a bad day?"

  "Michael, we need to talk."

  "Certainly. What is it?"

  "Things aren't working out between us. I think we need to break things
  off."

  "But why? Everything has been wonderful between us for the last two
  years. What changed your mind?"

  "Well, I ran into Paul at the cafe the other day, and I realized that this
  romantic stuff just isn't me.. I prefer someone like Paul, honest and
  sensible. You always have your head in the clouds."
