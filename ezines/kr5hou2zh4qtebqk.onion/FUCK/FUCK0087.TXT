Your walking around a corner.
"Hey man, get the fuck out of here, this is OUR turf"
You walk somewhere else
"Hey man, you want a bullet in your head?"
You go somewhere else
"Where the fuck you think your going? we'll kill you you don't leave!"
etc.. etc..
You shoot yourself.
"Fuck this"

F.U.C.K., The Point

As you can see. The InterNet is become a home for lamers, perverts, ego
GODS and dumb asses who shouldn't even be using a computer. You got people
who just sit in one channel all day long, or Bots wondering around so some
people don't lose their ops in a channel. And it seems like whenever
someone gets access to The Net they turn into egotistical morons who just
go around thinking they are gods, and everypiece of information they get
is worth gold and no one on this earth should be allowed to see. What it
all is, is "Net Surfers" fighting for Net Territory. Now this might sound
dumb at first, but let me take you on a little tour and change your world
view.

The InterNet used to be a place where people could go to get information
fast. A place where the smart computer users could talk about anything
they damn well please. Now you see about 3000-5000 people in IRC at times,
and some of those aren't even people, just robots wondering around. It
used to be where mostly everyone knew all the good FTP sites, because
there were only few. And now, how many times do you see "Anyone got a list
of anonymous FTP sites?" or "Anyone know of a good site to get ANSI Packs/
Zines/Viruses/Demos/anything else"? And now how many mirror sites do you
see, or sites that carry the same stuff another one does, but you look
over it in hopes to find one maybe two things the other one didn't? How
many news groups were there in the past? Do we really need an "alt.wesley.
crusher.die.die.die"? The only thing on InterNet that remains the same is
the EMail system. I have never seen anyone ask for another users Email
address. And it's a LOT better then NetMail, and a lot cheeper then
calling Long Distance and leaving EMail on the same BBS the person you are
emailing is on.

Now, here is what is going to happen because of all this. Most users will
find a group. And a lot of groups will form. Some user will not join any
group, and those will be the already powerful ones with their hand in
many groups. All the lamers that sit around in #hotsex will be thrown off
as the war takes place. The Groups will fight for NetTurf. People will
have other people blacklisted which in turn will get them blacklisted by a
friend of the person they blacklisted, which in turn will... etc.. etc..
Powerful scripts will be created. Bots whose only purposes are to wait for
a channel to lose all it's member and then take it over and make the
channel private so they may never use it again. This will do nothing tho.
As groups can just form #hotsex2, or what not. Groups will hide FTP sites,
and news groups will be filled with threats. People will receive large
amounts of Email threatening them. And then, as everything must, things
will wonder off of the net and onto other things. Groups will take over
BBSes making them private for only a few. Groups will setup spies to join
other groups who will relay information to the real group they are in.
People will become so enraged at the users groups that all Zines will
start becoming lame. The great Zines will die, or circulate in a VERY
elite underground full of people who are either group less, or don't want
a part in it. Zines will start popping up that detail on what has recently
happened, who went from what group to what group. Who left the scene, who
is new. Whats avl. for the taking, what had been taken over, etc.. And
then, the group of very elite underground users will one day just try to
take everything over. This will cause every group to start attacking while
they can. On every net, from Internet, American Online and SkyLink to
Stormwatch, Dead and Nuke. They will all become part of the battle, even
private BBSes who wanted to stay out of it will fall into it. New viruses
will be created, new systems, smarter people. And then everyone will make
one last effort to come out on top. Small groups will start falling, Dumb
groups will start falling. And then, as the only groups left start trying
to crash other groups systems it will all start falling apart. Every
Network and system around the world will fall and crash, become totally
useless. And all the people all across the world will be silent, for a
moment. They will just stare into their blank monitors, and they will
think. Then all at once they will try to reboot their systems, and nothing
will happen. Every Network, every system, everything.....  gone.
And I ask you... after all this...  Whats Next? What comes after all this?
Well...... lets find out.
