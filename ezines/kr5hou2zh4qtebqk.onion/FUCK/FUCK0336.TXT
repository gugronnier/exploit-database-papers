                        Anarchy's Guide to Life
                        -----------------------

Chapter 1 - Introduction

 Well, welcome to my guide to life. First off, life sucks. It has its good
 points, but if you look at it as a whole, it sucks. You need to know a few
 things to get through it, and I'm here to provide you with that information.
 Well, there are gonna be some things in here that you may not like hearing.
 And this text will probably be on television sometime, possibly being called
 bad or evil, but everything in this text is the ABSOLUTE TRUTH AS I KNOW IT.
 It may not be what everyone tells you, or discusses with you, but it IS THE
 TRUTH AS I KNOW IT. Believe it if you want, however, as I also believe in
 complete freedom of thought and information.

Chapter 2 - Cheating

 Have your parents told you "Cheaters never win..."? Well, they almost always
 win. And they'll end up getting better grades than non-cheaters, leading to
 better jobs, and helping them gain things that those who do not cheat might
 never afford. They'll have better cars, better homes, more money, and perhaps
 many other things. Do yourself a favor and cheat. Cheat on tests, of every
 kind, and do not get caught, and you will be much better off because of it.
 Some good advice though: If you score over 90% on a test, there's no need to
 cheat. And if you're going to cheat, start small, and do what works, because
 if you get caught, you're dead.


Chapter 3 - Education

 School: Does it suck? Of course it sucks. The whole system isn't working and
 yet it's still being labeled as being "not screwed-up enough" to fix. Well,
 the only real education you need is the one you get from experience. Yeah,
 that's right, good old fashioned experience. Go through something enough times
 and you'll learn to deal with it, or even use it to your best advantage. This
 is why lab experiments and hands-on training are the most important parts of
 a persons education. If you learn only through textbooks and lectures, you'll
 never learn anything that'll really help you, and you might even become so
 bored that you'll forever dislike the subject you're learning about. A good
 thing to do is when you get bored of a subject, ask the person teaching you
 about it, nicely, when you're going to need that subject when you get older.
 You may actually get a very nice response. If you don't (like an answer that
 includes something like 'if you go into the field of...') tell the teacher
 you won't be going into that field, or any like it, and ask if you can sleep
 or leave during that subject's teaching.


Chapter 4 - Money

 Money is everything. If you examine it closely, you can buy anything with it
 including love. I believe I'll be asked to explain this, so I'll do that now.
 You use money to go out with people, to buy them things (that might "show your 
 affection"), to pay for your actions that prove your love, to pay for your
 wedding, engagement rings, anniversary presents, etc... Money is good for
 everything. The problem is that it's usually very hard to legally get money.
 You could work, and that's not what I meant was hard. The hard part is trying
 to find a decently paying job that you like, or even can tolerate. Most of
 all people who work dislike their jobs, but do them anyway because they've
 had a lot of trouble finding a job before and don't want to be unemployed.
 Some good ways to get money are to collect things that are worth a small
 amount of money and selling them when they become very popular, to sell
 old toys and objects you no longer need or use anymore. Toys are usually good
 for this, as are books, but don't rule out anything.


Chapter 5 - Freedom

 You are not free. If you were free, you wouldn't have to go to school, or do
 anything that you, as a free-minded individual, do not want to do. You are
 forced to learn little or nothing significant every day on the news and in
 the newspapers. You are not free to carry a weapon without a license. If
 you go to Rat Shack (A.K.A. Radio Shack) they'll ask for your name and address
 and a lot of other information, except if you try to buy things that could be
 used to commit a crime, they probably won't sell them to you, or use the
 information to help convict you of a crime. A lot of people double-park, but
 it's still illegal. If someone tries to hurt you, and you hurt them before
 they can hurt you, you could go to jail and they could go free. You are not
 free.


Chapter 6 - Fear

 The best motivation and only true motivation is fear. People are afraid of
 many things in life, and it always affects the way they live and act. People
 tend not to sit next to people they think are suspicious in public places.
 If you dress differently than the rest of society, or act strangely, people
 will tend to be afraid of you. If you are repeatedly bothered by a specific
 type of person, whether it's their race, color, number of appendages, you will
 act differently towards that type of person. As a child, parents will attempt
 to rid you of fear, telling you that you have nothing to worry about, and
 that they'll protect you. But they are wrong. They cannot protect you. Your
 local police cannot protect you. You are the only person who can protect YOU.
 You should fear your police, your government, and anyone else who has some
 effect on how your life is run besides you.


Chapter 7 - The Media

 Hey, take a guess at who controls your mind. That's right, the media. Not
 really books, or magazines even, but those whose job it is to tell you the
 news. Newspapers, Radio shows, and Television are all affecting the way you
 think. If you watch the news, then you will believe the news unless you take
 a stand and realize that news programs want you to watch them. They give you
 what you want, and they show you what you want to see. If you want to see less
 violence in society, then that's what they will show you. If you are hearing
 a lot about technology, then they will do a story on technology, and offer a
 viewpoint or information about technology that you will think only they have.
 In a news report about software piracy, the only person they questioned to
 have both his voice changed AND his face blacked out was put in jail for one
 and a half years, for "hacking"..???? What the hell does hacking have to do
 with piracy? Is this supposed to make him an authority, on something he has
 know idea about? The media is ignorant and manipulative.


Chapter 8 - Wake up

 In case you don't know it, all niceties in society are lies. There is no Santa
 Claus, and there is no Easter Bunny. There is no savior and there is no cure.
 Society is breaking down, and instead of working to rebuild it, the smart are
 protecting themselves from it, and the weak are constantly pumping an illusion
 of peace into society. Arm yourself. Arm yourself and learn about survival and
 protection. And protect yourself, and those you love, because society IS going
 to come down.


Chapter 9 - Speak free

 Be vulgar. Go ahead and say those words which were formally or are still not
 acceptable to come out of your mouth. Release the built up tension, and the
 long lost animality, and be vulgar. Learn your rights, and push, push, push
 them to their limits, and then build new limits. You must do this or your
 rights will slowly and quietly be taken away from you. 


Chapter 10 - Justice

 Justice does not exist in today's society. No matter how much you work at
 something, you'll always be run-over by someone who worked less to get more,
 through the ignoring of rules, and laws. If you want something, take it. You
 can buy it, but if you deserve it, and you cannot gain it any other way, then
 take it. Our government is not working. Don't spend your life trying to make
 it better, because it won't work. Either work around it, or work to destroy
 it, but feeble attempts to change government (which is now a self-feeding
 monster) will not work. You will fail. It used to work with us, the people,
 but it does not. It does not need us to survive, and if we get in it's way,
 it will trample on us.


Chapter 11 - Fun

 Y'know what's fun? Violence, sex, drugs, alcohol, and vandalism. Go out, get
 some drugs or alcohol, and mess up your mind. It feels good. Or be a bit more
 safe and commit acts of violence or vandalism. Do you go to school? Well, go
 to an "Animal Rights"-type club and eat hot dogs. Rip down posters, and draw
 pentagrams all over the place. Erase stuff on other peoples' computers. Go
 into stores and unplug, misplace, and break things. Call up as many phone
 numbers as you can and prank them. When people ask you questions, give them
 wrong answers, and when they ask how you got that answer, or why, tell them
 "Satan told me" or "The voices in my head tell me to kill". Call every single
 company you come across and ask for free things. Spend their money. If they
 refuse, tell them that they suck, and you won't buy anything else from them.
 And of course, for the greatest fun, have lots and lots of sex. But protect
 yourself. After all, no one cares about you, but you.


Chapter 12 - Death

 We all will die someday, and when we do, it will be a dark, lonely, and cold
 time. We all die alone, and if you think you're going to be saved, or brought
 to "heaven" or a utopia, you can forget about it. If heaven existed, then
 why would the Pope want a bullet-proof car with bodyguards surrounding it?
 Is he afraid to die, and go to HEAVEN??? What the hell is wrong with this
 society? Wake up! You will die eventually (unless SCIENCE saves you) and you
 will join your ancestors, in a hole in the ground. But if your life is so
 bad that you'd rather not live, then don't get your head filled with lies
 about trying to find jesus, or smelling the roses. Kill yourself.
