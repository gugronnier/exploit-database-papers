                   Legion's Rants, Part Whatever...
                   --------------------------------

More rants.

The government (stop groaning. Of course you need to hear it again). My
dad's moving to Mexico. He was down there on vacation and watched the
news. The news showed flight 800 being smacked by a missile. Yet we're
"still trying to put the puzzle together." Bah.

Underworld (OK, so these aren't all rants...). This shit rocks my world.
Just picked up _dubnobasswithmyheadman_. Woo.

People. Yes, people. Just this very second I was in #depression asking a
friend with MPD to calm down a little because she was manic and flooding
the channel with the Smiths' song lyrics. Someone else who wanted support
left because of her and started bitching at me when I tried to explain her
actions. Then *she* left and started bitching at me for "trying to bring
her down" (this was a very young, manic personality). Then she put me on
ignore when I tried to explain that I was trying to keep the channel in
order. Then she crashed when I called her and explained it voice. "You can
please half the people half the time, but people fucking suck."

More people...my ex is either playing head games with everyone (she seems
to like attention) or something is really wrong...and she won't return
calls or email, and her parents haven't heard from her in a week...yet
according to her finger info she was logged into her account yesterday at
around 5.30 pm and was on for an hour before she telnetted from there to
another account, which she was apparently on for a while.

My sister. Oh wait, what sister? Fuck her.

Radio music. I get to listen to a local R&B/rap/homey G/top 40/shit
station at work (whee). One day they played one song 5 (yes! 5!) times
during my 8-hour shift. They played another one 4 times during my shift. I
brought my radio and some tapes in and played a Front Line Assembly
single, some Skinny Puppy, and some Pestilence one day. It was a nice
sense of balance.

My job. But it's better than no job at all, so I won't bitch about it
here.

Cheesy low-rent sci-fi flicks that butcher Heinlein's original
masterpieces. I'll still see _Starship Troopers_ (Pyroxylin tells me it's
pretty good), but why can't someone like James Cameron make a Heinlein
movie and pump millions of dollars into the special effects and hire
decent actors? Christ. Speaking of which, the movie _Screamers_ was a
total fuckup of Phillip K. Dick's (_Bladerunner_) original story, "The
Second Variety." And don't even get me started on Stephen King movies...

The fact that the woman I love is 850 miles away, and I'm just moving out
there as a friend to see if anything develops, with no guarantees, and the
fact that I just got a job at a large company that has no branches out
there, and I'll have to start my job search over, and the fact that I
don't have much confidence in myself, which really seems to irritate her,
and the fact that I ramble on and on like this for hours at a time just to
fill up space so Dis will print this.  :P

IRC. But I'm fucking addicted, what can I say? For one thing, it's the
only way I can talk to my loved one since she lives at home and her
parents are nosy (and yes, she *is* over 18, Apok). I sometimes spend
upwards of 10 hours a day on irc, and I don't read very much anymore. And
typing fast without concern for spelling or correct punctuation has
affected my writing skills negatively.

You, the reader. If you read something in FUCK that you don't like, write
to the author and tell him or her. The same goes for articles you do like.
Feedback is what makes our brains learn (on a neural level). Similarly,
verbal and written feedback help us learn at higher levels. I've noticed
that we readers tend to be too passive at times.

Hypocrites. I myself rarely write to the authors or Dis to mention how I
felt about a particular article. But my excuse is that I'm a lazy bastard
who spends all of his time on irc. Maybe I'll have the willpower to change
this soon.
