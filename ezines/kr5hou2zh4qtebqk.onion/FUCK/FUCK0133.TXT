                             Repetative History
                             ------------------

        I recently argued with a few people on a board [Virtual Utopia]
about history not repeating itself.  I argued that all historty was
original in it's origins, and thusly followed no specific outline. 
I have since then changed my views.  My original idea was only partially
correct; all history -IS- original in it's origins, but -DOES- follow a
4 billion year old pattern.  Let me explain, since I'm sure this sounds
like gibberish.

        Lets begin with some topics that are fairly recent, shall we?
Neo-Nazis.  In WWII, the Americans and our allies were attacking 
Germany and the Nazis, correct?  We basically eradicated the problem,
and freed the Jews, right?  Now, AMERICA is facing the same problem
with Nazis.  We have Neo-Nazis ['cuz we're new age and neo!].  What
the fuck is going on here?  We eradicated the problem in Germany. Can
we not do the same thing in our own country?  Of course not.  We need
to wait until they start grabbing hostages and threaten the well being
of the country -- then we ask for other peoples help because it's 
gone too far for the military to fix.  The United States takes too much
fucking care of other countries to worry about our own problems, but I 
will talk about that in another file -- unless there allready is one, 
that is.  Here we are, an "advanced" culture, and we take care of other
countries problems before our own?  That has caused far too many
problems in the past -- that right there illustrates the topic of
repetative history quite well, doesn't it?   Now, I don't know how
this whole situation is going to turn out in the future, but I 
believe I can guess : The Neo-Nazis are going to start setting up 
concentration camps for black people and start sending them to the 
camps.  After they've killed about 5 million, the government will
send out a plea for help.  It will be answered, and we will be saved,
but not after a considerable loss of life.  Governmental action is
a severe problem in the United States, and I believe they should
start learning from their mistakes.

        The next topic will entail explaining a user/sysop in the 
303 area code.  If you don't want to read about it, skip to the
next paragraph, because quite frankly, this is probably the best
use of repetative hisory I have ever seen.  Lets begin.  The user
is named Syanide, and runs a board called FLUiD [yes, don't forget
the little 'i'].  I could go on and on about how lame he is, but I
won't, since I don't feel like typing that much, and that's not
what this file is discussing. :)  Now, about 2 years ago [I 
believe] a user named Econ arrived in the PD scene.  He ran a  
board [the name eludes be at this present time].  He was fine,
he didn't really get on anyone's nerves, since we all dismissed
him as a PD lamer.  However, he started reading the "elite" nets
in 303, and unanimously decided by himself that he should be
an "elite" person.  So, Econ dissapears, and Sarquin plops into
existance, and runs a board called The Timless Universe.  He
started pleading to the "elite" people in 303 asking for help
on the board -- he got it.  People weren't aware that we was
Econ until sometime later.  Since he has always been extremely
afraid of his past, present and future, he lies about everything.
He lied one too many times, and his cosysops decided to leave --
as did all his users.  We put him on a areacode-wide blacklist.
About 2 months ago, a user named Syanide showed up with the
excuse that he had lived in Michigan until now [he tried not to
let us know he was Sarquin], and wanted to start new in this
area code.  I got his new user app on Virtual Utopia [I am a
cosysop there] and was suspiscious.  I checked his info he put
in, and since Sarquins' info was common knowledge by now, I
relized he was an imposter, and was in fact Sarquin.  I 
revealed this info to only a few people at first, but figured
I might as well inform the general public.  They reacted
negativly, and eventually boycotted the board he ran, FLUiD,
except for a few fake users we would use to make fun of him.

        Rather than go on with that, I will now switch to some
more repetative history, of a little smaller [or larger, whichever
you subscribe to] scale.

        Condors are almost extinct because we like wood for
fires -- we're obsessed with it.  The dodo bird is extinct
because we can hit them with bats.  Bald Eagles are almost
extinct because we like feathers.  What does that show?  
Selfishness.

        I leave you with this:  Humans follow the same pattern 
for all decisions they make.  It's a 4 billion year old pattern,
created when the earth was made, and we continue to follow it.
It is each individual's right and JOB to take a stand and let
the general public know this -- it's very important.  We must
break out of this pattern, or we will plunge into another 
Civil War -- the indications are very much the same.  Lets
mend our wounds, so we don't shake salt on them.
