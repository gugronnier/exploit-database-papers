                                Club Asshole
                                ------------

So this is the hour when the mystries emerge. Here i am sitting typing on
this thing yet again. It's been a long week for me.  A very long week.
In my `profession' I do radio live-to-air productions. You know the things
that simply broadcast a night at a club. I have been doing them for just over
one year now. Something I allways knew may happen but was never ready for
happened this weekend. It will no doubt burn it's image into my mind
something that I will never forget. It happened in the lobby. It was a very
good night in terms of the attendance something that we did not really
expect considering it was the Canada day long weekend <july 1> and the heavy
rain that was falling outside. All drinks were on for $1.25 <very cheap here>
and so people were in the general mood that one gets into on such a night.
Unfortunatly, there always seems to be the bad drunk. You know the asshole.
The guy with the loud mouth, sports-celebrity haired sorta act going on.
Mr. tough guy. The school bully. Shit like that. Unfortunatly the person
who starts the shit going. This weekend it went too far. It was the first
time i have seen such a thing happen. I read about it in the newspapers all
the time, but it never realy hit home. I knew such a thing would eventually
cross my path, but cought up in other things never really thought about it.
First word I heard in the matter was that there was blood all over the
lobby. Thought that was that but no, it was more than just some asshole
getting stabbed. Idiot cops decided they would be the tough guys and
close the place down at 2am with 800+ people still in there. The D.J. <cool
guy, good friend> said to them that the remaining people would flip if they
did that. Did the pigs listen? Nope. Closed the place down and they were
rioting in the parking lot. Wonderful. Gonna start rambling now i think.
All fucked up on tylenol 3's right now. Just had 2 teeth pulled. Nasty thing
coke is. Rotted out a bunch of them. Oh well, fuck it. Still love a nice
cold can o coke.. So, between the codine and the joy division cd in the
cd-rom drive <fuck the bbs users, they have access to my cd-roms all the
time> it's a good night for rambling.
Back to the club. I have wondered since starting this job why people who know
they turn into assholes bother drinking. They must know they do. It's always
the same people getting booted out or getting into fights. Yet they do not
learn. Tis funny. Most of my friends get their `altered state of mind'
through other, well shall we say herbal means. Strange how that never
turns people into total assholes. Yet that's illegal in this place.
Strange... I guess i get to see more shit go down in working in clubs 5
nights a week. For me it's not a good time as much as work. Get to see
people at their worst. Or possibly their best. I will never know. People are
all the same. Except for a few i guess as i do have some people I consider
ok. Society considers those people fucked. Perhaps some re-evaluation is
needed here. Lets look at real people <in my biased opinion> and the people
that comprise the social structures.

Real People		Society's products
-----------		------------------
Careing                 Couldn't give a shit
Truthfull               Only true if it benefits them
Thinkers		Followers
Outcasts		The `cool' ones
	
The list could go on and on. Although I doubt that anyone who reads these
things really needs to hear too much about that. Dead Kat and Demonika have
talked about their dealings with people in past F.U.C.K. issues. Wish I could
say I didn't know where they were coming from, but i do. Regrettably with one
additional problem. The people I am forced to deal with are none to often
totaly out of it thanx to alcohol. Not to knock drinking fer pleasure, but
why is it the same asshole who gets all fucked up and then comes up to the dj
booth, mistakes me for the dj and then starts giving me attitude for telling
him/her that i am in fact not the dj so not to blame me for not playing the
music that they want to hear. If i tell them to fuck off, i would be the one
who gets in shit. Figure that one out. So, how do we fix them? Can we fix
them? Last question would be is it worth the time?  These people seem
incapable of change, too set in their ways to acnowlage difference.
Difference in their eyes is a bad thing. Perhaps they will find out over
time...

"There's a club if you want to go
You might find someone who really loves you
So you go and you stand on your own
And you leave on your own
And you go home and you cry
And you want to die" -The Smiths

Meeting people at clubs is hard as hell too. Too loud and the attitudes all
fucked. It's not a place where people go and have a good time as much as go
looking upon it as some sort of fashion show. If you look good your in.
If not, fuck you. I dunno where in the hell people get the idea they are good
places to meet people but they aren't. Oh well, blow that idea away. Ack,
i am getting into trashing the places. So, here i am in the mode of the
latter part of the smiths quote. Death would be welcomed currently. People
take their toll on you. Yet I know i will be going out again tomorrow and
once again pretending to have a good time. Occasionally I really do, but
that's rare. Besides, that's hard considering its all dance music. Not the
stuff fer me. Oh well, let me tell you, hard core punk, goth and New Wave
<they call it retro. fuck them> sounds great on 50,000 watt club systems.
Well, at least before they open....:)

        So, once again, This is the hour when mystries emerge... Every night
I go to work hopeing that things will be different but they never are. Same
assholes different day. Thinking thinking thinking but with no way to truely
express my thoughts. Brain is mush. Likely the T-3's or just the fact that
people work me up too much. Stupidity must be a nice thing. Not giving a shit
about anyone except yourself. Not fer me though. Did that once before and
looking back it was way worse than thinking and seeing. Anyways, I am getting
tiered and some coding becons, so I am off for now. Then tomorrow at the
clubs again. But for now..... For now i dream of a place where people think
globally and not just for themselves.....
