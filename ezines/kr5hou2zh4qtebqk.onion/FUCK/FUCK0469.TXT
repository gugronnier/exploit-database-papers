                        --------------------

I want to look at my world with new glasses. For too long I have just 
watched the bright spots and realize now that I've missed too much 
around me. These notes are attempts to share those new found vistas as 
I become aware of them.

Yesterday, as I drove up to the shelter, I saw them, huddled together 
in the frigid wind, waiting. Tired, gray men, mostly. Beaten down and 
resigned, anticipating the moment when the door would open and for a 
few hours, at least, they could retreat from the street. 

I've been coming here for years. So many faces are familiar by now.  
And yet each time there are new people too. People with luggage, I call 
them, because they have not yet learned to shed their suitcases and 
bags. 

Silently the guests queue up for mail or soap or a chance to use the 
iron. For some, there is still a desire to look fresh. But for most, 
there is the taint of too few showers and unwashed clothes. There is 
generally a stench about the shelter - a kind of musky heavy smell that 
defies description - a smell that I've never smelled any where else. 
After all these years, I seldom seem to notice it any more.

Religious Mass is held and then the services begin to open around the 
big room. Showers start and the nurse begins to see patients. Alcohol 
counseling is offered and job referrals. Some people do a few odd jobs 
so that they can get a change of clothing. There are always more jobs 
available than there are people who are interested in doing them. Mail 
is very busy. 

Sometimes I wonder why I come down here every Sunday. I long ago 
realized I would not directly change anyone's life here. The early 
optimism of "making a difference" was quickly erased. Later, working 
with the alcoholics, I've had this realization reinforced. Where it 
would have seemed that the people on the street would be ready for a 
chance to improve their lives, I have found they are highly resistant 
to change. Working in the shelter has come to be much like I imagine 
working in a hospice would be. By that I mean that we make the 
residents comfortable.  We offer many more things to them. But most go 
unused. 

Still there have been successes too. People have come and shared parts 
of their lives. There have been those moments where that spark of 
delight has flashed in eyes across the counter. There have been those 
times where I've felt like I did make a difference.

Noon approaches. Soon the men and the occasional woman will begin to 
drift out, heading for the catholic soup kitchen or perhaps to the 
Samaritan shelter to wait for a bed. The nurse shuts down her clinic. 
The alcohol session has been ignored again. The mail is put up. The 
door is closed and locked. And after gathering for a closing prayer, we 
go too.

Part of my dichotomy. From there I go backstage at the Nutcracker to 
watch the ballet. Somehow it seemed fitting to have a day grounded in 
both sides of the spectrum. Sitting in the darkened wings, watching the 
young ballerinas bouncing and jumping to limber up for their moment on 
the stage reminded me of football players anxiously waiting for their 
moment of glory. I was surprised that the large cast was mostly teenage 
girls. But then I realized that most boys are probably not interested 
in ballet. It was the second to the last performance and I could feel 
the exhaustion in the wings. They are ready for this year to end.

During intermission we went out into the crowd in their furs and 
jewels. It seemed so far far far away from the shelter of the morning. 

I can appreciate both worlds. There have been moments in my life where 
I've felt like I have been outside looking in. And other moments where 
it seemed nothing could be better.  But what I realize is that both of 
these are part of all of us. Those faceless homeless lonely men and 
those dancing whirling ballerinas and those comfortable contented 
matrons are all part of the whole. We, each of us, have our roles to 
fill, our parts to play. I know that for me the opportunity I have been 
given has made my life richer. Each of these people, whether they will 
ever know it or not, bring joy to my life. And it makes me hungry for 
more. Thank you for being a part of that life force. Regardless of our 
individual and collective outcomes, your life has given a spark to 
mine. And it seems to me that that is what all of this is all about. 

Smiles.
