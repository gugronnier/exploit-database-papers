                                   Quotes
                                   ------

"Life is for the strong, to be taken from the weak..." 
                         - The Most Dangerous Game (Richard Connel)


I think computer viruses should count as life ... I think it says something
about human nature that the only form of life we have created so far is
purely destructive.  We've created life in our own image.  --S.Hawking

"those with no wounds are the unluckiest of all"  - Robert Bly

"Ah, but Christians were meddlers, and a man on the run from 
death, duty, and who else knew what else? was a man who
hadn't need meddling with.
                                -Jitterbug Perfume

"The only organization I ever joined in my life was the 
Columbia Record Club, and I had to get out of that because it 
was too disciplined"    
                                -Jitterbug Perfume


               "Originality is the art of concealing your sources."
                           "I believe that the people
                         in power - not only political
                            power, but also economic
                          and social power - will not
                           nonviolently give up that
                              power to the people.
                            Power is not a material
                             possession that can be
                           given.  It is the ability
                          to act.  Power must be taken
                             it is never given..."
                                        -William Powell

"There is a tendancy today to absolve individuals of moral responsibility
and treat them as victims of social circumstance.  You buy that and you
pay with your soul."                          -???

        
        It's not men who limit women ...
        It's not straights who limit gays ...
        It's not whites who limit blacks ...
        What limits people is lack of character.
        What limits people is that they don't have the fucking
        nerve or imagination to star in their own movie -- 
        let alone direct it.
                        
                        From:   Still Life With Woodpecker
                        By:     Tom Robbins


"One should not fear that they may die, but that they may never live..."


"You {war} teach men how to die, while peace shows them only how to live. You
cleanse the world; Peace litters it with corruption."
              -- Yates Sterling

"There is no use talking about abolishing war, that's damn foolishness. Take 
the guns away from men and they will fight just the same."
              -- S. Butler

"A single death is a tragedy, a million deaths is a statistic."
              -- Joseph Stalin

"To my mind, to kill in war is not a whit better than to commit ordinary 
murder."
              -- Albert Einstein

"I have never advocated war except as a means of peace."
              -- Ulysses S. Grant
