                        The Anatomy of Love                        
                        -------------------

        "As I gaze upon your face,
        My strong-willed heart begins to race.
        Emotions in captivity,
        Break their bonds and long for thee.
        
        And as I gaze into your eyes,
        Behind my back time lights and flies,
        But I care not for time gone by,
        And for your love long now, long I."

        A  simple poem.  Written  in a moment  of passion and longing  
for a beautiful and captivating woman.  I was in love to describe the
moment in its base  case.  But as I look  back on  this I  ask myself 
what  love really  is?  Is it a brief  physical experience, or a deep
emotional involvement?

        Many people in society have different views of this so-called 
"love".  One such view is love as a physical and lustful emotion.  To
be involved  physically with a  woman is love.   Others believe  that
love is that of kinship, totally disassociated from lust and longing.
Still  others believe that  love is a deep  and dark emotion that has
ruled the hearts of  mankind for ages.  Yet others  believe that love
has no place in society today.

        With  so  many different  classifications  of love  one  must 
determine  for himself what  love is.  I have  based my definition of
love  off of my  experiences in  life.  I  have been in relationships
of  kinship  or friendship.  I  have seen  the dark  side of love.  I
have been exposed to the physical side of love.  But I find that love 
is much, much more than anything that can be contemplated by mankind.

        As  I continue,  I will  focus my discussion  on love  to the
romantic  aspect of love.  The interchange of love between two people
of the opposite sex.  If you  find my definition of romantic  love to
be lacking or  incorrect then maybe  you should  not be  reading this
file,  as  you can gain  nothing  from it.  For everyone  else, let's
continue...

        In  my poem I describe  emotions that come forth as I look at
the face of my lover.  My heart, which has been weathered to love and
involvements is released  from its  confinement and intertwines  with
that of another.  For the first  time I love with  no reservation.  I
have lost all preception  of time and  order and all I  care about it
whether or not that love is returned.

        The question I want to raise is whether or not  this love can
ever be returned fully.  As my relationship with this woman developed
I found myself constantly thinking about her.  Hardly an hour went by
when I did not question what she was thinking about, or  what she was
doing.  My  mind  continually  rolled back to the past and time spent
with her.  I was  lost.  There  was no understanding of this love.  I
was, and to a degree still am, captured by this woman.

        As time progressed I fell deeper and deeper into the abyss of
emotional attachment.  The bottom was not in sight and I kept falling
fast.  Unfortunately she was distancing  herself from me.  One of the
most important  things in my  life was slowly  moving  outside of  my
grasp.  I had  no  control over what she was doing.  No matter what I
did  to show her  my love, nor how much I sacrificed for her, I never 
felt an equal reciprocation of my emotions.

        And now she's gone...  and all I  can do is ponder what I can
learn  from  the  destruction  of my  heart.   I look  to the future, 
thinking about what lies  ahead of me.  Can I go on?   Maybe.  I will
work hard to  rid myself of this ball and chain that forever drags me
down, but will I ever rid myself of her memory?  Probably not.

        What  can I  learn?  I can realize that love will never allow
itself  to be conquered by the feeble attempts of mankind.  It always
has its  own twisted  initiative to  accomplish.  Eventually, mankind
will  be  destroyed by  his desire to caputure that which no cage can
contain.  No one  can  ever  be satisfied  by the creature  that love 
personifies.  Therefore, do  not  expect anything  in the future.  Do 
not hope for the  acceptance and unconditional love that you offer to 
others.  It will  never  be returned  until you  are in the cradle of 
heaven...
