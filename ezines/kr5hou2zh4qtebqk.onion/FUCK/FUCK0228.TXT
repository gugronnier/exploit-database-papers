                             Apathy and Laziness
                             -------------------

     Who cares? That's what I really want to know. I'm sure most 
people would LIKE to care, but must people are too lazy to bother. I'm a 
perfect example. I read through the various F.U.C.K. files thinking "Man, 
that's right...I'm just like that...or I should start doing that...or 
someone needs to put a stop to that." But do I do anything about it? Nope...
I'm too fucking lazy to get off my ass and make even a simple change. Or 
is it that I don't care enough to bother?
     Apathy is bad. Laziness is bad. The two in combination are 
destructive.
     If you're lazy, you can always muster enough energy to 
accomplish whatever it is you need to do. If you don't care, you can still
do whatever it is that needs done, just with no enjoyment or pride in it 
whatsoever. But if you're lazy AND you don't care, then what could possibly
inspire you to do anything? And what happens when you become so lazy and
apathetic that you stop bothering to do things you DO care about? The only
force more powerful than apathy and laziness is anger. Unfortunately apathy
and laziness are an awesome tag-team and it takes a whole lot of anger to
overcome them.
     For example, I'm watching the Olympics right now. Michael 
Johnson just won his first gold medal 2 minutes ago and set a new Olympic
record in the process. That's pretty kewl, but isn't of particular interest
to me since I'm not much of a Track and Field fan. But just last week, the
sport I DO take interest in, Women's Gymnastics, was on.
     Kerry Strug, one of the underdogs on the US team stuck a perfect 
vault towards the end of the team competition. Her score was just enough to 
push the United States into the first place spot, stealing the victory 
from a Russian team that thought the gold was in their hands. She landed 
this event winning vault and stuck her landing with a crowd winning smile.
And not until the judges had gotten their impressions and tabulated their 
scores did she let it be known that she had severely sprained her ankle
during her landing.
     This occured during my favorite Olympic event by one of my favorite
gymnasts and will go down in Olympic history. And where was I at the 
time? Sitting on my best friends couch bitching and whining for a ride 
home because I was too lazy to walk 5 fucking blocks. I can just imagine 
the goosebumps I would have had if I had witnessed this event when it 
happened. I'll have to imagine them, because I'll never have another
chance to experience them.
     As I mentioned earlier, in large amounts anger can defeat apathy 
and laziness. And there was plenty of anger accumulated after I found out 
what I had missed. I think it actually did me some good. I'm still 
apathetic. I'm still lazy. But now whenever I need to do something and
start putting it off, I think back to the little piece of history I
missed and the anger wells up inside again and I find the will to do
whatever it is that needs to be done.
     What's the moral of this story? There really isn't one. I don't 
expect any victim's of tag-team apathy and laziness to actually do anything 
because they read this. If they did, that would completely invalidate 
everything I just wrote. I don't know what the point of this file is, or
why I bothered to write it. And actually, I don't really care.
