                       Stand By Me Day
                       ---------------

	This is my first writing for FUCK, so it may be a bit
unpolished... I apologize.  

        At my school (I am in eighth grade), Friday May 30 is
"Stand By Me Day".  On that day, some guest speakers are going
to come and "rap" (yes, that's how the notice put it) with
students, discussing such issues as "sex, drugs, and AIDS".
Also, a couple local 80's bands are rumored to come and play
on that day.  Sounds interesting?  Yes, it did.  Until I heard
the rumor.
	Apparently, students are expected to dress "nicely".
What does that mean?  Good question.  I posed the question to
my English teacher, Ms. X.  (I don't know why I'm using
pseudonyms.  Just bear with me.)  She responded by saying
"dress nicer than usual".  Girls should wear dresses, and boys
should wear nice pants.  No jeans, if possible.  "Just dress
nicely".  We surmised that we were being asked to dress nicely
to impress guest speakers, and give the school a good impression
and give the principal a nice warm fuzzy feeling inside.  Don't
ask.
	Then, Ms. X mentioned that those students who did not
dress nicely would be placed in "a little room" for the day.
(Keep in mind that all regular classes are canceled for the
day.)  This room is the equivelant of In-School Suspension,
except not as harsh.  No, she was not joking.  I have a memo
that only teachers were supposed to see.  It's true.  Why would
students be placed in a little room for not dressing nicely?
If dress is in good taste, doesn't this sound ridiculous?  I
think so too.  So, what to do?  I don't know what I'll be
wearing that day, but rest assured it will not be "nice".  Why
challenge the system?

	Why not?

	Think about it.  Can the school place you in a little
room and force you to miss a "fun" (hah) day out of regular
classes if you don't wear nice clothes?  If your clothes are in
good taste, they can NOT.  I don't have the name of a law that
says that, but they can NOT.  So, my mother wondered out loud
what this "Stand By Me Day" that she'd been hearing about was.
I told her the gist of what I planned on doing.  She said "Why
are you doing this, just to rebel?  What's wrong with
conformity?"  (Except she used many more words to say basically
that.)  If everyone were like my mom, we'd all be doing whatever
the school wanted.  My decision to challenge this is not going
to be popular.  But I feel it necessary to stand up for myself.
And, if I do get placed in this little room this Friday, who
knows.  You might read about this in the newspapers sometime
soon.  Yeah, I'm a publicity seeking weasel.  But, I'm
challenging something that I see as unfair.  Not everyone can
say that.
