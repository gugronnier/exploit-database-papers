                       Ethical Nihilism
                       ----------------

We had known collectively or perhaps just had the inklings that we
were wrong.  We longed for a consistency that would justify, perhaps
even vindicate ourselves, our opinions, our thoughts, our attitudes,
and most importantly, our actions and activisms.

We patted ourselves on our backs because //we were intellectuals//,
we understood the technical infrastructures, the techniques, and
our treasured technicalities.  We knew deeply that we were superior
in a non-intrinsical fashion, because we didn't bother with material
quests -- maybe we were communists, but we most certainly weren't
pragmatists.

Or were we?  We were!  ...but need we tell anyone?  After all, it was
a game; this maxim is still true.  But we betrayed ourselves when we
pretended that deception or intellectual superiority, when coupled
with the denial of what is self-evident, if only to us, could ever
be equated with being correct, or, Science-forbid, accurate.

We were wrong in a thoroughly total and absolute fashion.  We were
Wrong, to use a Kafka-esque grandiosity, and our inaccuracy was the
Lie, the Sin, of our ethoi.  It would have been easy to make another
rationalization, the eternal //ad populum//, or somesuch.  We were
wrong but we did not move on //because there was no right//.  We called
'right' and 'wrong' metaphysical, artificial, synthetic, Puritanical,
Aristotelian, Zoroastrian, culture-dependant, relative.  Our 'wrong' 
meant inconsistent.  We were logical, but we did not see that right and 
wrong were transcended by our philosophies.  Indeed, the transcendance 
was much deeper and much more complicated than we could imagine.

When we threw 'right' and 'wrong' out the window, so went guilt.  Not
in the sense of shame, or at least not for this example, but the sort
of legal guilt, the kind that breaks knees and boils the blood of
condemned prisoners without appeals.

As 'scientific' atheists, we were condemned to a sort of determinism-
without-determinism.  It wasn't necessary that we ignore uncertainty
principles and physicist jargon in order to see what we saw.  Our ideas
were not limited to current quantum-mechanical knowledge, because,
//as humans are neither muons nor photons//, the only question was
the validity of the soul archetype.  Again, we were scientific atheists.
Thus, absent any divinely-derived independance, we curiously came back
to the Christian message - crime is just a social interaction.

All is the Great Vestigial of a new age, and we are the Great 
Anthropologists.
