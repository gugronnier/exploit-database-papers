                           Nighthawk's Ramblings
                           ---------------------

        The following are excerpts from letters received from 
Nighthawk written to Damanstian. Segments of the letters are
quoted here-after, regarding several different aspects of the government
and organizations. The following was typed by Dam, so all typos
are his fault.

"Have you ever wanted to see an entire class of people annihilated
in a fiery holocaust? I am currently feeling that way about hippies.
Or at least the wannabe variety I am currently surrounded with. If I 
see one more Grateful Dead shirt, I'm going to get a heavy machine gun 
and blast as many as possible before I am cut down in the crossfire of
imcompetant ATF agents armed with the kind of firepower they would deny
to the citizens of this nation. Just to make things absolutely clear,
I am vehemently anti-gun control. I have heard the argument that the
"well-regulated militia" mentioned in the 4th Amendment is the National
Guard or the local police forces! As anyone who has bothered to research 
the subject knows, the militia is intended to prevent the government from
becoming oppressive, as well as to assist in the defense of the nation if
our borders were to be overrun. However, later laws allowed for the
nationalization of the state-organized National Guard Units, whereby
they could be controlled by the executive or legislative branches,
thereby becoming a tool of oppression rather than a shield against it!
And as far as police defending our rights, I have a severe lack of 
confidence. The Fraternal Order of Police, a nationwide union for police
officers, has consistently lobbied legislators at all levels from city to
federal to restrict as many of our personal freedoms as possible.
They have tried to take away our rights to freedom from unreasonable
search and seizure, the right to keep and bear arms, the rights to operate
various vehicles, the right to a fair trial, and the right to avoid double 
jeopardy. Also, remember having to register for Selective Service? This 
makes it possible for the United States government to draft you, train 
you, arm you with an assault rifle, and send you to be slaughtered by 
veteran troops of a foreign nation if the political leadership of the 
nation digs itself too deeply into a policy hole(which is happening in 
the Arkansas White House as we speak). Where are the Lee Harvey Oswalds 
of the world when you really need them? Let's ask the military-industrial 
complex!"

"I wonder if somebody's reading your mail? has Big Brother finally taken 
control of our country? It seems to me that the right and left, politically 
speaking, are distinguished only by the specific wording of their attempts 
to enslave the population. The right wants to strip minors of all rights,
make it illegal to possess any substance not sponsored by a huge lobby like 
R.J. Reynolds or the alcohol industry, and take away your free access to any 
information you might want to have. The left wants to take away your rights
to free speech in the name of political correctness, your right to make your 
own path in life with bloated entitlement programs, and your right to keep
the money you have earned with massive tax encreases caused by their love of 
Big Government, bloated bureaucracies, and handouts of all forms. Leave me
the fuck alone, you Brooks Brothers-suited Gestapo bastards! People convicted
of selling a quarter-ounce of post spend more time in jail than rapists,
armed robbers, or, in some cases, murderers! Yet I cannot legally carry
a handgun for self-defense until I am twenty-one, and must wait from five
days to three weeks to buy any gun. In the meantime, the crack addict who 
wants to kill me and steal my possessions has just bought a submachine gun 
off the back of a truck and is heading towards my house with a full clip of 
Black Talon rounds (which only the police and federal agencies can legally 
possess-for what purpose I don't know) with the intention of getting whitey 
for his oppression. Or at least that's what Jesse Jackson, Al Sharpton, and 
Louis Farrakhan have told him."

"I find that the most radical thing to rebel against is the status quo
of 'rebellion' embraced by every Sunchild, hippie, and loser in the
world. I piss more people off by appearing to be more completely 
conservative than Abbie Hoffman and H. Rap Brown did in their leftist 
heydays. It's amazin how insecure people really are--the best way to
destroy someone these days is to suggest that they stop whining and just
fucking do something with their lives."

"Isn't it about time we allowed natural selection to take its course?
I mean, how much longer are we going to support useless human beings like
welfare junkies, crack addicts, and the Senate? Anarchist--it's not
just a job, it's an adventure."
