                      What are you going to do?  Shoot me?
                      ------------------------------------

     It seems that more and more when I get into a disagreement with someone
about something and they always have to say "What are you going to
do?  Shoot me?" I know then that the discussion is going nowhere.  I own a
gun, a 9mm Baretta.  People seem to have this image from a movie that when
somebody disagrees with a person with a gun they get shot.  I am not someone
that carries a gun with me all the time and it isn't like I illegally have it.
I own it and have registered it with the government.  I do carry it on me when
I know I will be out late or driving in a certain part of town.  I am not a
gun fanatic or someone that has to have a gun to feel secure.  Still whenever
anyone anywhere gets in an argument with me about the smallest thing they
always say "What are you going to do? Shoot me?"

     This really gets annoying and seems to be a cheap shot of sorts. I have
never threatened anyone with a gun nor have I even pulled it in self defense.
It is added security when I know that I will be out late or in a bad side of
town.  If I was to get into a fight or any other physical confrontation I can
handle myself with out a gun.  Now whenever anyone says or mentions my gun as
a way of myself being a man I think of how uncomfortable it must be for them
to know that I own a firearm.  I think that the media in our society portrays
people that own guns as either gang bangers or people that need to resort to
violence as a mean to solve their difficulties.  It seems now society sees
gun owners as people that are outcasts, it seems almost like an elite
social crime to own a gun.

     It is also perceived that peoples own fear of being shot plays a roll in
this as well. They believe by saying this to me that I won't shoot them
because they do not fear me.  I know that this is reading into the way that
people think, but when you hear a comment so many times you must wonder to
yourself "Why does he keep saying this."  I know that most likely this FUCK
file will not be published because of the editor, but I know that this is
something that I needed to get off of my chest.  People need to learn that not
everyone that owns a gun will go nuts and then shoot anyone that has ever
disagreed with them.  A gun, like pepper spray is a method of self-defense,
it can be used to be an offensive weapon.  The first thing they teach you when
you buy your gun is "Don't point it at someone unless you intend on using it."
I think that people that have this complex against regular people like myself
having a gun needs to learn what that phrase means, not "What are you going to
do? Shoot me?"
