                                Death of ...
                                ------------

        The Internet died over a year and a half ago. There is no one to
blame. Oh yes, many of you would love to point your fingers at NCSA for
creating Mosiac, or at AOL for allowing some of the stupidest beasts known
to this planet on the Internet. We would all love to point the finger, it
makes us feel better for what we have done. You, pointing your finger at
the imagined demons of the destruction, You, who sits at your Windoze
terminal with 2 copies of Netscrape open and Eudorla sucking down your
email. Do not give in to the hypocrisy, it will do you no good. The
Internet as I once knew it is dead. We are now witnessing the rebirth
of a new Internet, a user friendly Internet, just point and click your
way to salvation.
	This Internet will be your gateway to a digital heaven where no
one will have to leave their homes for anything. Just open up your web
browser and order a pizza for dinner and go shopping for groceries at the
same time. Your whole house will be a point and click operation. Click,
lights on, Click, door open, Click , preheat to 450. You will sit back and
get fat on your new found technology, you who two years ago thought
computers were for mathematicians and geeks in acounting firms. Oh yes,
you will think you have the world at your fingertips.  My gosh, you are so
smart. You have browsing the web down to a science and you can send email
to anyone at the click of a button. Do you know how any of this "neat
stuff" works? Do you know "why" when you click that button your lights in
your house turn on? Do you know how your money is transferred from the
bank to that pizza joint when you ordered that pizza? No. You think you
don't need to. Damn, if it breaks I will just call that computer guy over 
here and have him fix it. "Why should I have to know why any of this 
stuff does what it should? "There are guys who do this stuff for a living 
that make it work perfectly, and if it didn't work right, then they 
wouldn't have released it."

        In 10 years you will be hooked into a life support system
connected to the Internet so that the doctor can check your progress while
he is at home spending quality time with his family. You will lie in that
hospital bed, thinking to yourself "I am in the best hands, I am in a
hospital, surrounded by the best doctors in the world, I feel safe." All
of a sudden all the machines in your room stop operating and the IV drip
you have going into your arm speeds up. You try to call out for help but
you can't , there's nobody around. But wait, there is someone with you,
deep inside the humming of the machines that surround you. It's one of
those "computer guys", you know, the ones you called when your mouse
locked up or your screen saver wouldn't work. When they left, you would
always exclaim to yourself "what a geek that guy was, he must have no life."
Guess what, he just turned off the respirator and wrote the words
"Deceased" on your e-medical file. Maybe in your next life you'll realize
how naive you had been about the people who control technology.
