                                I'm Gonna Sue

        I'm gonna sue.  I'm gonna sue the restaurant I ate lunch at 
last week.  Their soup was too hot and burned my tongue.  Better 
yet, I'll sue the company that makes that dangerous soup.  They 
should have warned me and prevented my injury.  I'll sue Bic, the 
company that makes the lighters I use.  I burned my finger on one 
just the other day.  They should pay me for my suffering.  
I should sue the company that manufactures my cigarettes too.  If 
it weren't for their addictive product, I wouldn't have used that 
dangerous lighter in the first place.  I am an innocent victim, I 
say, and I'm gonna sue.

        Bullshit.  That's all people do these days.  Sue for their 
pain and suffering, work missed, time off, emotional crises, blah
blah, blah.  If you can't get them on criminal charges, bring up a 
civil suit.  You're sure to win one way or the other.  Look at the 
lady who bought hot coffee from McDonald's.  She's rich now because 
she burned herself on a beverage that is supposed to be hot, and if 
it weren't, she would have bitched about that, too.  Of course, you 
make more money when you get hurt.  Bad service is just something one 
uses to get a free meal.  She made money off the fact that she herself 
possessed no common sense.  "I'll put this steaming hot coffee between 
my legs while I drive.  Of course it won't spill when I take that one 
nasty corner."  Stupid.

        Now the compnay that made the fertilizer used in the Oklahoma 
City bombing is getting sued.  What's wrong with this picture?  Yes, it 
is an explosives company, true.  But this suit insinuates that, had it 
not been for this _particluar_  brand of fertilizer, no lives would 
have been lost, no bombs would have been made.  Yeah, right.  You can 
use all sorts of neat little household materials to make bombs, and 
other fertilizers as well.  So these people truly think that if it 
weren't for _this_ fertilizer none of this would have happened?  Of 
course they don't.  The bomb would have gone off no matter what type of
explosive  materials were used.  The people responsible for this 
incident wanted it to happen.  The trick is this: Send the criminals 
to jail to get emotional satisfaction and sue the company to get 
financial satisfaction.  After all, the victims should get something 
out of this right?

        Wrong.  Why does a victim "deserve" anything?  All these 
victims have a huge impact on our lives, but no one ever thinks about 
that.  With some companies, you can sue them for a million dollars 
and it is pocket change.  For others, even a thousand dollars would 
cause ruin.  All these bullshit lawsuits do nothing except make 
a victim happy (and rich) and the company scared to do anything anymore.  
Sometimes even prices must be raised, jobs can be lost.  Doctors 
won't do certain types of surgery anymore because of malpractice 
fears, and precious lives are lost.  And why?  Because someone got 
hurt or things didn't go they way they wanted them to, and they said, 
"I'm gonna sue."

        Certainly not all civil suits are groundless or a waste of time 
or money.  I am certain that many people out there who choose to sue 
an institution or an individual have a good reason to do so.  What I 
am saying is that people need to wake up and realize that mistakes 
and accidents happen.  They are a part of life.  Compnies cannot control 
who uses their products and how they are used.  It is impossible to 
monitor their clientele that closely.  That woman who bought the hot 
coffee should have realized that sometimes liquids spill while you are 
in a moving vehicle so one should be careful.  And if it does spill, 
so what?  It was an accident.  How far can you take all of this?  I'm
pretty sure that if the man who invented explosives were still alive,
the Oklahoma City victims would have sued him too.  More money, more
press coverage, more reward for their suffering.  That's the name
of the lawsuit game.  More is better, less is none.

        I am going to close with a little story about a woman who could 
have sued and won, but didn't.  A lady in her thirties got into a major 
accident and had both of her feet cut off at the ankles.  She was 
rushed to the emergency room and her feet were successfully reattached.  
A few days later, they realized that they had been attached to the wrong 
legs.  Now, this woman could have sued the hospital and its staff for 
millions of dollars and most certainly would have ended up with quite 
a hefty settlement.  But she didn't do it.  Why not?  She said, "I'm so 
happy to be able to walk, who cares if my feet look a little funny?  I 
know it was an accident." Due to an opertaing room error, this young woman 
is literally deformed for life.   Now isn't this a little worse than 
getting burned by hot coffee?   _You_ think about it.
