                          --------------

I cannot remember the time that I last typed something, just for the fun of
typing, or for the fun of or writing it.  Nowadays, if I do not have something
to type that has a purpose, in some way, it's not typed.  The same goes
nowadays for things I say ... I remember hearing once, that someone judges
whether or not they will believe or take what you say and remember it,
within the first five seconds of hearing what you are saying.  That's a
quick judgement, with very little to go on, but I really think a lot of
times it is true.

Instead of times when you could sit and talk about anything or everything,
now unless you have something 'worth while' to say, it's pointless to talk.
And, you are lucky if you can even get someone to read or hear what you are
saying, much less pay attention or listen.

Then once in a great long while, you find someone that you can actually sit
and talk with about anything and everything.  You are comfortable with
sharing something serious, and you are not afraid to say something silly.  It
is a rarity and something of a bond, if you correspond somehow with someone
that way.

In a world that judges you so quickly, even before you can say anything or
type anything ... it amazes me, that any of us get to half the places that we
are going in life.

Ramblings and babblings, are sometimes pointless and boring, other times its
a peak through a window to a persons heart, that otherwise would neverly,t afrae'  uswld  to half the pny, it'u, even bebblinbyhimemeanmetimestheinspiraen.re gen
