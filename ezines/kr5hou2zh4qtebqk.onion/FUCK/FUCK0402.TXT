                    A Few Things That Annoy Ruth
                    ----------------------------

I'm a fucking Nut.  Yeah I think that about sums it up.  I'm a bloody
lunatic. I'm psychotic. I'm strange. I'm weird.  Why?  Because if you ask
me, I'm the most mentally balanced person you'll probably ever meet.  Ask
anyone who knows me.  They'll tell you I'm annoying as shit most the time,
completely immature, and never fucking serious.  Know what I think about
that?  Not a damn thing.  So what?
	My question is, what the fuck is wrong with the world.  I see
people running around all day long, moping, complaining, whining, and just
plain hating life.  "oooohhh I am so full of angst!"  What the fuck is the
problem here?  Lets look a few things.  In fact, let start with everyone's
personal favorite, Depression!  
	I love depression.  It's such a wonderful way to relax.  I'm
clinically diagnosed as a Manic depressive.  Know what that means?  It
means my shrink is an idiot.  Good thing I was going to him for free.
College is neat that way.  Either way, don't try to tell me I don't know
what it is then, about every 3 months I spend 2-3 days laying on my bed
staring at the walls without the energy to get up.  My friends get
worried, my girl gets frantic, and my rat kept me company.  The funny
thing is, I enjoy it.  Actually, strike that, I love it.  No, it's not the
attention.  To be honest, that really gets on my nerves.  Most the time I
just want to be left alone.  It's the silence.  When it happens I actually
get some peace and quiet in this head of mine.  I can just lay there, near
comatose, and not think of anything.  Nothing at all.  It's all empty.
It's actually beautiful.  I relax and lay there for a while and when I'm
done I get up and I feel refreshed.  But then again I guess that's
physical depression, not mental depression.  Whatever it is.  It's pretty
nice.  My question for the depressed masses is "if you're so fucking
depressed, why the fuck don't you at least attempt to enjoy the
depression! It does wonders for your soul!"  yeah it's kind of an oxymoron,
"happy depression," but at least it's more fun.
	Hrm... what's next?  Oh yes... persecution.  Everyone I know is
getting persecuted for something.  They hate me because I'm a "insert word
here." What is going on in this world that suddenly we all hate each
other?  Know what I think?  I don't think anything has changed.  People
have hated each other ever since some monkey picked up a tree branch and
beat the shit out of another for a piece of girl monkey ass.  The simple
fact of the matter is that now our government gives perks and prizes to
anyone who says they've been dicked with by someone else.  So now it's
cool to be hated.  Oh boy.  That's some logic for you... I've never seen
so many people so happy and proud of the fact that someone disliked them
that they would tell everyone they met all about it.   "no really Dave, I
didn't get that promotion because I'm a black female jew lesbian.  I think
I'm going to sue."  No really... I'm honestly sure that's it.  Maybe you just
aren't qualified.  Or maybe that really is it.  But if it is, do you wanna
work for that asshole that didn't hire you anyway?  I look at that shit
and think, if I were in that position I'd have to tell Dave.  "You know
Dave, that guy really fucked up... I would've given his wife the best piece
of kosher chocolate pussy she's ever had and he could've fucking watched."
But then again, I'm strange that way.
	That's just a few of my thoughts.  When I bring this shit up, a
lot of people tell me. "you don't know what your talking about."  "You
don't know how things really are." "You can't laugh at everything." And
"Life's not all fun and games."  Well I got one thing to say about that.
Fuck that shit.  I know what's out there... I've seen my share of shit and
filth and all in all crappy things.  I've been there.  I've also been else
where.  But fuck it all if you can't laugh at it.  Life is too short not
to have a good time.  What have we got?  An average of 85 years or so?
For those of you who are reading this, probably significantly less.
You'll probably get enough radiation from that monitor in your face to fry
your brain by 60.  But so what.   At least you'll surf enough porn to keep
you busy in the afterlife.      Whatever time you have here is so limited
you had better fucking enjoy it, because let me tell you something.  When you
die.  There's no guarantees.  Religion is stupid.  It's empty promises.
No one knows what's going to happen.  You either go someone else when you
die, or you don't.  if you don't, then every last one of you that spent all
your time moping around, complaining and hating the whole thing are
screwed.  You got your one chance and you blew it.  You didn't make it fun.
If we do get lucky and there is an afterlife (as fucking improbable as it
seems) you may get screwed again.  My personal opinion is when I die I'm
going to end up in an eternal orgy with so many naked chicks my eyes are
going to pop out.  But then again, I'm hoping, not trusting in it.  So
fucking smile, have a nice day, and get one with your god damn life.
Enjoy yourself and quit crying.

Sorry about that folks.  I was in the mood to rant.  Maybe that will make
some sense to one of you, though i can't say it made too much sense to me.
