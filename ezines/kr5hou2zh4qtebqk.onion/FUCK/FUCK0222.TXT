                           The Roots of Tragedy
                           --------------------

    "Tragedy is a representation essentially not of men but of human action; 
of human life, its happiness and misery...and the proper end of dramatic 
representation therefore is a mode of action, not some sort of quality."
   -Aristotle, _Poetics_

    It seems that for the vast majority of Americans, life is good.  Most of
us live in nice houses, have enough to eat, are warm in the winter, and
basically lead good lives.  Yet, there is a huge portion of the population
that is basically unhappy.  They are easy to find.  Walk into a Denny's or
some other cheap restaurant - there are people, usually middle-aged or older,
who sit completely alone and eat silently.  This is probably a treat to them,
they probably don't eat out often, and yet they do not look happy.  Of
course, these people are not confined to bad restaurants.  They will usually
hold some unskilled job.  They are your bus drivers, your grocery baggers, 
your janitors, your factory workers.  You probably see someone like this 
every day.  You have probably never said a word to this person, don't even
know their name.  But maybe you wonder what their life is like, why they
never say anything to you, why they look so unhappy most of the time.

    I ride the same bus twice a day, five days a week.  I know the driver on
sight, I would recognize him walking down the street, and yet I do not know
his name.  I have never heard him speak.  He does not look happy.  If I was 
a busdriver, maybe I would be depressed too.  It seems likely.  Maybe this
is what makes me wonder about this man.

    Aristotle says that the purpose of tragedy is to evoke pity and fear;
more specifically pity for a good man who has fallen, and fear at the fate
of a man like ourselves.  Modern life in the big city is a tragedy.  I pity
these people: downtrodden, kicked around, miserable, and yet they are what
keeps our lives smoothly running.  Where would we be without our unskilled,
unhappy workers?  And yet, it troubles me that one day I may end up like
my bus driver.  This is not a bad person, this is someone like you or me.  By
many standards his life is good.  And yet, I would not want to be in his
shoes.  But it seems likely that I may end up there, driving that bus, 
pushing that mop, coming home to an empty house and maybe going out to
Denny's a couple times a month.  If my bus driver dies, the only thing I will
notice is a different face behind the wheel.  Hundreds of people may notice,
and not one will really care.  Just another sad-faced, lower-middle-class,
city-dwelling bus driver.  Just as long as I get there on time.

    I believe that I can avoid this destiny, but, it really comes down fate.
Nonetheless, I hope this tragedy can motivate me to action, before it becomes
too late.
