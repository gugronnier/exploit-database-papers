[Editor's note: Hey!  Another /<-RaD chat log!!!  W0w!!!!!  It's between me

------------------------------------

why do you think you should get access here?

Why not? I managed access on boards more scared of the SPA than U...

[Hmm.. the SPA... "Hi.. I'm a WaReZ d00d!!!"]

why would you think I'm afraid of the SPA?  Are you some sort of warez lamer

no, but i am aware of some...What do you have to offer? U've been sort of
non-descipt?maybe?

huh?  You sound.. er... lemme ask you this: where did you get DFS?

I'm not stoned, just really, tired. I got it off a board.

yeah.. that helps.  Most people tend to get it off of boards these days..
what one is what I'm asking

Major Destuction        [A lame board in 414]

I see... I suppose you know a lot about H/P right?

depends. what do you want to know?

well I assume you know like the basics of switching right?

yeah.

do you ever beige?

not yet. all i've done is red, blue and silver(i think it was silver.) I'm
doing lunch right now...

[Eating lunch or using lunch boxes?]

silver is with A B C and D keys.. what NPA did you do it off of.. I heard
that it's pretty tough now.

no, it wasn't silver...not urine...i don't remember. What's that one where
you open the canister and hook up call waiting or a tap?

[Seems that he's just reading off box names now..]

blotto?

no, i couldn't afford the generators...

[At least he knows what THAT is!]

green then I think.

I don't have them all memorized. I'll get back to you.

[Yeah after he reads all of his /<-RaD t3x7 F1l3Zzzzzzz!!!]

ok.. well when you blue boxed.. did you do it from your house?

one minute...I have to take a leak...

ok... hurry up though.

[He is now dropping to DOS and looking through all of his blue box text to see
what a blue box does.]

no...Pennsylvania when they still had that system with 2600...

[He's probably never even left the state.... that system with 2600.  I bet I
have that text file somewhere.]

oh you mean the 7ess switch right?

[Not that 7ess exists but...]

You're in America, now boy, speak Spanish!

[Well.. he's totally lost now.]

er... yeah.. ok.. anyway.. so do you ever hack?

hack what? boards, or do you mean crack?

nah.. not cracking.. hacking like .. oh hacking your local university's
computer system or something.

The only uni i've done is Marquette. I heard UW's easy, but I have no use for
that.

[Marquette is a university in 414.  It was totally hacked by everyone, it ran
SunOS.  They discovered this and changed to System V.  People still hack it.
UW is the University of Wisconsin, a whole system actually.  UWM (UW Milwaukee)
is what he's talking about.  The system is a LOT better than Marquette's.  The
run Ultrix.]

ahh... did you hack SYSSTUD?

[Testing his intellegence.. real name of the system is StudSys.]

no, i didn't spend much time locally. All i've done is Foley&Larder once,
Marquette, low-level ummm you know what, and Nick Ovens pathetic board.

[Low-level what?  Formatting???]

Nick Ovens??

he's some faggot who has his very own board. He's younger than ME even.

[This Sandman guy is 14 BTW.]

wow.. have you ever played with PSNs?

psn's?

Packet Switching Networks

No, I've never used a psn.

But you have InterNet access right?

yep.

cool.. do you ever go on IRC?

no, i haven't explored it much yet. Can u get on the internet from UWM?

why do you ask?

I think you can...maybe I should try that. Now i have a reason...

a reason for what?

hacking UWM

what?  To hack my accounts?

who said anything about your accounts, why, do you go there?

of course not.  I'm only in high school.  I get my accounts other ways.

[All the truth.  He's probably drooling now...]

interesting. know any SuperUser passwords?

all of them.  why?

[Now he's probably spitting all over the keyboard and screen..]

can i have one? make my life easier...

what do I get in return?

[Why'd I even ask this?  He can't offer anything.]

what do you want...ask and ...nevermind, I can't spell that word...

well.. have you broken any Sys75's?

I gave you my short list before...

hhmmm... well... dunno... here I'll give you a password..I don't really need
them.. lemme quickly drop to DOS and check my list...  ok... here's one:
107321404

[Yeah.. 107321404... also seen in 10732-1-404-988-9664... an ANI readback.]

thatz Uwm SU?

one of a few.

neat..no, better than neat...saved me a night's work...

[Yeah.... a night... sure...]

well. it's not too hard to get SU passwords.. it took me like 10 minutes to
figure that one out.  The others took a bit longer.

Do you have a snake that actually works?

a few..

I have one DeMon that is not worth shit...I had to almost totally reprogram
it...

[A snake???  What's that anyway?]

you program?

Enough to get along in Pascal, C(++), Basic,Logo,Cobol, Fortran, and a little
ADA

[Hmm.. ok.. Pascal, C, Basic and Logo MAYBE I can believe.  I doubt he knows
Pascal or C though.. or very little at most.  COBOL.. Common Business Oriented
Language... FORTRAN... maybe he's some scientist?  ADA.. oh.. now I get it!  He
works for the DoD!!!]

that's pretty good.. do you know assembler?

oh, rats, you found the missing link, did you...no, but as soon as I find
someone, something, or some phile, I'll learn.

[Learn it from a file.. oh sorry... PHile.  Yeah.. he's never heard of it
probably.]

cool.. do you ever do any OOP?

stop using the abbreveitions.

OOP=Object Oriented Programming.. I'd type the whole thing but OOP is a lot
easier to do.

Yes. I've used that, in fact, I'm stumbling through making a game.

sounds cool.. well it's been nice chatting with you... have you read most of
the DFSs?

no. I ran out of DL credit. I only got a few. They're pretty damn
awful/annoying/cool if I do say so myself...

yeah.. I guess .. well watch for some new ones really soon.  I might even
mention you in one.

[You're reading it now!]

Why? (what have i done now...)

well no.. you know a lot of stuff. I was going to do one where I'd talk about
all the new talent that's popping up in this area code.

(moment of silence)...I'm flattered...

[He feels good now.]

yep.. well I'll let you go now.  Call back in two or three days and I should
have your account ready.


How old are U?

[Getting a bit personal now.. but I don't care.]

17

...Do you use C?

Nope.  I know a bit, but I mostly program in Pascal.

Pascal is dead, long live C...

yeah I know.. that's why I'm learning C and SmallTalk right now.

[It's the truth.  Idolize me or something.]

cool. R U running Unix or Dos?

I'm running DOS.

hmmm. Do you have a Cddrive or tape drive for you BBS?

why would I need one?  It's not like people are running warez through here

jeez...get off the warez thing...I just like to keep EVERYTHING i have ever
had, so I wondered if otherz were having similar Harddisk space
problems...(then again I only have 200megs anyway)

[Yeah.. I mentioned it.. once before?]

yeah.. I guess... it tends to get a bit cramped sometimes.. but I live with
it.

Do you play computer games or have you <outgrown> it?:)

sometimes.. but not often.

what do you play

oh.. all sorts of stuff.

Space Quest 5?

yeah that's a great game.

[Never even seen a screen from it.  I played Space Quest 3 for a couple minutes
once.. and I actually though Space Quest 1 was pretty k-rad.]

have you beat it?

nah.. I'm not that good.

need help?

not right now.. I like to figure stuff out on my own.

yeah...well, can I sign on to your magnificent board?

[Butt kissing never gets you anywhere...]

you'll have to wait.. I won't be able to get your account ready for like a
day or two.

[When I get around to deleting it..]

alright.

ok. c'ya.. and look for new dfs's real soon!

C-Ya...alt-h

[Shit.. I haven't seen people type alt-h to say good bye for... months.]

[Pretty funny eh?  Now he's probably going to start some sort of "Ban Access
Denied from your board and crash Paradise Lost" movement or something.  Like I
care... I have his 1nPh0!!!!!  Bahahaha!!!!!!! Haha... anyway... that's a funny
chat!!! Ahh...... bite me.]
