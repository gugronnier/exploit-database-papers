Taking advantage of phonton waves       By: The Butcher

Critics: (cr) "Phonton waves?!? You mean photon waves right?"

The Butcher (tb) No dumbass, I mean what I say.

tb: Phonton waves are on a special waveleignth, they are your everyday cordless
    and celluar phone calls.

cr: "Yeah, whatever, now will you get to the point! I want hacking tips and
    ways to get shit for free."

tb: Shut up and listen! Phonton waves are found between 45.00Mhz & 49.99Mhz
    for SHITTY cordless phones (greets to Access Denied ;-) and 145.00Mhz to
    about 155.00 for Cellular Phones.

cr: "Well, I turned the knob on my radio until it broke off but couldn't
    get to any of the frequencys you were talking about. Am I doing somthing
    wrong?"

tb: Yes. You must buy an all-band radio, found at most ham shacks and in
    the back of magazines about shortwave radio (don't know of any names
    off hand) I suggest an I-COM for ease of use, reliability and many
    features. A good one will recieve 1Khz-999.99Mhz Cost varies between
    $200-$800 depending on the features you want. I bought mine for about
    $400 and it's one that can be mounted in a car or used as portable.

cr: "Well, I just blew my insurance, car payments, 2 month's salary, coledge
    fund and killed my parents for the will. Should I sell my soul also and
    buy an antenna so tall I can pick up the mars observer?"

tb: Nope just regular antenna wire (25-50 ft.) connected to a male coaxel jack.
    (If you don't know the difference between male and female ports just D/L
    some .GIF's and find out.)

cr: "O.K. now I got it all hooked up and running. Now what good does this
    do?"

tb: Use the output port to go to your tape deck and begin recording and set
    the radio to continous scan for your pre-set freq's. Then go off to school,
    work, all-day porn fest or even midnight viewings of the Rockey Horror
    Picture Show at the Oriental (a 4i4 thing). At the end of the day or after
    you have sobered up review the tapes. Try to get one of those old reel
    thingeys because a tape only holds up to 3hrs. Or else you could use a
    VCR.

cr: "Well, now I can review:Phone sex calls, miscelanious phone calls to the
    FBI about me and my computer and neighbors complaining to cops about my
    loud music. What am I looking for?"

tb: Four sets of four numbers, an experation date, a name and keywords like:
    Mastercard, Visa, Discover, Optma, Catre Blanche, Diner's Club and
    American Express.

cr: "Wow! I can make this radio pay for itself! But I have one problem, I keep
    hearing static-like noise on my radio what can I do?

tb: Well turn up the squelch and if the problem persists go find an acoustic
    coupler and try running it through a dumb termnal (Don't ask me how I don't
    know.)
