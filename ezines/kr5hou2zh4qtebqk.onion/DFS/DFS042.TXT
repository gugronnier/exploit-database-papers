  8 months ago, I was a disaster. I was on one elite board that carried mainly
warez and ran VBBS.. I didn't know what H/P/A/C/V stood for, nor did I know
the names of more then two virii. Hello, my name is Bloodmoney, and I am a
lamer.

  I knew I needed help, but I wasn't sure where to turn to, who to talk to..
I tried to pull myself out of the gutter but it was hard. Finally I called
United Way. United Way reffered me to a group called Lamers Anonymous. Lamers
Anonymous has helped me get on my feet. They provided me with helpful
information, acronyms, etc. They also set rules for me. For instance, I was
not allowed to spend more then 1 hour on a pd board a day and I wasn't allowed
to download /<-R4[) 3l33+3 W4R3Z.

  Here I am, 8 months later, I have my own group and am a member of several
others. I have my own elite board. However, I still attend meetings regularly,
but now, as a volunteer. I want to do everything I can to help lamers like me
get their lives together. I owe my life to former Lamers like myself who
helped me get my act together. I just want to be a part of someone else's
life.
