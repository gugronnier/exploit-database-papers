             The Intro To DAMNED FUCKING SHIT!!!

     Hey.  This is the intro file to DFS - Damned Fucking Shit.
Obviously it's an attempt at some sort of a magazine.  Well, I know
it won't be as huge as Phrack, but hell, why not.  The main purpose
is to just have some sort of a magazine.  Anything will be printed
in it pretty much.  H/P/A/V/C/T/C/P/etc stuff, WaReZ d00d stuff,
Sick story stuff, pretty much anything.  And anyone can write for
it too.  Just submit the story to the DFS WHQ (if you're on it,
it's Paradise Lost in 414).  If you're not on it, contact the
editor, Access Denied (NOT THE GROUP!  Maybe I'll write a story on
that some day... who knows) and if he (well, me) likes it, it'll
get published.  Wow!  You're name gets to be in a DFS Issue!!!!!
Happy Happy Joy Joy!  I really hope you HATE this magazine.
Really!  It's made to just be there and sit there and annoy you.
If you're a sysop, feel free to have this on your BBS.  I don't
care if it's H/P or WaReZ d00d or CoNSoLe d00D or whatever.  It's
your waste of HD space.  So please don't alter these though.
That's about all I ask.  But if you like it for some reason, tell
Access Denied (NOT THE GROUP) and he'll give you A LIFE TIME
SUBSCRIPTION TO LIFE MAGAZINE!  Well, actually I'll... er.... he'll
say something like "Oh.  Yah.  Well if you like it, write for it!"
Maybe if someone REALLY REALLY REALLY wants it they can be a distro
site for DFS.  Of course NO ONE FROM 414! (If you're not in 414 you
can probably figure out that this 'zine is from 414.  Yes folks,
414.  Milwaukee WI.  Shitland.  Home of the... well who cares.)
But If you want to be a distro site I guess you should get in touch
with me... er Access Denied (NOT THE GROUP!)  I'm taking a chance
at this.  I HATE most people in 414 and I DON'T WANT THEM CALLING
MY BBS!  But... I'll give the number *AND* (yes people, AND) the
NUP.  Now just a warning:  If you are from 414, FORGET ABOUT
CALLING!  I had Wonko The Sane from 414 try to get on after he KNEW
he wouldn't get on.  I DON'T want that you 414ers!  DON'T EVEN
THINK ABOUT GETTING ON!!!  And if you wanna write for this and
you're from 414 and not on Paradise Lost, email it to me.  Duh.
Ok... the BBSs # is 414.476.3181.  And the NUP, if I have one, is
LOST BUT FOUND...    Now remember, the ... is PART OF THE
NUP!!!!!!!  IF YOU'RE FROM 414 you NEVER READ THAT AND YOU WON'T
CALL!  I mean it!  Ok, this is too long already!  So read DFS!
Burn DFS!  Insult DFS!  Don't alter DFS!  Bye
