                             Killer

A dashing blow to the head.
Now I'm sure that he is dead.
I brought his life to an end.
Never thought he was a friend.
Now he's gone and I am free,
To continue on my killing spree.

                             Spider

Little Miss Muffet sat on a tuffet,
Easting her curly hair.
Along came a roach and sat on her broach,
And said "Hey, how's it going?"

                              Death

Death to you, death to me,
Death to all the fools that flee.
Death to all the fools that stay.
Death to all the fools that pay.
Pay the facist government,
So they cannot pay their rent.
They build a bomb with all the money.
Hell, I guess it's kinda funny.
The bomb explodes and kills us all.
We're dead before we even fall.
Death to you, death to me.
Death to all the fools that flee.

                             Falling

Falling, falling through the sky.
Splat! I hit the ground and die.

                            Tripping

Whoa!  I tripped, I'm in trouble now!
Watch out for the renegade cow!
I'm tumbleing, flipping, falling too.
I plummet right on top of you.
Colors and shapes float past my eyes.
This is one of my better highs.
I'd surely do this again with glee,
Provided that I don't OD.

                               Gun

I put the gu up to my ear,
My mind is full of deadly fear.
I put the gun up to my neck,
I think I am a reject.
I put the gun up to my chest,
Now it's time for me to rest.
I put the gun back to my head,
I'll pull the trigger and I'm dead.

                         I'm Not A Sicko

I'm not a sicko,
I just like to disgust people.
