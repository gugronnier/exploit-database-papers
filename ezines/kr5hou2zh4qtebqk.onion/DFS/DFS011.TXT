       Computer Expert Accused of Damaging Firm's Records

[This was taken from the Milwaukee Journal.  Oct. 28, 1993]
[All comments by Access Denied are in []s]

     A young computer expert left a nasty parting gift the day he
was fired from the W.H. Brady Co. in Glendale, a criminal complaint
alleges.
     Knowing he was about to be canned, he programmed the computer
on a time delay to wipe out the extensive air emissions files he
had been working on, the complaint says.  When he left the building
at 2230 W. Florist Ave., the files were still there.  But when
supervisors checked the next day, they were nowhere to be found.
     Paul Brian Wehland, 22, of 3321 N. Oakland Ave., was charged
Wednesday in Circuit Court under the state's misdemeanor computer
crime statute.  If convicted, he faces up to nine months in jail
and a $10,000 fine.

[I'll look around for the Wisconsin Statutes and publish them when
I find them.]

     Three times after police became involved in the case, Wehland
called company officials and offered to retrieve the data if they
agreed to drop charges the complaint says.

     Another computer specialist was able to find much of the lost
information, which the company is required to provide on a regular
basis to state and federal environmental agencies.  The company has
suffered a $25,000 loss because of the piracy, the complaint says.

[PIRACY?!?!?  Sure.  Piracy... I sure wish these reporters would
actually LEARN something about computer "crime" before they start
to write about it.  Sheesh.]

     W.H. Bradey Co. manufactures and markets magnetic tape and a
wide variety of name plates, labels, signs and other industrial
identification products.

     According to the complaint:
     Wehland is a student at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee.
He was hired by Brady in December 1991 to write a program and input
data regarding the company's air emissions and compliance with the
Clear Air Act.
     On Sept. 28, Wehland's supervisor caught him playing computer
games at work and later loading information from an electronic
bulletin board into the company's computer.

[Wonder what BBS... probably Exec-PC (A HUGE PD/SW BBS in 414 for
all you guys who don't know... 250+ lines... 36+ GB.  Pretty big)
or something.  Or maybe he's actually some big H/P guy and it was
from my BBS.... nah.]

     Fearing he would be fired, Wehland quit the next day, but was
given his job back on Oct. 5 after he apologized.  Two days later
his supervisor caught him writing a resume cover letter on the
computer on company time.
     During the 30 minutes it took the supervisor to speak to a
colleague about the problem and return to fire him, Wehland
programmed the computer to hide the data, he admitted to police.
He would not say why he did it.

[Hmmm... why'd he do it?  Please, I won't even explain why.  Too
much typing time.  Anyway, if you're going to destroy data, don't
be so blunt about it.  Common sense will tell you that.]
