      Hi.  As many of you know, you can get most software on your
local warez board.  But, what if they don't have what you're
looking for?  What if you can't get access?  What if you're low on
credits, with nothing to upload?  Well, I've got the answer.  There
are many ways to get software.  You can steal it, but that takes
skill.  (Besides, it's kinda hard to rip off Microsoft Office :)
You can get it from a friend, but if you can get it from your
friend, why are you reading this?  Anyways...the method I use has
worked 100% of the time..and all you need is the cash to buy the
program (You'll get it back, trust me.) and a friend. (This may be
hard for some of you lamers.)  Anyways, here goes.  You take a walk
down to your local computer store.  Grab what you want, and go buy
it.  SAVE THE RECEIPT.  If you don't save the receipt, you'll never
get your cash back.  Take it home, install it, whatever, and copy
the disks.  You might want to run off a copy of the docs too..If
it's some AD&D game or something.  Then after you've copied them
and gotten everything you need, take a program that marks bad
sectors on disks, and mark a whole shitload (or all) of the
clusters bad.  Or, if this is beyond your knowledge, or you don't
have the program that will do it, take some rubbing alcohol and rub
off some of the disk.  (The inside part for you morons)  Then take
the program, box, dox, etc. back to the place you got it.  Go to
the service desk and tell them "I got this program for a gift, and
disk # whatever is bad.  Can I exchange this for another copy?"
Then take the new program home with ya.  DON'T OPEN IT!  Go down
to the store tomorrow with a friend.  Have them go into the store
with the software and the receipt, go to the service desk and say,
"Hi, I got this for my birthday, and I already have a copy.  Can I
get a refund?  I have the receipt."  The moronic employee will give
you your refund.  Now you have the program you wanted, and your
money back.  It's easy and works.  The only bad thing is, you need
the cash, and if you plan to do this with like CorelDraw! or
something...well...get a job.

Later.
