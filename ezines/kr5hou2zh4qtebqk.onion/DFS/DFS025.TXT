===============================================================================                            Ed Part 2

     A dark alley.  Garbage, rats, homeless people.  A homeless
child walked through the alley, searching for scraps of food.  She
found a rotting banana peel.  The girl picked it up and began to
nibble on it.  The banana was her first piece of food in three
days.  It was a big find.
     Her hair was very dark, very dirty.  Her face was covered with
the same dirt that covered nearly every other part of her body.
She was probably eleven or twelve.  She was lucky to still be
alive.  She had marks of being on the street.  A large scar ran
across her forehead, the results of a fight she had been unlucky
enough to be near.  Her fingers were grossly deformed, having been
nibbled by rats in the freezing cold of winter.  What teeth she had
were brown or black.  She was indeed in poor shape, someone who
should die, and she wanted to die.  Luckily Ed was right around the
corner...
     Yes, Ed had returned!

     "You poor child, come here, I can help you." Ed said to the
girl.  "It must be terrible having to live like you do."
     "Yes.  Please help me." the child replied.

     Ed helped the best he could.  From behind his back he pulled
his weapon of choice, a huge scimitar, so sharp that it had ripped
the head off of a young child just hours before.  It was still
stained with her blood.  Killing was Ed's hobby.  Thirty-five kills
was not the work of an amateur.
     The girl saw the sword.  A look of terror filled her eyes.
She turned to run, but she was weak from not eating.  Before she
had turned half way, her head was on its way to the ground.  She
was quite obviously dead.  In an insane frenzy, Ed began to
mutilate the child's body.  It only took a few slashes to have
eight pieces in front of him instead of two.  The last slash must
have hit something special.  A dark green liquid began to squirt
all over the alley.  It formed into puddles before finally
stopping.  A dog ran up and began lapping at the puddles.  Ed bent
down and picked up the banana peel.  With the tip of his scimitar
he jabbed it through the roof of her mouth into her brain.  He
could see some of the grayish-tan flow through her nose.  The dog
began to nibble at the girl's stomach which was lying on the
ground.  Ed walked off, satisfied with his day.
  "Well, that was number thirty-six.  Two in a day Ed.  You need
some rest.  Well tomorrow's another day..."  Those were Ed's
thoughts as he drifted off to sleep.  Two new decorations were on
his wall.  One with blonde hair, one with dirty black hair.  Ed's
dreams were of tomorrow... "Hmm.. that ugly land-lord of mine is a
real nice guy..."
