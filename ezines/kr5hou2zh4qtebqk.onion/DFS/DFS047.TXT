NOTE FRom DR. H. P. Nominaly.   I as a doctor of many psychological
disoders, have hereby scientifically scrutinized Dr. TEchno under the most
extreme circumstances ever wrought upon a man, and have determined that
Dr. TEchno indeed does not suffer from Meglomania, which has been asserted
by his subject many times before.  He is indeed crazy, but do not hold that
against him, for he has a wealth of knowledge to convey to minds eager to
bask in the glory of his knowledge.

Topic:Defeating Windows and The Evil Sysops.

Many sysops run very crippled versions of windows on their netowrks.
Nothing may frustrate a hacker more when he/she sits down at a terminal
running windwows and tries to drop to dos only to be foiled by disabled
commands, etc.

This is called customized menu access.  For the most part, intelligent
sysops (is there such a thing?) will prevent you from running your own files,
prevent you from exiting windows, and will usually prevent you from modifying
their windwows setup entirely.

Q: How do I get around this Dr. TEchno?

A: Well, it is quite simple.
Most sysops can not make their version of windows totally hack proof.  Why?
Most sysops will leave some form of a word processor in windows.  THis
is especially true at businesses, and at most schools / universities.
Well, you may ask, what good is a word processing system going to do me.
All that I want to do IS HACK HACK HACK!!!!!.  Well, my children, a word
processer will allow you to edit a windows file called PROGMAN.INI.
This awesome ini file contains one nasty section called Restrictions.
Most semi-intelligent sysops love to load up this section with nasties.
All that you have to do is load in this file to the word processor (make
sure you import it and save it in it's native format (ascii) or else you
will create mucho problemos and will more than likely get caught.
Once you have PROGMAN.INI, loaded in, use the following information to your
advantage.

** NoRun = <0 or 1> A setting of 1 disables the File menu's Run command; it
will appear dimmed.

** NoClose = <0 or 1> A setting of 1 disables the File menu's Exit
Window's option so that user's can't exit Windows from the File menu or
by pressing Alt+F4.

** NoFileMenu= <0 or 1> A setting of 1 removes the File Menu from the
Program Manager entirely, disabling access to any of its functions.

** EditLevel= <0 to 4> Zero, the default value, lets users, make changes to
Program Manager.  A setting of 1 prevents users from creating, deleting, or
renaming program groups.  A value of 2 sets level 1 restrictions and also
prevents users from creating or deleting individual program icons.  A value of
3 sets level 2's restrictions and prevents users from modifying the
command-line parameters of groups or icons in the File/Properties dialog box.
A value of 4 sets level 3's resrictions and prevents users from making cahnges
to any program-item information in the FIle/properties dialog box.

Peace and I'm out
Dr. TEchno
