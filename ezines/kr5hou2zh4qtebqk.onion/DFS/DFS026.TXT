                        The Return Of DFS

     The pus clears away and something steps out of the darkness.  It's in the
form of a huge... shit.. what is it???  It's not spam.. it's not vasaline,
it's not a fat lady wearing spandex named Buelah... what the hell is it??!?!?
Suddenly you relise!!!!  It's not that severed head you keep under your pillow
that you fondle at night... and it's not even those mutilated entrails that you
hang from your bathroom lights.  No.. it's something much worse!  You can hear
it coming... "Jingle jingle... jingle jingle..."  Oh my GOD!!! It's.. it's...

     Oh fuck... it's back.  You were hoping that it had died.  Well, a mixture
school, rape, sex, drugs, alcohal, work, sex, and more drugs made it almost
IMMPOSSIBLE to write or publish anything having to do with DFS.  Well, I guess
your dreams have been shattered you ugly fuck!  DFS is back to BOTHER THE FUCK
OUT OF YOU!!!!!  There's more "official" distro. sites now and all that crap!
It's still available by FTP!  Isn't it K-rAd!!!   Oh.. and no more fucking
file_id.diz stuff anymore.  It was too hard to keep up with.  So I'll leave
you to suffer knowing that DFS will be with you forever!!!!  HAHAHAHH!!!!!!!!!
