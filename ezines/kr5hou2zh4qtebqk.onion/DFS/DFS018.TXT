[Editor's Note: Well, seeing that this was sent in anonymously, I can't in
 anyway verify the authenticity of this.  So if you are the sysop of Blurred
 Vision and this didn't really happen to you, oh well.  Write something about
 it and maybe I'll publish it.  If this DID happen though, thanks, a lot of
 people will laugh.  So anyway, this may have happened, it may have not.  In
 any case, it's pretty funny.  -AD]

What were those again?

Death by means of Blacklisture.

Blacklisture?

Yes.

Could you define that for me?

The ruining of an individuals "BBS" life.

But, according to you, I don't have one.

Then you have nothing to worry about. Leave me.

If I have nothing to worry about, why don't you let me on?

Because you do not have the proper New User Password.

So fill me in.

The New User Password is "G"

No it's not.

Is that with the dashes?

no.. hist Crtl, then Alt, then Del.. (Hold them all down real tight)

On my keyboard?

Yes.

I don't have a Ctrl key...just little Apples.
***Heh heh

Uhh.. get out of my fucking face.

I am supposed to tell you I have access on the best board in the AC.

What board would that be?
