                          DFS Index #1

     Well DFS has lasted 33 issues.  So here's an index.  I'll put an index
every so often I guess.  Whenever I feel like it really.. like I care about
anyone else's ideas.  If you don't know what the issue was about, too bad, go
waste some d/l points and find out.
