                         Dementia Praecox's Sig.

         .He who speaks freely with the goats roaming freely on the
 planes of our existence, while the wildflowers sway steadily in the
 breeze, and the insects dance, and the Aunt Jamima company pours gallons
 more of the precious rescources contained on this planet down the
 throats of its latest victims, and more and more of the macaroni and
 cheese we need here is seent to support the Kurds enduring a separate
 plight, and the gnomes that live in the walls keep building and building
 on what is not there to build upon, and more and more books are written
 in tribute to that guy that is the symbol for the Quaker company, and
 Wilford rambles on and on, and Campbells soup is finally finding its way
 down the Mighty Mississippi, to where the elk will stomp around in their
 joyful bliss, so unaware of the threat posed to them by the nuns living
 in the lakes around them, and more and more pigeons are named "Elmer",
 while more and more people are named "Sparkle", and small pagan gods sit
 alone with their cults, biding their time, and the bread gets dirtier,
 and the great ogre sleeps the years away, just as he has for many
 millenium, in a small crate on the ocean floor, and more and more words
 that don't belong find their ways into dictionaries, such "Beat'ùeled",
 and "Org'ùaùfunk", and the children cry for they do not quite realize
 what has happened to the old days, when a man could beat you over the
 head with a gigantic mushroom, call you "Oblong", and then, when he
 finally did get thrown in prison, he would whine about why the dog was
 so wet, when all they had done was a little softshoe, and spiders grow
 another leg, only this one is for some reason made out of Swiss cheese,
 and becomes gangrenous and falls off every six days, and the "Eggo"
 company changes its name see "Day-glow", and starts making pancakes
 instead of waffles, and the horde of ants comes, carries off your
 grapes, eats your cottage cheese, and all you get in return is a handful
 of dung and a kiss on the cheek, and it finally becomes known that
 carpet is actually made people that have been given the death penalty in
 a court of law, and the marshmallows of your past come to life in
 frightening detail, descrbing the year of your life that you spent in
 Hong Kong, under the assumed name of "Moe" and you sold contraband
 poultry to the revolutionaires their, and the wheel of time keeps going
 on and on along the path of evolution.
