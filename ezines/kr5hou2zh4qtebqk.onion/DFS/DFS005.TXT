ds goes down for
some reason. *** The ONLY advantage of being a distro site is I put your
BBS name and number in these files. If you are the first for your AC, then
you are advertised at the end of each file. If you are the second or third,
then you are put in the master list every 25th file, or when I release
a 'current news' file. If you wish to carry the files, PLEASE DO. You can 
call yourself a distro if want, that is fine with me. I only want these 
files to be circulated.
        If you are on the net and want the newest releases, mail me at
the above address saying you wish to get new releases. I have a 'mailing
list' set up so I can mail it to anyone who wants it. If you mail me back,
it does not get circulated to everyone, only I see it.
        Also, if you are interested in getting other interesting news,
funny stories, convention info, or whatever else I get, I have a 'forward
mailing list' set up. Mail me if you would like to be on this. Recently,
I have been bouncing a lot of information on current legislation affecting
online access, articles about the Waco hearings, and other stuff.

        As usual, any comments, questions, bitches, gripes, submissions,
flames, threats, or anything else, mail me :  jericho@netcom.com

some of those little fuckheads.  I put the gun down on the seat
next to me and pulled out of the driveway.
...Jingle, Jingle...Jingle, Jingle...
     It was a couple of blocks before someone was hungry. As I
was driving past a house, the door flew open, slammed shut, and a
small shape rocketed toward me, screaming "Wait, wait!" the whole
goddamned time.  As if I was going to fucking take off and miss
this.  As it turned out, it was a little girl, about four or five
years old.  I pulled the truck to a stop and turned toward her.
...Jingle, Jingle...Jingle, Jingle...
     "And what would you like, little girl?" I asked sweetly.
     "Give me an ice cream sandwich!" she shrieked at me.  Bitch.
     "Coming right up" I responded.
     I reached down onto the seat next to me, and grasped the
handle of the gun.  I slowly picked it up, holding it just uinder
the window.  The little bitch was looking the other way.
     "Oh, little girl?"
     She turned to look at me.  In one fluid motion, I brought
the gun up to bear, aimed out the window, and pulled back on the
trigger.  For just an instant, I saw a look of astonishment on
her face, then heard the "Whirr" of a bullet passing through a
silencer.  The gun kicked, and then her little face exploded in a
puddle of blood and bits of flesh.  It was hilarious.
...Jingle, Jingle...Jingle, Jingle...
     I hopped out of the truck to get the little body.  She, or
what was left of her, was lying face down on the ground, with a
huge hole in the back of her skull.  Pieces of brain oozed out,
over the shattered bone, and dripped down what was once her face.
I picked the carcass up, went around, and back into the truck.  I
opened up the ice crem freezer in back (I left it empty today)
and threw her in.  Then I put the truck into drive and drove on
to find another customer.
...Jingle, Jingle...Jingle, Jingle...
     A few blocks over, another victim appeared.  This time it
was a boy of about seven.  He didn't seem to want any ice cream
though.  Too bad, he was getting some.
...Jingle, Jingle...Jingle, Jingle...
     I was about half a block away when he started crossing the
street.  I laughed, then slammed down on the accelerator.  He
looked up, but didn't seem to understand what was about to
happen.  That is, until the truck smashed into his face at 50
miles per hour.
     There was a sickening "CRUNCH", and he went down.  I heard a
"thud", and slammed on the brakes.  Looking back, I coudln't see
him.  Then I saw his head and arms sticking out from under a
tire.  The fucking truck waas on top of him!  I backed it off,
then I got out.  Another twisted and broken body for the freezer.
...Jingle, Jingle...Jingle,Jingle...
     When there was no room left in the freezer, I drove home.
Lots of parents might be wondering where '"junior" was.  I had
used up all of my bullets, and put several dents in the truck.
Still, I didn't care.  I had a fucking blast.  Now, what does one
do with about 20 bodies?
...Jingle, Jingle...Jingle, Jingle...
