                         Enigma Lyrics

Ok d00dz... well I said to myself when I started DFS that I
would NEVER publish lyrics.  Well I can't pass up this stuff
by Enigma.  It's too c00l.  So here's the lyrics to "The Cross
Of Changes", Enigma's second CD...

1. Second Chapter (2.16)
------------------------
We came out from the deep
To help and understand but not to kill
It takes many lives till we succeed
To clear the debts
        of many, many hundred years.

2. The Eyes Of Truth (7.13)
---------------------------
(Instrumental)

3. Return To Innocence (4.17)
-----------------------------
Love - Devotion
Feeling - Emotion

Don't be afraid to be weak
Don't be too proud to be strong
Just look into your heart my friend
That will be the return to yourself
The return to innocence.

If you want, then start to laugh
If you must, then start to cry
Be yourself don't hide
Just believe in destiny.

Don't care what people say
Just follow your own way
Don't give up and use the chance
To return to innocence.

That's not the beginning of the end
That's the return to yourself
The return to innocence.

4. I Love You ... I'll Kill You (8.51)
--------------------------------------
I see love, I can see passion
I feel danger, I feel obsession
Don't play games with the ones who love you
Cause I hear a voice who says:
I love you ... I'll kill you ...

Loneliness, I feel loneliness in my room ...

Look into the mirror of your soul
Love and hate are one in all
Sacrifice turns to revenge and believe me
You'll see the face who'll say:

I love you ... I'll kill you ...
But I'll love you forever

Lonliness, I feel loneliness in my room ...

5. Silent Warrior (6.10)
------------------------
Long ago, for many years
White men came in the name of GOD.
They took their land, the took their lives
A new age has just begun.

They lost theit GODS, they lost their smile
They cried for help for the last time.
Liberty was turning into chains
But all the white men said
That's the cross of changes.

In the name of GOD - The fight for gold
These were the changes.
Tell me - is it right - In the name of GOD
These kind of changes?

They tried to fight for liberty
Without a chance in hell, they gave up.
White men won in the name of GOD
With the cross as alibi.

There's no GOD who ever tried
TO change the world in this way.
But for the ones who abuse his name
There'll be no chance to escape
On judgement day.

In the name of GOD - The fight for gold
These were the changes.
Tell me - Is it right - In the name of GOD
These kind of changes?

Tell me why, tell me why, tell me why,
The white men said:
That's the cross of changes?
Tell me why, tell me why, tell me why,
In the name of GOD
These kind of chnages.

6. The Dream Of The Dolphin (2.47)
----------------------------------
In every colour there's the light.
In every stone sleeps a crystal.
Remember the Shaman, when he used to say:
"Man is the dream of the dolphin".

(dedicated to my beloved wife Sandra)

7. Age Of Loneliness (5.22)
   (Carly's Song)
---------------------------
Carly don't be sad
Life is crazy
Life is mad
Don't be afraid

Carly don't be sad
That's your destiny
The only chance
Take it, take it in your hands

(from the Paramount Pictures
movie "Sliver")

8. Out From The Deep (4.53)
---------------------------
We came out from the deep
To learn to love, to learn how to live
We came out from the deep
To avoid the mistakes we made.

That's why we are handy!

We came out from the deep
To help and understand, but not to kill
It takes many lives till we succeed
To clear the debts of many hundred years.

That's why we are here!

9. The CROSS Of Changes (2.23)
------------------------------
If you understand or if you don't
If you believe or if you doubt

There's a universal justice
And the eyes of truth
Are always watching you.
