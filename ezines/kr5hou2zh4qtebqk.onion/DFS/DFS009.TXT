BackGround:  Over all my years on this planet.. There are some things that
 i could NEVER come to understand.. Some of these things are: infommercials..
 John Denver.. Aunt Jemima <SP?>.. and CREAM OF WHEAT!.. Recent experiments
 have prompted me to write about my findings.. i was also inspired by Access
 Denied's (NOT THE GROUP) reasoning of Vaseline, Jello, and Spam..

 ..i hate you, Cream of Wheat
 ..you smell.. like rotting feet
 ..White, pasty.. like bird poo
 ..You murderous phlegm.. FUCK YOU.

 ..i hate you, Cream of Wheat
 ..derived from decaying forms of meat
 ..indeed.. a murderous fiend
 ..relative.. of Soylent Green.

 ..i hate you, Cream of Wheat
 ..what would prompt a person to eat
 ..your vile stench.. your horrid taste
 ..much like that.. of Kindergarten paste.

 ..i hate you, Cream of Wheat
 ..you killed my friend.. name was Pete
 ..head swelled.. seizures took control
 ..innocent SHiT.. lurking in your bowl.


Notes for lamerz:  No one actually says "poo" anymore.. but it rhymed..
 also.. Soylent Green was a movie in which the government gave people food..
 composed of parts of human carcass..

Later..
