                            - Green Demon Asshole -
                       by some anonymous internet poster

Her fingers slid into his rectum like they had so many times before.
Eventually, her entire hand was inside, and she was feeling around for
the baggie full of heroin.  He grunted.

"Hurry up," he said, "I'm getting a hardon."

"It's stuck!" she said, and pulled on the baggie.

"Careful! You break that baggie, I'm dead!"

"I got it, it's just not coming out."

"Why the hell not?"

"Have you been eating glue or something?"

"Quit joking and yank it out, but slowly."

She twisted her fingers around, and pulled.  It felt like something was
pulling it back inside.  Eventually, carefully, slowly, she brought it
to the rectum, and was gently pulling it out.  Meanwhile, he'd started
to jerk off, getting off on the slow tug of the baggie in his bowels.

"Do you have to do that?" she muttered.

He only moaned in response.

When she pulled the baggie out, a tiny green figure with tiny green arms
stuck its head out, snarled, and started pulling the baggie back in.
She screamed, and fell back on the dirty mattress.  The creature hissed,
clutched the baggie in tiny claws, and disapeared with the baggie, back
into his bowels.

He came all over the mattress as she screamed again.

"Wh-what?" he half moaned.

"There's a tiny green demon in your asshole!" she yelled.

He turned around and looked at her.

"What the fuck are you talking about?  Where's the baggie?"

"A tiny green demon pulled it back into your asshole," she whimpered.

He snorted.  "Bullshit.  Where's the baggie?  Don't pull this crap on me
now, Fay."

Fay shook her head, tears running down her pale face.  "I'm telling you,
I don't have the baggie...  A tiny green creature...  It..."

"Fay, you fucking bitch, you stupid fucking cunt..."  He swallowed his
anger.  "Ok.  What are you on?"

"I'm not on anything!" she yelled.  "Jeremy, I swear it, I'm as needy as
you."

"Maybe needier and you've stashed the baggie?" Jeremy said, his eyes
turning to slits.

"I know it's insane," Fay cried.  "Ok?  I know it!  But there was a
green demon in your ass!  I saw it!  It hissed at me, grabbed the
baggie, and pulled it back in!  I saw it, it happened...  Or maybe I'm
just fucking losing my mind..."

She started to cry.  Jeremy looked at her without sympathy.  Fay always
manipulated with tears.  He'd gotten used to it.

"Stop fucking crying," he whispered menacingly.  "You know I don't fall
for that fucking shit, so shut off the fucking waterworks."

"It was green!" Fay yelled.  "It looked like a little gargoyle!"

"So I got a green monster up my ass that wants our heroin?" he said. He
shifted on the bed.  His sperm was sticking to his leg.  He wiped it off
with disgust and flicked it off his fingers on to the dirty wood floor.

"Look, I'll get a mirror and show you!" she said.  "You hold the mirror,
and I'll try and pull the baggie out, and you'll see I'm not crazy, or
that I am!"

"Yeah," Jeremy snorted.  "Right."

"Humour me, OK?" Fay half-screamed in hysteria.

"OK, OK, fuck," Jeremy growled.  He got back on all fours.

Fay fumbled through her purse, looking for her make-up mirror.  For a
sickening moment, she couldn't find it, but then there it was, way at
the bottom, of course.

"Here," she said, and pushed it into his hand.
Jeremy adjusted it so he could see his own asshole.

"OK," he said.  "But don't move around a lot, or I'll miss it."

"OK," Fay whispered.  Her hand had gotten dry, so she rubbed more KY all
over it, then slowly stuck her hand back in.  Jeremy sighed in pleasure.
He couldn't help it.  He loved having his ass fucked.

Fay nervously pushed in.  She found the baggie again with her
fingertips.  This time, she was sure she felt tiny green claws pulling
back on the baggie as she pulled it towards the opening.  Jeremy's hand
shook as he held the mirror with one hand, and balanced his body with
the other.

"Hold the mirror steady," Fay whined.

"OK, OK," Jeremy sighed.

She slowly pulled the baggie out.  The green demon poked its head out
and hissed.  Fay saw it better this time.  Its face was like a bat's,
with a pug nose and red eyes.  Jeremy screamed "Holy fuck!" then dropped
the mirror and jumped to his feet.  He kicked Fay as he leaped up, but
she managed to see the demon pull the baggie back inside.

"Holy fuck!" Jeremy screamed.  He was shaking all over.  He looked about
the room.  He put his hand on his naked stomach.  He looked at Fay.  He
went to touch his asshole, then stopped himself.

"There's a..." Jeremy started.  His face suddenly filled with rage. He
ran over to a milk crate lying across the room that he and Fay used as a
table.

"Jeremy, don't do anything!  We've got to think about this!  We have
to..."

"Fuck that!" Jeremy screamed.  "I know what to do about this little
fucker!"  Jeremy grabbed his handgun off the milk crate, bent over, and
shoved it up his asshole.

"Jeremy!  Don't be insane!  It will..."

BANG.

Jeremy fell on to the floor, blood spraying out of his asshole,
screaming in agony.  There was a second, shriller scream coming from his
rectum.  Jeremy lay on the floor writhing, trying to get control of the
pain.

"Get the baggie!" Jeremy yelled, grinding his teeth.

Fay stood stock still in shock.  The recoil had thrown the gun across
the room.  She looked at it lying in the corner, smoke coming from its
barrel.

"Fay!" Jeremy yelled.  "FAY!  Snap out of it and get the fucking
baggie."

Fay looked at the torn, bleeding asshole and threw up all over the
mattress.  She wiped the puke off her face.

"Get the fucking baggie, Fay," Jeremy moaned.  His face was all white.
His entire body was shaking.

"You... You don't look so good, Jeremy," Fay whispered.

"Of course I don't.... I..."  Jeremy collapsed.  His eyes rolled up. His
body shuddered, then was still.

Fay leapt to her feet.  "Jeremy?" she squealed.  He didn't answer. She
slowly walked towards the body.  Was the thing inside him really dead?
She brought a shaking hand to Jeremy's throat.  No pulse.  She looked at
his bleeding asshole, and felt bile rise.  She closed her eyes, and
slowly pushed her hand inside the torn hole.  She felt around with her
fingers until somewhere deep inside, somewhere in his guts, she found
the baggie.  It felt like it was unbroken.  She slowly drew it out.
Something, the demon, was still holding on to it.  She could feel
something dragging along.  But the demon wasn't moving.

She pulled the baggie out, and the demon came out with it.  One of its
tiny arms was gone.  It was breathing quickly.  It couldn't keep its
grasp on the bag, and it fell to the floor.  It hissed once, feebly,
then closed its eyes.  It died with a slight spasm.

Fay got out her shooting up equipment out of her purse.  She sat herself
on the floor across the room from Jeremy's corpse and the deead gargoyle
thing.  She hunted for a vein.  She slid the needle in.

"Weird shit," she said as she pushed the plunger home.
