                           - Another Poetry Interlude -
                                   by Caty Eye

Alot of you guys find my poetry depressing, sad, whatever, well it is..
Not much is happy, though I will try to scratch up a couple of the happy
ones too, I know I have a couple laying around here somewhere.. But most
of it is, indeed, depressing.. because, well, because that's just me, and
my style I guess.. who knows.. My poetry is my way of expressing my
feelings of hurt/anger/saddness/depression whatever you would like to call
it.. I easily express my happy feelings, but it is the hurt that always
seems to have trouble spewing out.. If I wasn't so nice and respectful to
others I probably wouldn't have this problem, really.. I always keep
things bottled up inside of me though, I'll take anything you can dish out
to me, but more than likely, I won't dish anything back out to you, I'll
just bottle it up and store it away.. Sucks, eh? Yeah, I know, tell me
about it, I live it.. I'm getting a little better with that though, not a
whole heck of a lot, but a little, it's the way I was raised I guess, I
was never allowed to raise my voice, or protest anything without being
severely punished for it, so I kept quiet all of the time!

  Enough of my babble.. here are some poems, these poems have been
accumulated over the years, dealing with very hard and troubling times for
me, this has been my way to make myself feel better.. I think my later
poems are better, because as I've aged, I've matured, and found my own
styles, some better than others.. all of my poems have extreme meaning and
strong feelings behind them, who knows, maybe someone will actually stop
and thinking about something soon following........ Since there are fewer,
we'll do happy poems first.

 My sun is always shining, never does it rain
 I have you to thank for that, for playing my game
 Not once would you think about, giving up on me
 And how much you love me, I can easily see
 
 Friendship brought us together, love might take us apart
 The thing that I fear most, if that I will break your heart
 I may not show it often, but I love you so much
 And my heart beats differently, at your very touch
 
 Should my sunshine fade, or the raindrops fall
 Always remember, I will come at your call
 You fullfill all of my dreams of hope, love and life
 And if we could make it that far, I'd happily be your wife

          "My Sunshine" 
----------------------------





 A rose is a gentle thing,
  just like my heart,
 Dare not to break it,
  it would tear me apart.
 I know what we have,
  is only a small start
 But my feelings inside,
  have just hit me like a dart.

 My love is a great thing,
  gentle and free,
 You've got to earn your rights,
  to become a part of me.
 But once you've done that,
  can't you see,
 It would be very painful,
  if you set it all free.

 So, what do you think,
  is it worth a shot,
 You have to let me know, 
  if this means a lot.
 And I know what you're thinking,
  what a lot of bull,
 But if that's how you feel,
  then you're the fool.

 And with all of this,
  I give you my symbol,
 A white dove for you,
  a gift from me,
 My symboly of love,
  now do you see?

     "A Start"
------------------------

 Always landing on all fours
  no matter how hard they fall
   no matter how long they drop
    always poised and graceful
  Always purring, and lurking about
   no matter what mood they're in
    no matter who is around
     always poised and somewhat playful
  Always there when someone needs them
   no matter where they are or have been
    no matter where they're going or have gone
     always poised and pretty joyful

            "Cats"
----------------------------


 Someone to understand
  is all I need
 Someone to listen to care
  not a big greed

 I thought I had this person,
  what I thought was wrong
 True friends are forever
  they're what keep hearts strong

 So when you think you've got a catch
  you'd better think twice
 People can be very tricky
  so make sure they're really nice

 I never liked to get hurt
  but who ever really does
 No one care for any extra pain
  what life brings is enough

 Before you go and gloat
  be sure you're really safe
 You don't want to sink your own boat
  so check for more than just a pretty face

        "Inside Out" 
---------------------------

  "And now, for something a little different...."

---------------------------
 Another day gone at last
 Two good friends, away they passed
 Another broken heart to mend
 Crying out for me, and only me, Jen
 Another sticky situation on this day
 What can I do, what can I say?
 His cries are serious, his cries are silent
 But how can I stop his aweful violence
 What does he want, what does he need?
 All he longs for is to stop his heart bleed
 All he needs is an open ear
 To let out his feelings on death, his biggest fear
 But memories will help him along
 They'll help take care of all that's wrong
 But nothing at all can take away his pain
 He's just lost a sister, to this there's nothing to gain
 Nothing can take away his terrible pain, for sure
 Because heartbreak, definatly, has no cure

        "Heartbreak" 
-----------------------------

 Everynight she sits there alone,
 She can think of nothing but herself and you
 She sits there alone at heaven's door
 Knocking and knocking, finally to enter
 Once inside, she looks around
 The rooms are so beautiful
 Full of excitment and joy
 But she finds herself alone
 Shouting and screaming, no one answers
 No one hears a lonely girls cries of pain
 She quiets, calms, searching for a clue
 Into a bright she wandered; a key
 Trying to put together a puzzle,
 A broken puzzle, the center piece missing
 After looking at the unfinished puzzle for hours
 She came to realize the piece was irreplaceable
 The bright room suddenly darkened
 Crumbled, torn apart, the puzzle is places back in it's box
 Useless, uncared for, never thought of again
 This puzzle brought forth only heartache 
 The search incomplete, like everything else
 The lonely girls walks away, alone as entered
 I walked through Heavens dorrs worse than before
 Looking back, with a tear in my eye
 I cried a good-bye to the lonely house of pain

   August 31, 1992  
   "House of Pain" 
-----------------------


 A cold and lonely night
 No one is around
 A lonely girl sits all alone
 Arms folded for warmth and security
 Head down to hide her tears
 At first glance up she searches
 Searching for something not in her reach
 She quickly gives up hope
 Sitting there alone; it starts to rain
 The girl lets out a sudden scream
 Picking her head up once again
 Again, realizing she is alone
 She cries out louder and louder
 Hoping someone could hear her
 As I sat there, alone in the rain
 Crying to myself, all I craved
 Was the touch of another
 Someone's voice to tell me all would be okay
 Someone to hold me, and hide the rain
 My third glance up was total blackness
 A sudden waken from my sleep
 Sweating coldly, shaking in fright
 I looked around, only to find myself
 Alone and scared

     "Alone and Scared" 

That's it for now.. I think that may be too many as it is.. if you guys 
want more, I'll do more, if not, I won't, but it's up to you, you have 
to read it.. It's no problem to type out.. I have many, many more.. 
typing this stirred up many feelings and thoughts, I hope it stirred up
something in someone else besides just me!

  All of the above poems are original pieces of work by me, and only me!
