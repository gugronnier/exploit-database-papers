                        - The Abduction of a Social Geek -
                                   by Locutus

        Bah, I've never much liked American society. It's so full of
double-  standards it isn't even funny. Many people don't even open
their eyes and  bother to question the rules of society, and I was one
of them.

        For a long time, I used to believe everything about America and
its  people was just super-fine, and great, and grand. Used to believe
that Bush was doing the right thing even. Never even saw what I now see,
which is the absolute brainwashing of society. It starts at birth, and
your parents take part in it, unknowingly, as it is instilled deep in
their subconsious as  well. If you are a guy, when you grow up you are
automatically expected to  be rich, doing great, and have 50 women at
your call. (the last bit isn't  that bad, really) When this doesn't
happen, the person is automatically  branded a loser. Why? Because
that's society. And for women, they're expected to be perfect angels,
never yielding. Of course, this is widely debated now, and I think I
wont get involved in that issue, at least in this file. And  also, when
I was brought up, I believed in Catholic faiths. I never even
questioned the Bible, or my religion, or anything. Simply went along,
trying my best to fit in, which, of course, is impossible for some. This
all came to an abrupt end in 1992.

        At the beginning of 1992, a friend of mine known to some as
Spartacus got a 2400 baud modem for his IBM compatible computer. I
thought that was  neat-o, and I was introduced to modeming. I've had a
Commodore 64, and never had a modem, so I was in for a complete suprise.
Both Spart and I were  astounded at all the possibilites (or at least I
was, who knows what he was thinking at the time). At first, he used it
mainly for file purposes. Then he found doors, and he proclaimed them
fun. I finally logged on as me on a few bbs's with my real name at bbs's
like Ground Zero, a door gamer's heaven. These soon grew tiresome for
Spart, but I still made the trek to his house to finish up Blue Devil in
Global War. But it was not until I got my own  computer and modem when
the fun began.

        April 21, 1992: Got my computer, and a spiffy one at that. Got a
lot of software from Spart, and immediately called up Ground Zero to get
my  gaming in. I had fun then, staying up nights just to get a game of
SRE in. Until the Night Light incident, which I mark as a turning point
for me in  BBSing. 

        On Night Light (one great BBS, I might add), the sysop added a
function to the bbs called a gold system. This would take gold away from
people when they went in doors. Now until then, I never heard of Tal
Meta or hegz, or anyone really. Spart told me to start newscanning
message bases,  as I wasn't very popular. So I did, and I started
posting. Then John Doe, now a reformed door gamer, made idiotic posts to
keep getting gold. Over this, Tal and I would proceed to argue about him
and about this gold system, which I didn't like. But this argument made
me get more involved in message bases..

        Then I heard from TnL that Cyber/Chat! was going up, a (then) 8
line system where you could chat with other users. Since then, I have
been on constantly, talking to Tal, Hegz, Midnite, Ffejtable, and a host
of others express their opinions, which at first seemed rather shocking
to my  mainstream mind. As I actually thought about what they were
saying, it made a lot more sense than what I had previously believed.
From their ideas, I made my own views, which were much different to my
previous ones. Heh, some would probably say they corrupted my mind, but
I think they opened it up, now I can't stand talking to previous
"friends" who are just completely  enraptured and trapped in society.
The new society of people I met through C/C! and various places just
made so much more plain sense! I can't tell you that these ideas are any
more correct than the mainstream ones, as that is each individual's
opinion, but they do seem more logical. Try calling Cyber Chat and
Phoenix Modernz Systems, and open your mind.
