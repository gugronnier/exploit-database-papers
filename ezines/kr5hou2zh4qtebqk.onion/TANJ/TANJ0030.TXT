                              - TANJ Index #01 -
                                 by Tal Meta

Yes, it was eventual. There had to come a time when I sat back, and said to
myself, TANJ needs an index. So now you're getting one. Its file #30, so at
least by the time #60 rolls around, now you'll know to expect another
index. 

These files have been, by and large, a success. Some people love them, some
people hate them, but my front end mailer still gets at least one request a
week for one of these files, or the whole set. I was pretty impressed when
a system that SAID it was in Tailand called and FREQ'd the batch. Who
knows.

The file that follows deliniates the TANJ that are. More are going to
follow. At the end of this file, I will give you all a few teasers about
the TANJni I know are coming. (Jesu, its nice to have a STAFF of writers!
Yay!)

Filename        : TANJ.000
Description     : Afterthoughts - Writers Guidelines For Tanj
Written by      : Tal Meta
File Size       : 4131 bytes
Date of Release : 03/14/92

I called it afterthoughts because thats exactly what it was. An
afterthought. It was actually the 5th or 6th file released (TANJ.005 was
released the same day.)

Filename        : TANJ.001
Description     : How To Host A Bust
Written by      : Tal Meta
File Size       : 7684 bytes
Date of Release : 12/28/91

I originally wrote the first TANJ file more to NOT have to retell my tale
of Search and Seizure for the nine millionth time than to do anything else.
But, upon having written it, I decided that the whole story might make for
a good series of files.

Filename        : TANJ.002
Description     : Words To Live By
Written by      : Tal Meta
File Size       : 11397 bytes
Date of Release : 12/30/91

For years, I'd been collecting quotes and various bits of doggerel. I
decided to share the whole mess with the world.

Filename        : TANJ.003
Description     : The Last Mile
Written by      : Tal Meta
File Size       : 9226 bytes
Date of Release : 01/17/92

By the time this file was written, I'd finally managed to irritate the
local gendarmes enough for them to actually arrest me.

Filename        : TANJ.004
Description     : This Ain't No Sanfile / I Hate Banks
Written by      : Tal Meta (82)
File Size       : 11157 bytes
Date of Release : 02/21/92

This file was mostly inspired by two things: the fact that my previous
textfile group seemed intent on reprinting every issue of TANJ under its
own banner, and my rage at a local banking conglomerate for its rather poor
public relations strategy.

Filename        : TANJ.005
Description     : A Night In The Life
Written by      : Tal Meta
File Size       : 6519 bytes
Date of Release : 03/14/92

This was the first "Fictional" TANJ. Its set in a suitably sanitized
version of my home town, and has alot of inside jokes that are sure to be
lost on 99.9% of the people who read it. Oh well.

Filename        : TANJ.006
Description     : On The Origins Of Derf
Written by      : Tal Meta
File Size       : 8759 bytes
Date of Release : 07/06/92

This file has alot in common with TANJ.001, in that it was written so that
I would not have to endlessly repeat the story of Derf over and over. Derf
is a popular local ledgend, and the story continues to this day.

Filename        : TANJ.007
Description     : At The End Of My Rope
Written by      : Tal Meta
File Size       : 9418 bytes
Date of Release : 07/22/92

This file continues my "Bust" story, and details my entrance into the
Criminal Justice System. Oh, joy.

Filename        : TANJ.008
Description     : I Couldn't Think Of A Name. So There.
Written by      : by Hairy Leech
File Size       : 13363 bytes
Date of Release : 08/07/92

This is the first TANJ not written by me. On reflection, this one SHOULD
have been titled "Going Crazy in the Suburbs", but the phrase hadn't yet
been coined, so to speak. Too late now, of course.

Filename        : TANJ.009
Description     : Blood Lust 01: The Awakening
Written by      : Anonymous Bosch
File Size       : 9220 bytes
Date of Release : 08/09/92

This is arguably the most successful TANJ file to date. What it lacks in
story, characterization, and plot, it makes up in unmitigated gore. I'm
pretty happy with it, to be honest. It sparked a new interest in textfiles
in alot of people I can name.

Filename        : TANJ.010
Description     : Donkeys Can't Sleep In Bathtubs
Written by      : by Ffejtable?
File Size       : 16565 bytes
Date of Release : 08/15/92

By this point, I was starting to feel like an editor. I had three writers,
and a slew of other people who were promising me files "soon". August was a
busy month.

Filename        : TANJ.011
Description     : Blood Lust 02: The Consumation
Written by      : Anonymous Bosch
File Size       : 19802 bytes
Date of Release : 08/16/92

The second Blood Lust file. Not quite as popular as the first with some, it
is the midpoint of a promised trilogy. Its been awhile, though, since I
heard from the author.

Filename        : TANJ.012
Description     : The Family Pool
Written by      : Urethris
File Size       : 10173 bytes
Date of Release : 08/21/92

For awhile, it was beginning to look like TANJ had become a blood & gore
mag. While I still think this file was good, I'm glad we did manage to turn
away from the death angles for awhile.

Filename        : TANJ.013
Description     : Poems & Memories
Written by      : Donna Ivins-Cobain
File Size       : 8325 bytes
Date of Release : 08/23/92

This file was written by an ex-girlfriend of mine. I wonder if anyone has
told her about it yet? I COULD call her, but.... nah.

Filename        : TANJ.014
Description     : Going Crazy In The Suburbs: 01
Written by      : Hairy Leech
File Size       : 32881 bytes
Date of Release : 08/24/92

This was the file that coined the phrase "Going crazy in the Suburbs", and
I was beginning to detect a wee bit of continuity in Hairy's work. Not that
I minded... his files go together well, and are a fascinating view inside
the mind of Amerikka's youth.

Filename        : TANJ.015
Description     : Terrible Lies
Written by      : Tal Meta
File Size       : 7988 bytes
Date of Release : 09/01/92

This file was sorta inspired by TANJ.006. When the Immortal Derf found out
that I'd written a file about him, he felt the need to obfuscate about it.
So I chose to return the favor.

Filename        : TANJ.016
Description     : The Abduction Of A Social Geek
Written by      : Locutus of Borg
File Size       : 6328 bytes
Date of Release : 09/13/92

This was a file I asked for. I'd wanted it to be a compilation, but nobody
else had the time to get theirs done. This was the first file I ever sent
back for a rewrite. Hadda happen sooner or later.

Filename        : TANJ.017
Description     : A Parody Of Star Trek:The Next Generation
Written by      : Mr. Wizzard
File Size       : 19940 bytes
Date of Release : 09/13/92

This file is still one of my favorites. But then again, I like parodies.
Shoot me.

Filename        : TANJ.018
Description     : The 69 Laws Of Bbsing
Written by      : Spartacus
File Size       : 7528 bytes
Date of Release : 09/17/92

This was orignially only 59 laws, but everyone felt that a more
"interesting" number of laws ought to exist. So we (read I) added some.

Filename        : TANJ.019
Description     : Man Of Steel / Woman Of Kleenex
Written by      : by Larry Niven (typed and editted by Spartacus)
File Size       : 15706 bytes
Date of Release : 09/17/92

Okay. I once said I didn't want anyone else's work appearing as a TANJ. I
made an exception in the case of this file. I used to laugh myself silly
over this file in my teens, when I saw it published. And Spart just
happened to have it already typed up. I just couldn't resist.

Filename        : TANJ.020
Description     : God Save The Children / Home Crucifiction Guide
Written by      : by Spartacus & Locutus of Borg
File Size       : 9724 bytes
Date of Release : 09/28/92

This file was the first actual "compilation". God Save the Children was a
file I originally intended to write, but could never get past the first few
sentences of. So, I tossed it out on the GODNet TANJ Writer's Echo and
asked someone else to run with the idea. Spartacus took it, and in my
opinion, did a better job with it than I would have. I still think it
should have had rats in the dumpster, but thats just me. The Guide resulted
from a common "amusement" offered on a local chat system.

Filename        : TANJ.021
Description     : Above And Beyond
Written by      : Spartacus
File Size       : 14411 bytes
Date of Release : 10/02/92

A serious subject, given an interesting spin.

Filename        : TANJ.022
Description     : Going Crazy In The Suburbs: 02 : Relationships
Written by      : Hairy Leech
File Size       : 9494 bytes
Date of Release : 10/05/92

I told Hairy once that his life would change once he got involved with
someone. I told him his writing style was likely to change as well. This
was his way of saying "Sorry, but I'm still waiting to see a change..."

Filename        : TANJ.023
Description     : A Mind's Eye View Of Paradise
Written by      : Spartacus
File Size       : 6607 bytes
Date of Release : 10/05/92

Life in a layered Universe. Virtual Reality with a twist.

Filename        : TANJ.024
Description     : The Night That Changed My Life
Written by      : Locutus of Borg
File Size       : 8054 bytes
Date of Release : 10/07/92

It has Elvis. It has Jesus. It has a travelling salesman. It has
a car chase. What more could you ask for?

Filename        : TANJ.025
Description     : Another Poetry Interlude
Written by      : Cat Eye
File Size       : 9595 bytes
Date of Release : 10/10/92

I believe in variety. So, from time to time, I can and will toss out things
that break the mold. This is one of those files...

Filename        : TANJ.026
Description     : 101 Ways To Wash A Brain
Written by      : Mystic Journeyer
File Size       : 9331 bytes
Date of Release : 10/12/92

A fascinating look inside one of the world's largest cults, and its popular
form of brainwashing Amerikka's youth.

Filename        : TANJ.027
Description     : Going Crazy In The Suburbs: 03 : Broken
Written by      : Hairy Leech
File Size       : 12018 bytes
Date of Release : 10/14/92

Hairy is still telling me nothing has changed. In a sad, twisted sort of
way, I'm glad. His writing style is unique, and I'd hate to lose it.

Filename        : TANJ.028
Description     : Life Is Pain
Written by      : Tal Meta
File Size       : 8863 bytes
Date of Release : 10/14/92

The answer to the question; "Does Tal still write for this thing or what?"
is yes. My view of the world is a bit more jaded than my younger crowd of
writers, but then again, I've seen a whole lot more real estate than most
of them. Age hath rank priveleges, or something like that.

Filename        : TANJ.029
Description     : An Off-Road Brain
Written by      : Spartacus
File Size       : 12,208 bytes
Date of Release : 10/17/92

Intense. A world view situated somewhere between mine & Hairy's. But shared
by a good portion of the loyal readership, I should suspect.

Filename        : TANJ.030
Description     : TANJ Index #1
Written by      : Tal Meta
File Size       : 14,223 bytes
Date of Release : 10/17/92

You're reading it. If you need me to tell you what its about, please go
open a few arteries now, before you breed more of your kind. Sheesh.

---------------------------------------------------

Okay. Whats coming up for TANJ in the future? Well, for one thing, the
final (?) Blood Lust file. Malachi has a sister, I am told... Also, a
sequel to God Save the Children. The forces of Karma aren't done with
Martin Chandler. Also, coming "soon" the final (or next to final) chapter
of Tal Meta vs. U.S. Sprint. Alot has happened with my case, but I'd really
like to get it all ended before I write another file on it. Or maybe not.
I've got a horror story kicking around too... one of these days I'll be in
a demented enough mood to put it into text. Plus, MAYBE another Larry Niven
story. Depends on if anyone wants to type it up. I'm gonna go hunt for an
old "questionare" I once was aked to answer... given the distance of a few
years, its now hillarious as hell. Look for it soon!
