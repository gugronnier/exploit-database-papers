                      - You Ain't My Mother, Uncle Sam! -
                                  by Ulycees

                For my own personal safety? Why thank you for caring, but I
dont think that I need you looking out for me. Who is "You"? You ask. "You"
are those law making people. The people that are higher in all knowledge
than the rest of "Us". They are the people that are setting the moral
standards in this great, twisted country of ours. Don't get me wrong, I
love this country, I wouldn't want to live anywhere else. Besides, I think
it's kind of entertaining to see the next flash of brilliance that the
government will spew forth. Now, my topic...

                There are certain law making bodies out there that think
they have to take care of us. These are the people that pass laws for "Our
Own Personal Safety". Ok, I'll agree, it's kind of nice of them to be
thinking about me, but lets face it, I HATE to be told what to do. 

                Lets start with the subject that made me think of this text
file, the seatbelt law. Here's a good one. Me, I always where my seatbelt.
If I'm going to the store, or if I'm going on a long trip, the seatbelt is
always on. To me, they make me feel a little bit safer. Knowing that if I
do get into an accident, I might actually survive. But, why should I be
forced to where one? Other automotive laws I can understand. Speeding for
example. Speeding might put your life in danger, but it also puts the
people around  you in danger. Who is to say that you wont loose control and
slide into  someone elses car. But a seatbelt? What could happen? You get
into a head on collision, fly out your windshield and decapitate the person
in the car  infront of you? I doubt that... The only person that could get
harmed from not wearing a seat belt is myself. Therefore, I don't think I
should be forced to wear one. It should be your own choice, not some person
with a "Better Standard of Living" than the rest of us. But, unfortunatly,
thats not the way it works. The state believes that they have to tell us to
wear one because it will make our lives so much safer.

                After pondering that on the way to the Post Office (I was
wearing my seat belt on the ride there of course), I started to think about
other things. Real abstract things. "Hey, what was I gonna watch tonite?"..
"Oh yeah... Something about some guy video taping going over the falls in a
barrel on I-Witness Videos".. Then I thought to myself, "Hey wait.. Isn't
that illegal?" Whoa, there they go again. If for some assinine reason, you
felt like going over Niagra Falls in a barrel, you couldn't! Not legally
anyways. You better make sure you do it descretly and not attract alot of
attention beforehand. Why can't we do it? I guess that the law makers feel
that you would hurt yourself... Or die even. But whats it there buisness?
Maybe by the time I am 80, I will say "Wow, Ive done alot in my life. I
think I'll top it off by going over the falls". Whoa stop! Thats a no no!
But that question keeps nagging me! WHY? Why can't I do it? The only thing
that I can figure out is, they don't want to waste the time to fish me out.
Fine! Then don't! I didn't want your permission in the first place! Maybe
they think that we are polluting? Well, ok, I guess they got me on that
one. Pfft!!!

                Then from that, I was thinking about death. And that
"Right of Life/Death" thing came up in my mind. Do you know, that if you
want to die, most people won't let you? Unless, of course, you have a real
understanding friend that will help you die, then on the other hand, he may
just be a real asshole. But, look at it this way. If you try to kill
yourself, and lets say... You mess it up. Even though you wanted to die,
people are still going to try to save you. Even if doctors come to the
scene and see a note that says "I hate life, Im killing myself.. Please let
me  die in peace".. The doctors will not say "Well, he wants to die.. Pack
it up ... Call the Meat Wagon.." They are going to do their best to save
you. Then, you get into the hospital. You are on life support. The only
thing that you can do is utter a few syllables. But you can say one
sentance real well: "Take me off life support. I don't want to live". Guess
what they are going to say "Oh don't be silly.. ". Or in some cases, if
your a real vegetable,  they may even ask your family. Well, I have a real
close family, but if  I wanted to die, I would atleast expect them to grant
that wish for me. Even the Church has something to say about it! "What? He
killed himself? Christian he is not! You will not be buried in OUR grave
yard.." Hypocrits.. Jesus was the man... He could have gotten himself off
the cross right? Guess he wanted to die... But thats another story...

                My point is, why should some selected group with set
standards be able to dictate to the rest of us, what we should do. The
governement really does think that the country is filled with a bunch of
idiots that can not help themselves. They believe that if they don't tell
us what to do, we will actually hurt ourselves. 

                "No Swimming.. There are squals from the off shore huricane
that are making a severe undertoe.. You could get pulled out to sea"
                "Thats Ok.. I'll take my chances"
                "No you won't, it's the law"
                "Ahh"
