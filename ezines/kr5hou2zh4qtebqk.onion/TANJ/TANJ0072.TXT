                          BUMPER STICKER FAVORITES

                   Don't look now - your humor's showing
                  By Steven Rosen, Denver Post Arts Writer

Talk about a driving obsession!

In the June 18 Pulse column in WEEKEND!, we invited you to tell us your
favorite or most interesting bumper stickers. (Good luck Jean Thompson of
Denver trying to sell "God Created a Beautiful World - Don't Make It Ugly.)

With so many responses, trends emerged. The three I spotted were these:

People like bumper stickers that make fun of the cosmic- consciousness nature
of New Age philosophy. A good dozen callers said their favorite sticker
was "Visualize Whirled Peas," which is a parody of those "Visualize World
Peace" stickers you see in hippie outposts where people only drive cars when
not engaged in astral projection.

Others liked a sticker that says "Visualize...Using Your Turn Signal,"
which serves the same general purpose.

* There are drivers out there who disagree with gay rights. [Remember,
 this IS from Colorado!] A half-dozen callers enjoyed "God Created Adam
and Eve, not Adam and Steve."

 * Republicans hate President Bill Clinton and Democrats hate
Republicans. Among the numerous favorite bumper stickers that underscore
that point:

                            Impeach the Clintons

                 Friends don't Let Friends Vote Republican

                  Bill Clinton Doesn't Inhale - He Sucks.

                 Vote Republican - You A-- Holes Deserve It

                   First Hillary, then Gennifer, Now Us.

                 Vote Republican - Its Easier Than Thinking

                [Plus my favorite - "Picard and Riker '92"]

* Here are some others that we have room, or the good taste, to print:

                      Eat Well, Stay Fit, Die Anyway.

                   No Matter Where You Go, There You Are.

                  My Child Can Beat Up Your Honor Student.

        Don't Laugh - Your Daughter Might Be In Here. (On Old Truck)

                      Cats Flattened While You Watch.

           I May Be Fat but You're Ugly - and I Can Lose Weight.

                Kissing a Smoker is like Licking an Ashtray

                "It will be a great day when our schools get
                 all the money they need and the air force
                 has to hold a bake sale to buy a bomber."

                 Not All Men are Fools. Some are Bachelors.
