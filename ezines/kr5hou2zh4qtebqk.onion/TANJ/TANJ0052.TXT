                            - A GREAT INJUSTICE -
                              by  Bazil Ratbone

	Okay here's my story.... It was mischief night just like any other
mischief night, but this year I thought to myself..hmmm, "I'm not gonna
just sit around this night like every year, I'm gonna do something good."
(I thought yea I'd be a big guy and do something big)  So I made a call to
a kid across the street from me who told me that I could go with him and
some kid who drove a brand new black Firebird. He told me they had sixteen
dozen eggs and I didn't have to pay for them. When I heard this I told him
I'd be over in a couple of minutes.

	I grabbed my own two dozen eggs and headed off to his house. When I
 got there I saw him stick a b.b. gun down his pants (he had a CO2
operating  one) he said, "Go run home and get yours."  I thought to
myself..hmmm, "Now this will be great." (I should've realized how stupid I
was at the time.) I ran across the street, went in my house and searched
through my b.b. guns, I found my hand gun (not a CO2 but quite powerfull)
and stuck it in my big heavy jacket. As I ran out the door my mother
yelled, "Stop!"  She told me  she wanted to now where I was going I told
her to my friends house, she let me reluctantly.

	When I got to his house our ride was already there, we packed
everything up and headed out for what would've seemed to be a great night.
At first we rode around looking for little kids in my neighborhood. After a
 while we got bored and went to the kids house who was driving. In this
story I'll refer to him as Chuck and the kid who lives across the street
from me as Tom. We searched his neighborhood quickly for kids then headed
into Toms River to steal some car stereo which they had heard of. When we
got there the  car that supposedly had a killer "system" wasn't there so we
started back to Brick. We stopped and ate at Kentucky Fried Chicken (no
plug intended that was the first place we saw). We ate then headed back
home again.

	On the way we saw four girls walking, we shut off the lights and
drove up to them. As we flew by them we must've hit them with about two
eggs each. We went back for another pass but this time they were ready and
threw a great shot. Lucky for us it hit the t-top so it came off easily
(this car  was beutiful). On the last pass I noticed that I knew the girls
and were good friends with each of them. We went back to Chuck's house so
we could  figure out what we were gonna do. So far I thought it was a lame
night,  it was rainy and no one was outside. At Chuck's we shot a couple
eggs out of my three-man slingshot. We bagged a couple of houses but soon
got bored. We left the house in plain to do something "big."  We turned a
corner and saw a car sitting there with a for sale sign on it. 

	We pulled out our b.b. guns and as we drove by we fired away (I had
an air pump gun so I only got one powerful shot off, but Tom's gun let out
eight bullets in three seconds) as we bombarded the car a rush was sent
through me. I didn't know if the rush was telling me that I was stupid or
that the shooting was exciting or even enjoyable. As we drove away I could
hear  glass falling to the pavement. Just as we got out of the neighborhood
Tom had a great idea (or so I thought at the time) he said, "Hey, why don't
we go down to the car dealer place and fly by!"  So as dumb as I was I
thougt it would be a good idea.

	Now, we were coming up on the car dealership so I got the gun out
and got it ready. As we drove by again I only got one shot off but Tom  hit
about eight cars. We got out of there as fast as we could and headed back
to Tom's. By this time it was 11:30 and we were gonna start heading back to
my house. As Chuck took a wide screaching turn a cop pulled onto the same
street and pulled us over. The cop said that he got reports of a black
Firebird. He asked us to step out of the car. The cop then grabbed a pack
of four dozen eggs and smashed it against the seat. He said, "Ohh damn,
when  I was searching the car the eggs broke on accident."  Then the next
cop  started searching the passenger side he popped his head up and had a
gun  (which operated with CO2) in his hand. He said, "Now your going big
time." He said, "Is it loaded!"  Everything happened so fast I couldn't
remember, Tom was just as shocked. The cop put the gun up moving the aim
back and  fourth between Tom and I and said, "Is this loaded, if I pull the
fucking trigger will it blow off your fucking heads!"  I looked at Chuck
and told  him to say something he shouted out, "Yes!, Yes!."... The cop
smiled  because he noticed we were terrified. By this time there were four
cop cars there, and they took Chuck off to a car (I didn't see him until we
arrived at the station). 

                   	Here's where the injustice begins...

     	They cuffed Tom first putting the cuffs on so tight when they
took them off at the station we was bleeding and all whelted. Then a cop
comes up to me and says, "Put you hand on the car."  He then proceeded to
frisk me and found nothing else. As this was going on another cop who  was
searching the car again pulled up with my gun (which I hid really good).
Now the cop that was frisking me got angry about the other gun. He said,
"Put your hands behind your back!."  I thought he asked me to put my hand
on my head and when I put them there he punched me in the back of my head.
I fell against the back of the cop car and I didn't even feel it because I
was in shock. I then stood up from leaning over the car and put my hand
out,  he slapped the cuffs on and started dragging me to the cop car that
Tom was  already in. 

	As we came closer to the car he started asking me questions (now
let me remind you that he didn't read me my rights once). I answered in
simple  answers until he said, "What were you doing with the guns?"  I
didn't know what to say, so I said nothing. He got mad and slammed me into
the side of the car. I didn't know what to do so I just dropped. He then
picked me up and threw me into the side again. As I layed on the wet
pavement all thought gone from my mind I froze. After a second I started
getting up, he then kicked me, I fell down again (I was half way up to
begin with) he  then grabbed me up from the street and threw me in the car.
Tom said to me, "Holy shit, ary you alright?"  I told him, "Did you see
that?" He said, "He felt the car move!"
 
	As we took the ride to the station we were both silent, while  the
cop smoked a cigar and sang to the tunes on the radio he had on. We
arrived at the station in about five minutes. He then pulled us out of the
car and escorted us in. Just as I was entering I saw Chuck walking behind
us with his escort. We then went in and took a left, as we walked through
there was another cop coming the opposite way and he had a lunch in his
hand, he yelled, "Get the fuck out of my way punks, I'll put a bullet in
each of your heads!"  As he said this he pushed Tom against the wall and
kept on  walking. 

	The police man took us to the D.W.I. room and pushed us onto the
floor. (Now have you ever tried to lay down on your stomach with your hands
behind your back, it's not so nice on your face)  As I went down I banged
my face on the floor and let out a little whimper. We sat there for about
ten minutes not moving, not talking, then another cop comes in and asks us
all these questions, so he could fill out some form. He still never read me
my rights or anyone else's. Another cop comes in and says he called  all of
our parents and they're on the way. He then finger printed us and filled
out forms and such shit. 

	Finally they let us go into another room to see our parents. As  my
mom signed me out I got a big speech. In her speech she told me that the
cops said when they asked me where I got the gun I didn't answer them, they
didn't seem to mention that they asked me that when they were  banging me
against the car. This is a true story believe it if you want to.  I got my
court date in the mail and I have to go on January seventh. Wish me luck.
and thanx for listening or should I say reading.
        Bye all.....
