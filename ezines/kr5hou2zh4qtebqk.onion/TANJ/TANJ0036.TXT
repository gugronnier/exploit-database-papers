                            Giving Flamingo The Bird
                                       or
                   A Day In The Life of a Reservations Clerk
                               by Grinning Coyote

Today was the worst day of my life. I might as well have been fired. I was
suspended. The reason I was suspended is because I refused to wear a bra
and I was in a bad mood. Please note: This did not reflect over the phone
to customers. To them, I was cheerful (I received comments as such),
friendly, helpful, etc. All the things a good reservations clerk should be.

Let's face it, I don't have boobs worth talking about. We're talking about
a 52-A bra that doesn't exist. My back is huge, my boobs are smaller than
most men's pects that I know.

I've been given a 3 day suspension (comes to the rest of the entire week)
because they don't make a bra that fits me and I refuse to look like a
retard.

I got in at 3:00 am this morning in a fairly reasonable mood. The last
month or so has been getting on my nerves. I'd gone from "walking on water"
to "swimming in lead" at work -- let's face it, I was on the boss's shit
list because I did something that I wasn't properly trained to do
incorrectly. Anyway, I sat down to do bus summaries for the busses that
were coming in today and for the next two weeks. That's a laugh. I have to
struggle to keep one week out. Not because I'm slow, mind you, but because
the damned bus companies send in their fucking changes every single day up
to the last second!

For the first four hours, everything went fine. However, at 7:00 am, the
supervisor came in in a bad mood. She's been having problems with the
company not wanting her to go out with her security guard boyfriend because
she's a "suit" now. Big fucking deal, it's not her right to take her mood
out on me. I had one summary that had to be done for that day, and I didn't
find out about it until almost 7:20. Ohgeeohgollywow! I was supposed to
stop working on the damned things at 7:00 am, but, as everyone knows, there
are exceptions to everything. I told her I needed to do the summary, and
she started lecturing me about having to be done by 7:00. I told her that I
didn't find out about it till 7:20, and the bitch told me that it wasn't
her fault. I was in no mood for this, so I told her it wasn't mine either,
but it had to get done. She started bitching about it at me, so my final
response was "shit happens" (note: She's trying to get me canned by
claiming that I told her to kiss my ass. Well, at this point she
*CAN*!!!!), and I went to do the summary.

About 11:00 am, I get called into the manager's office and ripped a new
asshole about being insubordinate about telling the "wicked bitch of the
west" to kiss my ass (which, as I just stated above, I didn't do), and
because I had mentioned something to someone about the Hilton's SUPPOSED
policy of having to wear a bra (the actual line is "proper undergarments")
was "sexual discrimination", and that I would wear one when the men had to
because I didn't have enough boobs to deal with one.

I started to tell her the problem with the bra, and she interrupted me and
told me to listen and called me insubordinate to *HER* for wanting to
defend myself. Fuck her. I was not being insubordinate. She wants
insubordinate? Fine.

DO NOT STAY AT ANY HILTON HOTEL BECAUSE OF THE BULLSHIT WAY THEY TREAT
THEIR EMPLOYEES.

I'm tired of having brown lips (from kissing her goddamned ass!), and I
refuse to do so anymore! She *CAN* kiss my ass, and so can the entire
management of the Flamingo Hilton in Laughlin Nevada!!!!

I'm using my suspension time to look for another job, as 31.5 hours low on
my paycheck is something that my son and I cannot afford. I am a single
mother, and she is taking away from my bills. I don't really feel like
being thrown out of my house, nor do I feel like losing the phone, water,
gas, electric or cable (there are a total of 3 channels that TRY to come in
without the fucking cable). That means my kid doesn't eat. I don't care if
I eat or not...but she's taking food from an 8 year old, and I won't stand
for it.

I reach out to anyone and everyone who reads this to please contact the
Flamingo Hilton in Laughlin at 1-800-FLAMING and ask for Gary Gregg. Tell
him that Kate Regalado is a poor manager because she shows extreme
favoratism and prejudice in her department, and that the general moral of
the entire department has suffered for it.

Don't bother telling him where you heard it from -- I'm the only BBSer from
the Flamingo, and, until I find another job, I'd like to keep this one.

What I'm typing is not libel or slander, it is the honest truth. I have
heard from over 3/4 of the department complaining about Kate, Shannon, and
Patty.

I've been out in the work force for over 16 years now, and have never had
stress so bad that I had to get tranquilizers to keep me from punching out
a supervisor. Nowadays I'm on Xanax. This has been going on for over a
month, but this bra thing has me pissed. I'm going to the ACLU to sue the
Hiltons and her personally on a sex discrimination charge. Wish me luck.
