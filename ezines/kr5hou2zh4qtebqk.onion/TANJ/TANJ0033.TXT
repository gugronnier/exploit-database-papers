                           - Poetry Interlude 03 -
                         by the AC908 Poet's Society.

Okay. This TANJ file has perhaps the most authors of any single file to 
date, but it seems like everyone has seen fit to send me poetry this week.
So, the autors of this file are Cat Eye, Spectre, and Fringe, in pretty much
that order.

--------------------------------Cat Eye-------------------------------------

   Poems, poems and more poems.. that's all I seem to be doing lately.. 
every time I sit down, and I feel the urge to write, a poem flows from 
my finger tips.. deep in meaning and in thought, and since some of you guys
actually seem to like some of these poems, I am trying this again, more poems,
some recent, some not so.
   We'll start with the most recent.  Written yesterday as a matter of fact.  
I sat down in homeroom, usually I'd write a note to someone to kill time, 
but the previous night had brought me much thought, and wonderment, and when
I sat down in my seat to write a note, it became a poem.  I didn't know how 
else to say what I wanted to say.  I still don't.  But this poem made things 
a lot easier.  I'll end with the the least recent, and those poems that have 
no date, or dates I can't find.  Those also happen to be probably the most
boring, and least interesting, to me anyway.  But you know what they say,
everyone is their own worst critic!

--* A Look At You *--

When I look into your eyes
I see an ever forming pain
A look of hurt, need and of suffering
  I want to reach out and touch you
  Assure you I am real
  I want to reach out and feel you
  Let you know I am near
    I want to reach out and hug you
    To assure myself you are mine
    I want to reach out and kiss you
    Feel your lips touching mine
And when I touch your heart
I feel an irregular beat
A beat of anger, wonderment and of confusement
  I want to tell you I love you
  To help make you understand
  I want to tell you I care
  So that you know I am always there
    I want to tell you how I feel
    But I can't find the words
    I want you to feel for me
    The way I do for you.

      --Dedication: To Justin:
      I don't know how else to say what I mean,
    You understand that the feelings are undescrible
    that they mean so much, words can't express it!
    I know you needed to know how I felt, and this is
    one of the better ways I could think of doing it!

--* Bright Nothingness *--    10/11/92

Sitting, looking into total nothingness
An eerie feeling in complete blackness
Trapped, cornered, nowhere to run to
A captured state of being in utter silence
Screaming, so as not to feel so alone
Crying, so as not to feel so insecure
Running, hopping, skipping, jumping
So as not to feel so trapped
A sudden crack, a new sound
A sudden stream of steady light
A sudden feeling of hope, life returns
Another scream to get attention of an outsider
A yelp, scream and a holler
Pounding, banging and pleading
A new sound, the voice of someone
Quieting, talking aloud, pleasing for help
Hopes rising, depressed feelings fading
Her laughters of hopes echoes, turning into cries
The voice she heard was her very own
An echo, a game in her mind
Slumping to the floor she coils up
Clutching herself, trying to find inner strength
Hours seem to take years of feelings
A sudden outburst causes her to leap up
That one crack could become several
It could become bigger and better
The dim light shinning through brightened
She screamed and yelled
Pounded, pushed and pulled on the wall
Footsteps echoed on the outside
More pounding and beating joined in her efforts
The outside help helped greatly
The crack grew bigger, and greater
Once again the outside would could be seen
Kicking, shoving, pounding, pushing
Her excitement grew, but who was out there
She was eternally greatful to her new friend
An earbursting sound echoed, each stepped back
Crouching in a corner, ears and eyes covered
She cried as the wall crumbled to nothingness
Slowly is seemed to disinigrate, fade out of view
Her helper climbed through and picked her up
Brushing away all dirt and tears
He held her tight, never letting loose
He raised her faith, her hopes and her dreams
He slowly but surely introduced her to love
He sheltered her from all wrong and evil
Her blanket at night, her guide at day        

 --Dedication: To Justin:
 You've shown me a lot in our short
 time together.  You've torn down all
 of my barriors.  You've made me feel
 whole, complete.  You truely DO hold 
 the key to my heart for always!  
 I love you with all of my heart!
***********************

--* Nothing Before *--     9/16/92

You sat across from me
  That look of sweetness in your eye
You sat there silent, calm, and cuddled
  When parted I felt the urge to cry
I wanted to reach out, touch you
  Tell you everything would be fine
I wanted to hold you, and cradle you
  I needed to know you were mine

The days seem so long and cold
  I wonder how I last a day alone
Not having the warmth of your touch
  I miss looking into your eyes as they shine
The feeling of your hand over my heart
  Just that one touch, and my heart beats more
The feeling of being in your arms can't be explained
  You make me feel loved and free, like nothing before

  --Dedication:  To my love and my 
  everything-- Justin!

 --* Shine Happily *--    7/22/92

Bright and full of energy
Rising to awake the world
Taking its place in the skies
Shining happily; even alone

He remains there all day
Full of bright light and hope
Clouds passing him one by one
Still shinning happily; even alone

As he eventually becomes tired
He slowly sneaks away
Back from where he came
Still slighting shinning; even alone

Just as all other good things
That slowly comes to an end
The skies turn pink, purple, orange
And the sun can no longer shine

  --Dedication: To Jim Arico:
  You'll probably never see this, but
  that one night, July 22, 1992 I will
  never forget.. The walk on the beach,
  the first and last time we'll ever see
  each other.. I'd lost all hope in writing
  poetry, and you inspired me to start 
  again... You gave me faith in what I do
  best!  I thank you greatly! Virginia Beach
  is a memory always!

--* Puzzling Pain *--    5/24/92

Every night I sit here alone
I can think of nothing but you and I
I sit here alone, at heavens doors
And I realize the pain in my heart
Caused only by a shattering mirror
I try to gather the pieces on my own
Then, startled, I drop them again
Suddenly, I realize this game I'll never win
I was trying to put together a puzzle
A broken puzzle, the center piece missing
After looking at the puzzle, unfinished for hours
I've come to realize I can't replace the piece
Crumbled and torn apart
The puzzled is placed back in its box
Useless, uncared for, never thought of again
This puzzle brought forth only pain

  --Dedication:  To Paul:
  You might see this,t here's a good
  chance of it.. You never thought I
  could let you go.. I did.. This poem
  says it all!
*****************************

--* Memories *--

Memories are a thing of the past,
We must all find ways to make them last
Memories are special feelings,
Thoughts of creation and painful healings
Memories will always be with us
No way in the world could they escape 
Memories are our pride and joy
They can't be taken from girl or boy
Memories are what keep us going
They keep our feelings inside showing
No one can rid us of these
These thoughts are here, only to please
So take this moment and remember a piece of the past
A lost family member or friend, and make them last!

  --Dedication:  To my grandfather:
  I'll think of you always, even though
  you're not here, physically, you're still
  in my heart!  I'll always have your memories.
  Not only of you, but of everyone.. You helped
  inspire this one, you've been a great inspiration
  and where-ever you are!  I miss you and love you!
*****************************

--* Special *--

When the tear drops fall,
  I hate to say good-bye
It can be so very painful
  to see someone you love cry
As I wave and see you go,
  wonderful thoughts of you just flow
But while you're gone, I feel so low
  I just can't help being this mellow
But when you return,
  this all fades
The smile I see, and your wave,
  my spirits rise --
Because you're such a wonderful surprise!

  --Dedication: there is none amazingly.. 
  not that I can remember anyhow! But I 
  do remember it's Skyewalkers favorite!
*******************************

--* Laughter and Confusion *--

Laughter and confusion are two different things
Plain and simple, this can easily be seen
What used to be a wonderful laughter
Has all turned into a messy confusion
I used to think, it was all ok
That someday soon, it would all fade away
I've lived and I've learned
I've loved and been burned
But now I know, that this isn't right
I've learned my lesson and gained new height
It is time for me to ignore your harsh words
To move right on and learn the song of the birds
To be happy, and to be free, can't you see...
That is exactly how it should be!

 
--Dedication:  No one!

The Wall

Over and Over I throw myself at the wall
   A wall built brick bt brick by my fears
   anger, and hatred

   A wall held together by my love, desire
   and heart

once again I throw myself at the wall
  expecting nothing. yet, this time I feel a break
  a crack, a fault in the indominatlbe wall

once again I throw myself at the wall
  my body has no effect upon it, but my
  mind, my mind senses the Break

once again I throw myself at the wall
  not with my body as before
  with my mind
     a fault
     a crack
     an opening

once again I throw myself at the wall
   but to no avail, my mind is not strong 
   but my heart, my heart may be

once again I throw myself at the wall
   with my mind
   with my heart
   and with my body

  a sound, rushing air, the sound of freedom
  form my prison, my torture

Once agia I throw myself at the wall
  I meet nothing, I am free
  yet the freedom is different
   No sun
   No laughter
   No love

once again I throw myself at the wall
  no to escape my torment
  to return to it
   for I can live with the pain
       I can live with the loneliness
       I can live with the greif
  yet I cannot live without love, 
                    without laughter
                    without sun

once again I throw myself at the wall

                       inspired by Tal Meta


do you know where you are?
do you know what you are?
do you even exist?
do you even care?

I can not speak for you.
I can speak for myself.

I am Fringe.

I exist.

"Is a thought about a unicorn a real thought?"

I think I exist.
I exist.
I exist even if only as a figment of my imagination.

I live in the world.
I exist in the world.
I exist in my imagination.
My imagination is my world.

The world is in my imagination.

The imagination exists in the mind that imagines it.
I imagine imagination.
Imagination exists in my mind.

Imagination sets the patterns of the mind.
The mind controls the imagination.
It is within my ability to control my mind.
It is within my ability to control my imagination.
The world exists within my imagination.
It is within my ability to control the world.

"The ability to act conveys the responsibility to do so."

I have the ability to change the world.
I have the responsibility to do so.

I can speak only for myself.

You must speak for you.
