                                   - POWER -
                               By Personal Jesus

I am your only god.

Pretty sweeping statement, huh? But its accurate. I *DO* own you, and I
have since the day of your birth. I have existed since before your
ancestors learned to stand upright, and I'll be here when the cockroaches
launch their first spaceship.

I own you, and you don't even realize it. I've offered you choices, but
they aren't really choices, because in the end, there is only really me,
staring back at you.

You wake up in the morning, and you begin to serve me. You clean yourself
because I have told you that being dirty is wrong. You clothe yourself
because I have told you that being naked is obsene. You got to school
because that is your path to getting a job, and earning money, becuase you
know, deep down, that earning money will bring you closer to me. But it
won't, because I have rigged the game against you. And even if you've
realized THAT, you still will go to work, because its already too late to
stop playing my game. You'll go on playing it, because you feel deep down
that you can beat me. But you can't.

Consider this: you go to work, and you earn money. But I take some before
you even see your paycheck. Then, when you try and spend it, I take some
more. Very clean, very neat. I'm glad I thought of it.

When you talk to other people, you almost never mention my name. You sit
there, reading this file, wondering where its going. What if its going
nowhere? You'll still read, because I have your attention now.

I own Bush. I own Clinton & Perot too. Of the three, only Perot knows I own
him. He freely admits it. He offered to become your president, and not
accept a paycheck, because he knows I own him. Its not about money. Its
about me.

Did I say I own your prospective rulers? They are pretty interchangeable,
you know. Each of the three says that they are different from the other,
but they aren't really. They are merely different faces of me. None of them
will do a thing to improve your lot, but they WILL do a great deal to
improve their own. Each in their own special way, of course.

So, I own you. You can run from me, but in the end, I will always find you.
You can offer yourself to me. I won't care. There are millions offering
themselves to me every day.

Some of my other followers have their own TV shows. They'll promise to help
you reach me. But they're really using you to help themselves reach me.
They ask you to send them donations, what little free money you have left.
And you send it to them. Millions of dollars every year. They spend it on
fancy cars, and fancy homes, and they never get their hands dirty. They do
not want. They serve me so perfectly. They tell you what you want to hear.
And because its what you want, you'll gleefully send them more money, just
to give your life a little illusion of purpose aside from serving me.
They're just doing it better than you. They deserve your money, in a way.

I watch your kind in rapt fascination. You think you are so strong, so
powerfull. You are nothing. I have legions of followers. They will crush
you like a bug if you ever become a threat to me. And the best part is, 99%
of them won't even realize that they're doing it for me. They'll say
they're doing it for God, or for their country, or because you're sick, and
need help. But come they will, and they will crush you. And I'll laugh. At
you, and at them.

The Medicine Man understood me. So did the High Priest. And so does the
Politician. And the Doctor, and the Lawyer. Anyone who has set themselves
apart from the mass of your kind understands me. They even fight among
themselves, quarreling over how I am to be served. They never see that
merely acknowlegeing me serves me more perfectly than all the laws,
prayers, dances, or drugs will ever do.

Television was my greatest invention. I won't be happy till everyone has
one. It allows me such direct access, and it lets me mold your children
directly. I show them useless toys, that they would otherwise never want,
and they will scream and scream until you buy them one. And then, after
awhile, it will join the stack of other useless toys I've made you buy. And
what I start in the child, I magnify in the adolescent. I tell you how to
dress, I tell you where to shop. I show you what you must do to be
accepted. I show you how to style your hair, and what clothes to wear, and
I offer you a million examples of what you must do to "measure up" to what
society expects of you. I tell you a million different useless things, and
in your mindless efforts to serve me, you eat it up like the most
deliscious meal ever set before a King.

I tell you what is beautiful. I tell you what is trendy. I tell you what
your perfect weight is, and I make sure everyone else knows it too. I set
every standard you live your life by, and I make you like it. I teach you
how to think. I tell you how to brush your teeth, and with what, and how
often. I tell you that you'll never attract the opposite sex unless you buy
this, or wear that, or cut your hair a certain way. My ultimate servant,
television is. It allows my other servants to reach you as well.

And once you become an adult, I tell you how to live all over again. I tell
you how to vote, and I tell you what to buy. I tell you how to live every
facet of your life, and you never question. Thats the best part of all. If
you see something on the evening news, you automatically accept that it is
true. My servants tell you that "this food is bad" and you accept it. They
tell you that the stock market did this, or that, and you pretend to chart
your life around it.

So you can run, but you cannot hide. Rail against me all you like, I will
still possess you in the end. There are those that try to fight me, but
like the Hippies of the '60s, I eventually corrupt them, and bring them
into line. So stop struggling. Just give in, and live your life for me. I
offer you such peace. You won't need to think, as my servant. Thinking is
HARD, remember that. And you have to do it all the time. Let me do your
thinking for you. Let me plot the course of your life, and you'll be ever
so much happier. I already have people in place, waiting to make your every
decision for you. So go to church, and vote republican. Or vote democrat.
It makes no difference really. Just find one of my servants, walk right up
to them, and offer your life to them. They'll accept. They'll make all
those nasty decisions for you. And you'll be free to enjoy living in the
cage I've built for you.

Oh, by the way, my name is POWER....
