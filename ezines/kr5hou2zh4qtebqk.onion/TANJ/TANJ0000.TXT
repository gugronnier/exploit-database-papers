                                 -Afterthoughts-

I realized recently that I had neglected to publish the writers guide for folks
wishing to write under this banner.Well,here they are.

First off,what I am mostly looking for are stories. They can be fictional or
true,but the main thrust of this newsletter is to entertain & inform,not bore
people to tears with a million lists and diagrams. The stories also have to
be original. I am not in the business of reprinting other peoples work.
So if 90% of your story has been buffered from another source, this is not the
banner you want to write for. (But I can suggest a few who won't mind. :) )
Stories dealing with 'justice' (or a lack thereof) have the best chances for
acceptance, but anything is permissable.

The file must be written in plain ASCII, single spaced, with wordwrap OFF.
This means it should have a return character every 80 columns or so. If I have
to reformat the file in any way,it will be rejected. It would be nice if words
that you are not INTENTIONALLY misspelling (like fone, phreak, or phriend) were
spelled correctly. 

Okay...you have a file that meets all of the above criteria. Now how to get
it published? Thats relatively simple. First,you need to be a user on my BBS.
When you are ready to submit your file,simply upload it to the "UPLOADS"
directory with a filename of TANJXX.TXT (in which the "XX" stands for your
user ID number). Within a day or two you should have heard from me one way
or another.If you have a whole slew of files you wish to submit (providing they
have not been released under some other banner previously) use the format
"TANJXX-Y.TXT" where "XX" is your user # and "Y" is the number of the file you
are submitting. Also,please incluse an alternate title that you would wish to
use in the event that I don't wish to publish it...I will still put it in the
textfiles section under that filename.

I would also like to announce that ALL TANJ FILES ARE AVAILABLE HARDCOPY!
For further info,please contact me via BBS, or via TLSNetmail for prices
and other babble.
