                             - An Off-Road Brain -
                                 by Spartacus


Today I went to the mall. Not to hang out. To buy something. I needed a
ride. I went with my mom. We went in. We bought. We came back out. There
was a woman who had laid a baby on a car hood. It was crying because of the
heat of the metal against its skin this unseasonably hot day. She was
changing it's diaper.

Of course, my mother, fundamentalist Christian and good little citizen that
she was, felt the need to protest. "Imagine exposing the poor thing out
there in public like that. It's so crass." (Slightly paraphrased because I
can't remember the words.) Good citizen, upholding the public morality.
Let's all give her a hand.

                                 *** STOP! ***

Can you see what's wrong with this picture?

See baby. See baby being changed. See baby being changed on car hood. See
car hood fry baby like egg. Complain about crass exposure of baby's unclean
backside????

I tried to explain to her. Who cares about the fucking parking lot??? It's
not as if it were a busy day and there were many people out there. Probably
get more traffic in a bathroom. She wouldn't listen. "I still think it's
crass." Yay society.

Society is probably the worst thing for us. We should all just abolish all
this crap. Total anarchy. Run around and kill everyone. Just like war, only
you don't even have to leave home. Weed out a lot of bad seeds this way,
before a government is reestablished. Do this a few times, most of humanity
might even be able to live WITHOUT killing each other. Wishful thinking
maybe. I think it's at least worth a try. More than more weapons, more than
more technology, more than more money, food, democracy, paper, children,
space, anything...what we need is people who think for themselves. Who can
agree to disagree. Who don't feel that their way is the only way. Who can
stop to think about each other as people and not things. Whose care is
stronger than their weak stomachs and distaste.

Most people, whether you accept it or not, are like livestock. A few people
have it together. They're the ones who see we are sheep, and don't like it.
Want to do something about it. Want to at least get it out of their own
lives. Then there are the worst people. The totalitarian and religious
fanatics. The ones who see we are sheep, and like it that way. Then there
are the confused masses inbetween, who muddle their way through life never
knowing or really much caring what it is about. They follow and think they
lead. They serve and think they are masters. They muddle about in the
darkness having never opened their eyes.

Most people follow. Nearly all. They follow a lot of different leaders.
Follow God. Follow the Pope, let him follow God. Follow Hitler. Follow
Satan. Follow the trends, those rippling waves that wash to and fro through
society. Follow Allah (just another form of God). Everyone following
something. Then there are the leaders. Most leaders are followers. Follow
money, follow power for its own sake. Just something the very society they
were born into leads them to want to have. They follow the dead leaders
that preceded them. Goes back to the founding leader. He started something
for some reason. Very often because he was following the values of another
leader of something totally different.

A few leaders are not followers. They lead themselves, and others too. But
they are very few. Thre are reasons, of course. There seems to be a reason
for almost everything. Usually a dumb reason, but there nevertheless.
Someone who thinks for himself is very uncomfortable for conformist cattle
to be around. They bring new ideas, follow values different than society.
They have to find a group of wanna-be followers, people that can't fit in
with the current society, but still want to fit in, want something or
someone they can follow. Then the freethinker has to get them to follow
HIM. This is a very hard thing for a lot of people. And any such new
movement is likely to be crushed by oppression from the existing order. All
these groups and religions and hierarchies and government and such have one
thing in common: a monomaniacal desire for MORE FOLLOWERS! What's the
point? There is none. I guess it's what the first guy wanted who started
religions/governments (yes, they used to be one and the same) and no one
else came up with a new idea. Conformists who become leaders are known for
their lack of creativity. We'll never really know though. It probably
happened far before history could tell us. 

Another reason: a lot of freethinkers don't want to be leaders anyway. They
want people to be themselves, not try to emulate, obey, or serve them.
Sometimes they'll take these things as second choice anyway tho.

Yes, another reason: there aren't too many freethinkers anyway. We've
always been rare, and had an appalingly short life expectancy. The bastards
who CURRENTLY run the world don't like us. Niether do most of the people.
They never have. They brand us lunatics, heretics, seditionists,
insurrectionists, enemies of the people. When only among us can be found
the people's true friends. They lie to themselves and lash out at us when
we speak the truth. They have locked us up, suppressed us, brainwashed us,
given us electroshock therapy, and killed us in thousands of ways, varying
widely in their cruelty. We have been killed by mobs. We have been killed
by isolated individuals. We have been killed by the Spanish Inquisition. We
have been killed by soldiers and policemen. We have been killed by
executioners after a trial by grand jury.

Just a brief note: while I was writing that paragraph, there was a bit of
an interruption. My sister wanted the computer to type something for
school. I hate when that happens when I'm writing. When I'm REALLY writing.
I have something I need to say and the words flow out onto the page as fast
as my fingers can type them. When I'm spilling the contents of my soul or
mind or heart or all three into the computer, paper, or whatever. When I
really have to say it. There is a driving force, a compulsion. I HAVE to
write and I hate being interrupted. I feel like my fingers are bleeding
from being pulled from the keyboard. I felt like I had to break something
but instead I just walked outside and watched all the people. All the
people I was watching looked at me. They looked nervous. People aren't used
to anyone actually giving a shit about them, being interested in what they
are doing, so they figure I must be stalking them or something. See, do
anything society doesn't think is "normal", it doesn't matter if it's good
or bad, people hate you for it.

Now back to your regularly unscheduled textfile...

--- Yes, there has been a program going on among the establishment, all the
varying forms of the establishment, as long as history records, to destroy
all of us, to eliminate us from the gene pool. It is a plan every bit as
subtle as a left hook. No wonder most people don't really realize it. The
leaders have been breeding EVERYONE to be conformist, to be dependent, to
be cattle.

If you are the pope or a minister or president or premier or dictator or
cop or district attorney or executioner or "good clean citizen" who doesn't
like all this stuff, because you are too blindly loyal to your country
("patriotic") I have a special message for you from us. The few. The
enlightened. The thinkers. Beings complete within themselves. WE KNOW YOU
ARE KILLING US, WE KNOW YOU ARE SUPPRESSING US, WE KNOW WHAT A THIN FLIMSY
VEIL THE ILLUSION OF FREEDOM IN THE "FREE WORLD" REALLY IS. Much as we'd
like you to stop, we are NOT afraid of your fucking guns, or your weapons,
your witch hunts, your police, your prison camps. 

We have ONE THING you don't have and CAN NEVER HAVE  
(or you wouldn't be what you are),  
and it is our sword  
and our shield  
and our light  
and our darkness  
and our day  
and our night 
and our country  
and our government
and our constitution 
and our right  
and our wrong  
and our strength  
and our weakness  
and our life  
and our death  
and our heaven  
and our hell
and our god  
and our devil  
and our only truth  
and our only law  
and the one thing that cannot be taken  
and cannot be given,  
and that is OURSELVES.  
We have ourselves. 
We don't need you. 
Fuck you all. 
Fuck your leaders. 
Fuck your ancestors. 
Fuck your money. 
Fuck your respect. 
Fuck your laws. 
Fuck your gods.

"I'm free up HERE!" said, Bozo, the crippled broke pavement artist in
George Orwell's "Down and Out in Paris and London." Read Orwell. He knows
his shit. Maybe you'll learn something. Maybe it'll lead you to finding
yourself. Then you'll be one of us.

Read Ibsen's "Enemy of the People" too. I really liked it. It has a nifty
and controvesial message. Don't reject it just because it may offend you.
Think it out. Truth hurts sometimes.

I was raised in the Christian faith. Later, as you probably see by now, I
rejected it completely. The Bible says, "Love your neighbor as yourself."
Most Christians I know don't seem to love other people for shit. I know I
didn't.

I love people, in general, more now than I did then. I love them enough to
offend them and curse at them and whatever it takes, to maybe wake them up
from their complacency and let them know themselves for what they are, and
work from there.

I hate people too. Love and hate are really two sides of the same coin.
Contempt is really the true opposite of both love and hate. You don't
really give a shit. I do that too. It depends on my mood. Sometimes it
varies over less than thirty seconds. But still I love people more than I
did as a Christian type. You can't really love someone, I think, unless you
own yourself. If you are a follower you are too wrapped up in the system to
have anything of yourself to give. Same goes for hate. But you can't really
contempt either. You are too much wrapped up in everyone else for true
contempt. True warm perfect love, true rabid killing hate, true
wipe-you-out- of-my-plane-of-existence contempt, are all unknown to the
masses. They haven't the internal resources. Always stuck in neutral
really, wobbling about with half-feelings. Usually someone else's
half-feeling, at that.

Wake up. Look. Listen. Think. Act. You make the rules when you form your
own opinions. It hurts, but it's worth it.

Think.
