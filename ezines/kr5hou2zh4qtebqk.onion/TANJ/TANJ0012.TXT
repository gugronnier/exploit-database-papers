                                -The Family Pool-
                                   by Urethris

	The air had the crisp smell of the oncoming autumn as I strode down
the street, kicking a stone along the way. The leaves were starting to turn
and squirells darted to and frow instinctively as they prepared for the
hardships they had yet to endure. As I watched them I wondered how easy it
would be to kill one. Without a second thought I put my school bags down
and crept beneath a young sapling which was taking part in giving the
squirrels a way from the ground to the tree in which they resided. How
slowly I walked...it seemed it took me forever to reach the young oak, but
I went unnoticed.

	With lightning speed I lashed out and hit the tree with a solid
round house,  sending about 4 of the little critter sprawling to the
ground. One unlucky ball of fluff landed at my feet and before it could get
its bearings I snatched it. The poor furry animal clawed and scratched at
my hand but to no avail. With a frim twist of my wrist I snapped its neck
and put it in my neighbor's mailbox, laughing to myself as I imagined
theire shocked faces when they found this special delivery. As I started to
walk away I could have sworn I heard someone say "good." I quickly spun on
my heels, but there was no one there. Must have been the wind.

	When I reached my house I let myself in as I usually did and went
up to my room. I was feeling a little tense, so I proceeded to do what most
adolecant boys do and I jerked off. When I was right in the middle of
things I saw my dog walk in. He was a 6 year old black mut that I had found
a few years back. The dog sat down and watched, funny I thought, that I
might have an audience. When I knew I was ready to cum I waddled over to
the dog and blew my wad right in its face. He just licked it all up. Dogs
really will eat anything.

	Then I heard the chariot, mom's car. She came in the house fuming
mad , over what I had no idea. Without a word she turned to me and smacked
me in the face with the cheese grater she was holding. As I lay on the
floor holding my bloody face she bellowed "You lazy fuck! You were supposed
to mow the Goddam lawn!" I knew it was my brother's turn to do it but I
didn't dare to utter a word. She continued "I don't know why I ever had you
you worthless piece of shit!" With that she kicked me hard in the side, i
thought i heard a crack as she did so.

	After the lawn was done, my stepfather arrived home. He was
obviously drinking previous to his arrival and was raving like a lunatic.
He saw my mother first and threw her to the floor, "That piece of shit sonn
o' yours left the toiet seat up this morning! AGAIN!" Mom looked to me and
all I could do was acknowledge the accusation with a slight nod. I was so
afraid. I knew what was coming next....the mallet. He grabbed me by the arm
and brought me to the tool shed, swearing and cussing all the way. When we
arrived, he proceeded to cuff me to the tool bench. Then out came the
mallet and the board. He laid the wood upon my chest and holding the mallet
high in his right hand, slammed it down with all his might. The wind rushed
out of me and an explosive pain eru[ted in my abdomen.

	I don't know what time it was when I came to...it was dark. I was
still shackled to the bench and there were no signs of anyone coming to get
me. Once in a while I would hear shouting from the house, but that was it.
The quietness hung in the air like a thick smog, and the shadows in the
shed began to look like mutilated bodies "ENOUGH!" I yelled. I was cracking
up. The night wore on and I remained a prisoner in that damn shed. Late
that night I gave into my weariness and went to sleep.

	The passing hours turned into days. I was dehydrating. I knew I
would die. No one would get me. I heard a voice say "The time has come. I
will give you the strength." I pulled with all my might and amazingly, my
hand slipped out of the handcuffs. I knew who my nemisis was. I looked
around. The shadows pointed to a phillips head screwdriver laying on a
shelf, complying with my orders, I took it in my hand and proceeded toward
the house. I noticed how skinny I had grown and cursed Jesus for letting me
rot in there! Ahh... the back door...the gateway. Silently I slid it open,
picturing myself as a cat on the prowl. I turned to go down the hallway
when a pair of arms was around me. I recognized them as my mother's. She
flung me around and jabbed a fork into my arm squealing "Your pennance
isn't up! GET BACK IN THERE!" The fork transformed into a snake and slowly
began to spiral up my arm. My mother's face contorted into an unspeakable
monstosity and I fell to my knees, overcome by it all. She immediately
pounced, punching and clawing, we rolled aroung and I manged to get my arm
up. The snake was alomost at my neck now,  but then it stopped.

	I looked up at mom and she stopped fighting, her eyes rolling back
into her head. It was then that I realized the screwdriver was buried 5
inches in her skull. Blood poured out onto me. The voice was back. It said
"Yes. This is right" The dog, alerted by the struggle, bounded in and
proceeded to sop up the blood that was freely oozing from my dead parent's
mortal wound.

	That was when I saw my Step father's shape, silhoetted against the
dim moonlight, coming at me. The dog, who was quite excited by all this,
jumped in the way and knocked my step dad off balance. He fell right on top
of the corpse and sent the screwdriver in all the way. There was a
sickening pop and mom's head split open like a ripe melon. Brain tissue
spilled out onto the carpet and the dog continued on his feast.
Unperturbed, my nemsis, my mortal enemy, stood up and put me in a bear hug,
squeezing with all his might.

	"You are the stronger" said the voice. I felt my back crack not
once, but 4 times. I was loosing consiousness. "You are the stronger" the
voice repeated. I gathered everylast ounce of strength I had left and
jammed my left forefinger into his eye, but he still held fast. I pushed
with all my might, forcing my finger deeper and deeper into his eye socket,
twisting and turning it, doing anything I could to go farther in. During
the struggle, I noticed that there was a pool of blood forming from my
mother's new anterior crack. I had always wanted a swimming pool, ironic
that the sam parent that always refused was becoming the pool herself.

	My step father was slowly tiring out, and with my last breath I
managed to grab the back of his head and force it forward. He shook
violenty and began to spit up blood. Then he released his grip and fell to
the floor writhing. Quickly I ran upstairs and found his revolver. Somehow
my brother had slep through it all. I went into his room to make sure he
was really asleep....He never felt the bullet hit him.

	I went back downstairs to find my enemy convulsing in our new
family pool. Yes, the FAMILY POOL! I went and fetched my brother right
away. When I had him downstairs I cut his belly open s he could make a
donation. I looked to the dog, licking up the remains of my family. I tired
to aim for between his eyes, but I missed. Instead I got him in the
shoulder, totally blowing off his front left leg and severy mangling the
rear left. He tried to run, but all he could do was go in bloody circles,
tearing off peices of flesh as he did so. I threw him into the middle of
the pool, his stirring helped give it a Jicuzi effect.

	That was when I heard the sirens, saw the lights shining through
the front of the house. "Do it." Said the voice. "Do it" it repeated. The
cops were banging on the door. There was no time.I looked at my loving
family and made my decision. That night, at 2:34am, after I had single
handedly slaughtered my family, a single shot rang out, followed by a
splash.
