                       Blood Lust 1¬: The Victim's Story
                              by Metonymous Bosch

(I am Anonymous' smarter, better-looking older sister. So my kid brother
thinks he can write, huh?)


"Vampire Slasher Still At Large!' read the newspaper headline. I tossed the
paper into the recycling bin; its descriptions of the latest victims'
mutilated bodies were too vague, not detailed enough to titillate me. I was
bored and sexually frustrated; my most recent boyfriend had left me last
week. He said I was too kinky for him, that my obsession with violence and
blood turned him off. Well, maybe that was his excuse, because his sexual
performance wasn't that great anyway. I wanted something graphically gory.
Sighing, I picked up the Anne Rice novel I'd been trying to read.

In the background, the TV news repeated the headlines about the "Vampire
Slasher", and how he'd killed several people in this neighborhood just within
the last week. My door was open. The screen door was unlatched. I was sitting
near the door, quite visible, and wearing only my aqua silk negligee, the
sexiest thing I owned. I sat with my legs apart, so that the scent of my
sexual arousal mixed with the blood aroma from my period would drift out the
screen door to the hypersensitive nostrils of the predator who prowled the
night.

Tonight would be the night. I knew it. He was coming for ME. I could sense
that he was nearby, hiding in the bushes next to my house. Why was he taking
so long to make his move? Just the thought of him so close was almost
unbearably arousing. I set down my book and rearranged my negligee, so that
my breasts were almost completely exposed; the silk covered only my nipples,
which were growing stiff with excitement as the silk slid over them. I
started to caress myself, but stopped; I should save my arousal for HIM. The
dull ache in my lower belly began to throb in time to my pulsebeat (even
though I get cramps, I'm always horny when I have my period).

There was a sudden soft noise in the shrubbery next to the door. I leaned
back in my chair, and my robe fell open at the top, exposing my breasts
completely. I closed my eyes. The screen door thumped, and I heard his
footsteps as he came to me.

"It's you..." I moaned, "It's finally you...I've been waiting for you, it
seems like my whole life." He said nothing. I felt a cool, delicate tingle as
his knife cut the silk away from my trembling flesh. It took all my
self-control not to reach for him as I would have reached for a mortal lover.
The icy tingle of his knife point became a line of purest flame as he began
to carve mystical patterns into my flesh. I opened my eyes; I didn't want to
miss any of this.

He began to lick the blood that oozed from the mysterious lines he had cut
upon my breasts. I shuddered uncontrollably with the mixture of agony and
ecstasy he was inflicting upon my body. When he licked and then bit first one
nipple, then the other, I could not control myself any longer. I cried out,
and my body arched against him as I had one of the most explosive orgasms of
my life.

He let me rest for a moment, while my convulsive gasping settled down. I saw
that he was naked, and that his erection was bigger than most men's. There
was something hypnotic about the way his penis throbbed slowly, its stately
rhythm almost mocking my ragged breathing. I wanted to touch it. But when I
reached for it, he violently grabbed both my wrists in one hand and pinned
them so that I could not move. I knew his strength was greater than any human
being's. I did not resist him, and I didn't want to.

Then his knifework began again. This time, he carved his intricate lines and
hieroglyphics into the flesh of my thighs and belly. I could no longer tell
the difference between pleasure and pain. Both were unbearable, and both were
what I craved more than life itself. Our bodies were slippery with blood and
sweat; sometime before, I don't remember when, I had fallen to the floor,
where he continued to work on me with the strange artistry of evil.

My eyes were closed again, as he drove my body closer to death and ultimate
pleasure. Every stroke of the knife excited me more and more. I wasn't sure
whether it was his penis or his knife that plunged deep inside my vagina. It
was ice-cold, it was fever-hot, it caused me pain beyond human comprehension,
and I wanted to embrace it with my internal muscles and never let it go. I
felt myself about to have another mind-destroying orgasm.

He grabbed a handful of my hair and roughly shook my head. "Open your eyes!"
he commanded. I did, to see the tip of his knife gleaming less than a quarter
of an inch away from my eyeball. So it was his cock I was  desperately
clutching with my pussy. As he thrust deep inside me, he thrust the knife
into my eye. I screamed, and I felt his erection tighten within me. He was
about to come too. I was glad.

The point of the knife blade was now poised over my remaining eye. I watched
it intently. It dripped blood and fluids onto my face. My body  strained
against his, as we lay locked in an embrace of fear and pain and lust and
evil magic. Slowly he moved the knife closer and closer to my eyeball, until
it actually touched the surface without puncturing it.

His body was shaking; so was mine. With a sudden cry of triumph he thrust his
cock deeply into me, and at the same time he plunged the knife into my
eyeball and through the eyesocket to what lay behind.

And death came in my brain, and we were one...
