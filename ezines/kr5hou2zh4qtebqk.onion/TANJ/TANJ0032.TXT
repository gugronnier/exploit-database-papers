hey hey hey, here comes halloween. do you know what you'll be this year? i
know. you'll probably be the same spineless conformist you were last year.
and the year before. and every other year. the only thing that's different
is the year.

      .---.

 check out tanj #29 by spartacus!? my (non-existant) god, it's inspirational.

so here i am, looking at this neat little college rundown booklet sort of
thing. it lists all these great (?) colleges in new jersey and the average
amount of brains & funds needed to get into one. now, ladies and gentlemen,
some of you may not know my current situation. let me explain it for you..
i work a drudging 25-30 hours a week at a mild $5.50 per hour. this figures
out to be (after taxes and all) to be something around $120 per week. that
figures out to be about $6240 per year. now, the average american makes
about $30000 or so per year, so i'm a little under par to begin with. then
again, this is just a penny-anny job, not a career. fine. ok. i can live
with it. now. expenses. i'll need to pay insurance. let's figure about
$1000 per year, give or take. that's $5240 i've got. let's figure on gas.
maybe.. $10 per week? that's $520 per year. that's $4720.

now, let's look at schools.

(note: i have no idea what i want to waste the rest of my life on, so i
plan on taking whatever classes blow my skirt up, so to speak.)

first, we have the legendary (?!) brookdale community college. you need a
measley $1462 per year, plus $60.95 per credit. i don't seem to have any
idea how many credits i'd be taking, so i'll figure some high amount or so.
so, let's pretend it would cost me roughly $2000 per year. now, $4720 -
$2000 is $2720. and let's just divide that by 52 weeks, shall we? $52.31.
fifty two fucking dollars, do you see that? i'm supposed to fit food,
savings, and pocket cash into there? how? someone tell me, i'm a little
lost.

and if the college goes over $2000 per year, jesus.. forget it.

from this, we can draw two simple rules for life:

 .] if mom & dad didn't attend college, neither will you for lack of funds.
..] the more higher education a nation makes available, the stronger the
    nation will be. (see japan, china, all the other countries that are
    currently beating the pants off us in the electronics field, automobile
    production, face it, just about everything you can think of..)

this isn't even taking into account the fact that i'll be working a lot
less when college starts. that slashes that $120 figure all to hell.

what? get a new job? something that pays more? is that what you're saying?
go fucking look. $5.50 is like a fortune compared to $5.05, the glorious
minimum wage.

tanj in your bed..

well, i could always scrap the idea of saving and money. and i suppose i
could give up on eating. that would provide me with some money. that would
also wipe out any chance of attending school the year after. no savings =
no money for next year. and that equals nothing.

frankly, i still would have voted for brown.

heyheyheyheyheyheyhey. i like the way they shut out what's his face, i
forgot his name. he's running for president, too. third party, one of those
libertarian parties, or something like that. pardon my ignorance. still,
it's just peachy keen the way they wouldn't let him attend any debates,
even though his name is on the ballot in all 50 states. it's like the
establishment is saving "my way, or no way.."

gee, this dosen't make me love amerikkka much.

hey you. yes, you. you ever saw a child in a supermarket? he always wants
something. always whining for something. what does mom do? she promises him
he'll get it, in a little while. or she tells him he has some at home. and
what does junior do? he shuts up. he's content to know that he already has
whatever, even if he really dosen't.

anyone see the relation yet?

they say we have these great freedoms, then they turn around and arrest us
for using them. they say we have the right to assemble, but have you ever
tried? when there are 3 or more people, you constitute a mob. they can
arrest you. some assembly.

they say "amerikkka, land of the free!" and what do we do? we stick our
thumb back in our mouth (or is that up our ass?) and glop on through our
lives, content to think that we have "inalienable human rights." and what
do we really have? we have our hands cuffed behind our back, our necks in a
leash, and are being told what to do by the mas'a. gee, it's flashbacks to
slavery, isn't it? just because the slave was free to roam the property,
that dosen't mean the slave had freedom. just because we're free to roam
the united states, that dosen't make us free, either.

people look at the old days, germany, russia.. when you needed papers to
travel anywhere. and they think, how awful. those poor people. they aren't
free at all. and they don't even think about their own situation, and how
their lives are on a tether, too.

and i quote the dead kennedys, "life sentence"..

  "you're a chained-up dog fenced in a yard
   don't see much, you can't go far
   pace & froth, you're getting sick
   run too fast & it'll snap your neck"

go out. buy "high priest of harmful matter- tales from the trial" by jello
biafra. listen. think. think about what you're doing before you vote for
clinton and put tipper gore that much closer to national power. get with
it, cattle. this is your wake-up call. if you don't think about things you
become part of the problem. having main-stream values & ideas isn't a bad
thing, just so long as you think about them and agree with them. if you
ride with the tide.. you're just dead wood. you're just DEAD.

 "you say yes, you say no, it makes a difference.."

i should go and dry my laundry. that's what i should do. and wash my
blankets. and brush my teeth. and brush my hair. and wash my face. and wash
my body. and deodorize myself. and clear the dirt out from under my nails.
and trim my nails. and file my nails. and pluck the hair out of my
nostrils. and pick out nice, neat, non-offensive clothes. and put them on.
and wear them in whatever fashion is currently trendy and widely accepted.
and i should clear my mind of all thought. and remain indifferent. and be a
number. and be a thing. and become a walking body part surplus. and waste
my life. and waste my mind. and let whatever talents i have slip away. and
not question anything. because if you ask a question, there may not be an
answer. and that requires thought. and thoughts are bad. thoughts ruin an
otherwise perfect conformist mind. "exterminate all rational thought."

fuck you. fuck that. i am who i am, and i refuse to be anyone else. i'll
think what i want, do what i want, and be whatever i choose. so to hell
with you.

sometimes i wonder if i would've been happier if i'd never stopped and
questioned things. if i just blindly believed.

no.. i don't think so..

you've got tanj on your breath..

 "death by manipulation!"

i feel like a fool for worrying about money so much. i hate money. i hate
the way today's society builds money (and sex, of course) up to be the
greatest thing in the world.

and yet, i have to worry about money. because i have to worry about
education. because education = clout. without it, you're nothing. if you
don't have some sort of a neat phd or similar meaningless dribble attached
to your name, it gives people the right to not take you seriously. bless
you, kurt vonnegut, jr. i think you've taught me something.

and with a message like this, i will not be ignored. i will not be put
aside as a kook. people will hear, damn it, people will listen. if they
like it or ot.

once you set your alarm clock, you have no choice but to hear it. it's on
the other side of the room, and no one wants to get out of bed to turn it
off. so hey listen to it blare.

society turned me on. and now i'm on the other side of the room. and if
society is too fucking lazy to get up and smash me down, then i will be
heard. WE will be heard.
