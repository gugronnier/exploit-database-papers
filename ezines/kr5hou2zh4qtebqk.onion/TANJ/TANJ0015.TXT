                              - "Terrible Lie" -
                                 by Tal Meta   

A few months ago, I wrote a TANJfile titled "On the Origins of Derf". Now
in the interests of fairness, I will admit that I told my side of the
story, as I saw it. However, there is to every story another side. So, I
am going to give my loyal readership a view INSIDE the insidious Angel's
Lair, where the mighty Derf himself has seen fit to regale his users
with his version of the events leading up to various things. Once his
say is through, I will give a quick synopsis of the actual calendar of
events, and y'all can decide for yourselves which of us is the holder of
the sacred truth.

I have stripped away such nonsense as post headers, user I.D.'s and post
dates. Anyone interested in such trivia is offered the opportunity to
call Angel's Lair and see for themselves. I have left all of Derf's
numerous & copious spelling errors intact, so that you might get the
"flavor" of Derf in all its glory.

And so begins the "Terrible Lie"...

--------------------------------------------------------------------

Kaos Kidd (aka Derfimus Maximus, the One True Derf, etc., etc..)

As for the Tal stuff, HL: Long, LONG time ago, back when the lair was
less then 4 months old, Tal, ( then called NOUROMANCER ) started telling
little stories about AB to his buddies. His buddies ( One M. Raider,
Shrub, Wizz of od, and 2 others ), shaired in his decietful tailes of
lust and slander, with our own AB as the 'porn' queen of all thies wild
orgies that we had at the Lair. The first one being User Meeting #1 (
the Sysop's Gathering ), then progressed into User Meeting #2 (
un-offically called The Users Strile out ).

During the course of UM #2, one un-luckie user dialed a 1-900 number,
and got into some serious toruble, but, you see, he was put up to it by
one of the 'buddies' ( see list above ).

As time progressed, so did the Lies, name calling, pranks, ect. Deals
were made and then broken, lied about, kinda like an 'all but
fist-fight' kinda of war. Hostitilies commed down when the warring
fractions decided to 'boy-cote' the other's bbs's. The end results: The
Lair and Final Frontier are the ONLY 2 out of the 5 BBS that still have
any trafic worth talking about. 2 of the 3 'coalition' bbs were
conficated by the FEDS, ( by reasons that I'm not at liberty to add for
a few more years ), leaving one very lonly bbs that handles the major
'ELETE' bbs. To this date, only nominal and civial telephone
conversation can be held, and there are still 3 persons having yet to
make retrubition for their wrong dooning, and there for, as sysop II, I
will make sure that until such retrubition, there names are dirty words,
and that their handles and personalities shall NOT be seen here, to help
protect our users from the un-lawful persuites thies children have.

Okay, did this make any head-way into explanining what is/was going on?

I take NOT credit for the traffic on this bbs. It's location and it's
set-up is what makes it a better bbs, not to add that there is only 3
commie bbs in the area left. 

  NOTE: NEBBS was commie
  Villa-straylight was commie
  Sages Hut was commie
  
  NEBBS > IBM = DIED
  SHRUB > --- = DIED
  V-SL  > conficated > IBM > networed
                     ( some name )
 there are 2 other bbs that were
 also commie, but are dead as a result
 of the combined efforts of the users
 that stand for the moral majority.

 Blag, all I'm doing here is clearing some stuff up, that's all. I take
credit for one thing, and one thing only, and that was the demise of one
BBS, and the facts behind this are still classified.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Now then. Derf seems to think that the world began the day his BBS was
set up. Thats his first mistake. His first error: I began calling myself
Tal Meta BEFORE "Fred Meeting 1", when I took down Tessier-Ashpool and
put up Villa Straylight "underground" so to speak. The second error is
in his dating of events. "Fred Meeting 1" took place several months
BEFORE Angel's Lair was put up. Next was the very critical fact that it
was not I who started telling stories about Angel Baby, it was several
dozen other people. he seems to have foregotten the fact that for
several months I had very strained relationships with the rest of my
friends simply because I DEFENDED Angel from such stories. The person
who made the "1-900" call was not then, nor was he ever any friend of
mine.(In fact that same user went on to have a sexual relationship with
his best friend's mother... He was, and remains today, a very sick
pup.).

Derf goes on to tell us that "2 of the 3 coalition bbs's were
confiscated". Bullshit. First off, there never was any "coalition".
Secondly, my BBS was the only one to get "confiscated", and if Derf
thinks he had anything to do with that, he's more deluded than even *I*
give him credit for being.

The actual claneder of events runs something like this:

Apr 90: The world first hears from Derf. 
May 90: User Meeting 1 (Fred Meeting #1) 
Jun 90: User Meeting 2 (The FIRST Derf Meeting - Angel Baby
        shows her face!)   
Jun 90: All my friends are on Angel's case, and I'm her sole defender.
Aug 90: I start seeing sides of Angel *I* don't care for. 
Sep 90: Angel's Lair is born! (Have they foregotten who PAID for their 
        DMBBS registration? It was me. Angel and I have a falling out
        shortly after. 
Nov 90: I stop calling Angel's Lair for numerous reasons not germaine
        to the subject at hand.
May 91: Villa Straylight (etc.) is confiscated by US Sprint & local cops. 
        Derf is noticably absent from these proceedings.

You can make your own decisions.
