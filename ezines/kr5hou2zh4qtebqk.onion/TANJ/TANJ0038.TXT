        It's 11:28 pm.
        The temperature is 54 degrees farenheit.
        The radio is playing Niel Young's version of "All Along the
                                                      Watchtower."
        The Parkway is clear.
        I'm on my way home.

        It's a good night to die.

She wasn't beautiful. No. She was still the greatest thing that ever
happened to me. I love....loved....love her. The kindest woman you could 
ever hope to meet, she was. A volunteer at a children's hospital. A 
thinker, too. I could talk with her. About anything. Anything....
philosophy, politics, music, dance.....love, us....the future. I used to 
lose myself just...staring...into those green eyes.

        The engine's whine almost drowns out the noise of the wind.

answered. I wish it hadn't been so. God, I wished. Only God knows that 
I have tried.

She always listened to the stereo when she took a bath. Claimed it relaxed
her. Always the same tape, too. "Cosmic Thing." B-52's.

It always annoyed me.

It was one of the things I loved about her.

I guess she slipped.

*-------------------------------------------------------------------------*

        Faster.
        Flames have spouted from the engine compartment.
        They lick around the edge of the hood.
        They begin to flow from the vent.

We only had the one bathroom. As it turned out, I was right outside the
door. I had been badgering her for ten minutes to let me in.
She kept saying no. She loved to do that to me. When the music stopped, I
figured she was on her way out. But she didn't come out. I called in to 
her, but there was no answer. After a few moments, I got worried. So I 
opened the door. When I saw the sparks, I knew.

The police who investigated ruled it an accident. "God's Will," they said.
They were extremely nice. Most of them couldn't meet my eye. Sergeant Gates
could. He offered to buy me a drink. Said he thought I could use one.

*-------------------------------------------------------------------------*
     BUT YOU AND I, WE'VE BEEN THROUGH THAT, AND THIS IS NOT OUR FATE,
*-------------------------------------------------------------------------*

        Faster.
        I am driving blind.
        Tha cabin has filled with smoke and flame.
        I think my eyes have been taken.
        My coat burns.

*-------------------------------------------------------------------------*
       "SO LET US NOT TALK FALSELY NOW, THE HOUR IS GETTING LATE."
*-------------------------------------------------------------------------*

"I don't know what ta say, Mal." 

"nothing you can say." 

"I feel like it's my fault, ya know?" 

"calm down, otis."
