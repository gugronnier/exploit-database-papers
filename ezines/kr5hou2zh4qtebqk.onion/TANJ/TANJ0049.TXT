                          - The Absence of Freedom -
                                  by Ulycees

        Why is there always such a false sense of freedom in this country?
And how does it actually start? Wow, those are pretty good questions. I 
wanna try to answer them, with my opinions of course.

        First, the "How did it start" thing. Think back to when you were
10 or 15 or so. What was life all about? Lesse, mom throws you on a bus,
the bus brings you to school, you learn about "Life", they throw you back
on the bus, you go home and go out and play. Simple enough. Everything is
pretty much dictated and nothing actually changes day to day.

        All of a sudden, one day you find yourself alone. I don't mean 
alone as in "No one around". I mean alone as in "Wow.. Im somewhere, and 
my parents aren't here!". Sometime in life, your parents actually let you
go out and have fun while they sit home on the couch thinking about how you
are being abducted at that very moment (Or wishing it upon you. Hey, your
childhood is not my problem).. But anyway, there you are. You can go where
you want (As long as your legs can bike it that far). You live for the new
found freedom and soon you crave some more. Conversations start to sound like
this:

You: Mom, Can I go to K-mart with John. We are riding bikes there..
Mom: No, its to far.
You: Oh, Ok.. Can I go to Johns' then?
Mom: Sure. Be home by dinner.
You: Bye!
Friend 1: So, are you allowed to go?
You: No, but I don't have to be home until dinner. Lets go to K-Mart.

        This conversation took place many times with me. But, for some 
strange reason, I had a bad perception of time, and I never noticed when it
was actually getting dark out. So, I always got caught when my mom decided
to do the rounds of the neighborhood searching for me. 

        By the time you turn 16, things start to get a little easier. Some
of your friends start to drive, so you can hang out with them and go where 
you want. The conversations still look the same though:

You: Hey Mom, Im goin to Ocean County Mall with a few people. I'll be back
     later.
Mom: No your not. I dont want you on the parkway with new drivers.
You: What?! Pfft. Fine, Im goin out to play football then.
Mom: Ok, be home by 10. You have school tommorow.
<Slam>
Friend 1: Whats up?
You: She said no, fuck her, lets bolt..
Friend 1: Cool..

        And so, more freedom. Then, you get your license. When this happens,
I think parents start to think "Well, he's out of our hands now, he can do
what he wants". And once you are out all alone with no one to bother you, you
start to annoy that thing called society. Lying to your parents worked pretty
well eh'? How does it work on the local law enforcement?

You: Uhhh.. Drinking? Ummm.. No.. I was going home now actually..
Cop: Really? Barnegat is South boy.. Why are you heading North?
You: Err.. 
Cop: Wanna step out of the car and let me have a look around?

        Hey! Thats illegal! You know your rights! You took Buisness Law in
your first year of High School! Go get him Genius!!

You: Actually Sir, that's illegal, you have no probable cause, and you 
     have not even told me why I was pulled over.
Cop: Heh (Walks away)
You: (Feel great)
Cop: (Comes Back and opens your door) You have the right to remain silent..
You: Huh?
Cop: (Pulls you out of car and starts to search you) Anything you say, can
     and will, believe me, be used against you in a court of law.

        After cooling off in the back of a State Troopers car for an hour,
     you decide that a more sensible appoach should be used. 

You: Excuse me.. Hi! Umm, can you put my seat back? I swear there is nothing
     under it.. Can we talk for a second? There seem to be a mistake.
Cop: What mistake?
You: Well, I didn't actually do anything wrong, I mean..
Cop: You nervous?
You: Well.. No I mean..
Cop: You sound nervous.. You hiding something?
You: Err.. No, not I. Wait..
(Cops then go back to see what neat thing you can hide in the paneling of
 your door)

        After 2 hours of searching, the Police send 3 lint balls, and some
Moss that grew under your seat in to the lab to be analized. You will be
notified at a later date as to when your court case will be held for 
resisting arrest. 

        How do you explain this to your parents? Well, you don't. Well, not
actually.. You just can't. 

Mom and Dad: What did you do?
You: Nothing
Them: Nothing? You HAD to do something.
You: I swear. I was just driving along and they pulled me over
Them: Your grounded. We dont tolerate liars.

        That sounds like a pretty rough expierence. Especially for someone
that was only a driver for about 1 1/2 months. Adults usually grin and bear
a situation like this. I mean, they are the Police, they are God, who goes
against God?

But, in the Teenage mind, there is another thought process...

You: Fuck that Dude.. Someones paying...

        And there you are on your life of "Fuck Da Police". no one is on your
side. Everyone is out to get you. Police become evil, leaders become puppets
and you basically get fed up with everyones standards. So, you start to
create your own. A little phone phreaking never hurt anyone right? Whos going
to miss this candy bar, no one will notice its gone. Or better yet, Hey, I 
just found me a new Sound Blaster Pro! 

        What Im trying to say is. Something starts the chain. And know what 
that something is? It's society. It's always there trying to knock you down
and make you admit "Fine.. You are the way.. I will follow.. I give up...
I am to ignorant to run my own life... Take me... Mold me.. I want to be a 
number..."  Hey wait.. You already have a number.. Something like this:
XXX-XX-XXXX.. They moniter how much you make that way too.. heh..

        Now, Im not trying to tell you what you should do and what you 
should not do. Lord knows, no one could ever tell me... But just a piece of
advice.. Look, Listen and Learn.. If you don't know whats going on around 
you.. You might as well start signing your life over now.

        As for the other question of "Why there is a false sense of Freedom".
Well, I actually don't know why... Can someone please tell me?
