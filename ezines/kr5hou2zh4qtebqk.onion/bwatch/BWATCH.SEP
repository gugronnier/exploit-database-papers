 DO CATTLE DREAM AND CAN PIGS FLY?
 ---------------------------------       

We hear from BBS operators. I suppose it's natural and pretty much to be 
expected. It's not so much that we hear from BBS operators, as it is WHAT we 
hear from BBS operators. Accustomed to operating bulletin boards for 
similarly intrigued technoids, for years they yearned for wider recognition 
and wider participation from normal people. This year, they got it. And the 
translation from small community of PC enthusiasts to the wider world has 
some problems.

Three operators have called in the past week with fear in their voices and 
trouble in their hearts. One had his BBS hauled off by the local police. Two 
were facing TV crews, one on a local news station and one on the nationally 
syndicated Donahue talk show. The shows were all ready written and scripted 
SEX ONLINE. The BBS operators were simply asked to wear shirts with bull's 
eyes on them and stand in front of the camera.

The online world is analogous to the real world in many ways and it does 
reflect it. But it isn't the real world. In many, many respects, it is a 
fantasy. We are all equal. None of us have handicaps. None of us are old. 
None of us are ugly. There are no fat people online. No short people. Nobody 
stutters. Nobody wets their pants. There is no pain. There is no crime. We 
are all safe. We all have good intentions. We can all pseudo-travel around 
the continent or world for pennies. We can fall in love and never have to 
wake up, chew our arm off at the shoulder, and slip quietly out into the 
dawn. Or even deal with morning breath. Rub a lamp.

It does take a certain level of imagination to play. And frankly, a good 
percentage of the real world population can barely get dressed and get to 
work after a lifetime of practice. Fortunately, for most of them, the modems 
and technology are all still too much to tackle. And a tremendous number of 
people are just living for the moment when they can be offended about 
something or another. We hear from THEM occasionally as well. If I could 
grant them the gift of the other twelve IQ points they would need to be able 
to bark like a dog, I would give it to them freely, but it just isn't 
something you can do.

And the thin lightless line where CyberSpace meets the parking lot distorts 
reality in both directions. If you print out a log of CyberSpace, and read it 
on clean white paper, it appears to be things that it is not. Likewise, if 
you carry too much of the parking lot online, you're going to be a bit 
confused. Pigs can fly online, but pigs still can't fly.

I know that this is the editorial where I should note that I "told you so" 
last November and that you really have to clean up these GIF images of 
slobbering overweight babes of the night to save your systems. And in a 
practical sense, I suppose you do. They really aren't center stage in all of 
this anyway. But it would help if I could look into the eyes of the cattle, 
and see some sense of awareness of what they are doing, and what the price 
really is as they "crack down" on the online community. Will it in fact stop 
with "obscenity?" IS that all that they are after?

Had we really insisted that the airline industry obey all existing automobile 
traffic laws, we might still have an airline industry, but it would work very 
differently. It might make perfect sense. It might be perfectly legal. And it 
might even work. But it would result in some very slow, low flying aircraft 
with a technologically very hard won built in ability to stop at each traffic 
light, and I'm not sure that is a good thing in the long run. The price paid 
is hard to gauge - particularly if you're waiting on the Presidential haircut 
so you can take off. But there would be a price.

For the media, the sex online story is about the only handle they've been 
able to get on it so far. You can't have thirteen million people doing 
something obsessively that almost no one was doing a few years back and not 
cover it. And this is the easy story. Children can access blurry images of 
sex by simply taking a computer, a modem, a terminal program, a telephone 
line, blending them all together to log onto a service, convince the BBS 
operator they are 21 years old, and paw through 9 GB of files to find a 
hundred or so slimy ones, download them, and try to get their VGA card driver 
working right with a GIF image viewing program. It's simple. Actually, they 
are being SUBJECTED to this. I don't know about you, but I'm glad I was 
raised in an age where a boy only had to worry about hiding it under his bed 
carefully. ALL the rationalizations for this witch hunt are just too strained 
- too contrived, to be real. Yeah, some of the images are disgusting. So are 
some TV commercials.

But what's next? What if someone commits a crime somewhere, AND was online at 
some time? We really need to be able to identify these people, don't we? It 
ALWAYS starts with the most extreme cases, and migrates to 4-line BBSs with 
shareware CD-ROMs. If you give an inch, they'll take all of it. And if Mr. 
Koresh is any example, they want their inch real badly.

The online community is the ONLY medium where everyone can be heard. Not just 
those who own large publishing conglomerates, and not those who own 
television and radio stations. Freedom of speech in the past has been easy - 
anyone was allowed to speak their mind (within certain restrictions) because 
we could be assured only a handful could hear them. The online technologies 
have the potential to assure, for the very first time,  that anyone's voice 
can span a continent. It may serve as the first REAL test of what our 
commitment to free speech is - or isn't.  How badly, as a society, do we WANT 
people to be able to speak freely in a forum that might just be effective?  
And what price are we willing to pay to allow that, or perhaps to secure it?  
A big contingent of the herd is very restless at the uneasy thought of no 
intellectual fences.  For those able - think about it....

 =====================
 LETTERS TO THE EDITOR
 =====================

 Dear Mr. Rickard:

Please find enclosed my check for $59 for a two year subscription to 
"Boardwatch".  I enjoy the brashness of your prose although I do not always 
agree with your outspoken opinions.  However, the letters alone are, 
debatably, worth the price of admission.

In your June issue you recount your experience of reading "Byte" magazine for 
15 consecutive years to achieve a certain level of subject understanding and 
seem to advise a reader to follow "Boardwatch" for a similar period to 
achieve a similar understanding of your subject matter.  Although I have 
little doubt that "Boardwatch" will survive that period, as a 71 year old 
retiree I am not at all sure that I will.  (Are subscriptions assignable?)

With that thought in mind I would like to find a path to substantially 
expedite the learning process.  Some six years ago I was quite active (at 
least as a visitor) in the BBS world.  Upon coming to Mexico and TelMex I 
gave up due to an apparent attitude on the part of TelMex that each caller 
should be given the opportunity to finance the entire TelMex network 
improvement program.  Since a great deal has happened in the last six years I 
find that I am unfamiliar with current configurations, capabilities, etc.  
However, I have acquired a Gateway 2000 (386 DX) and installed an internal 
Gateway Telepath modem - V.32bis, V.32, V.22, V.22bis, V.21, V.42, V.42bis, 
FAX mode Group 3, etc. using Qmodem, X-Talk and WinFax an all that stuff 
operating at some near supersonic speed that should reduce TelMex's take to a 
few wrinkled pesos!  With some difficulties (a broken blade on my favorite 
skinnin' knife), this system is now installed and working, by cracky!!

Neaow thin!!! Are there any publications that provide a description of the 
nets, how they tie together, how you find addresses, how you send messages, 
what all this costs, etc. etc?  A few years ago I purchased a Compuserve 
"Starter Kit" and spent several hours wandering through an endless succession 
of menus like a deer lost in the woods, until I was forced to abandon the 
project just short of turning over my entire pension to TelMex.  This is not, 
from here, a viable route. It appears desirable to seek more "book larnin" 
prior to again connecting up to the TelMex Corporate Treasury.

I might point out that if you were to publish such an article(s) one time, 
the future demand could be filled by reprints and or addenda (and someday you 
could publish a book and retire), all at great profit to "Boardwatch" and 
J.R. (i.e. you too, could move to Mexico and live off my pension!!)

If you don't have time right now - never mind, but send the subscription 
anyway.

Hoping for your early attention to this matter, I am

 Sincerely,
 El Gringo Viejo
 R.M Titus
 Jalisco, Mexico

 Mr. Titus:

I checked with TelMex (the telephone company in Mexico) on your behalf.  They 
inform me they do in fact want the entire pension, and ask that you please 
send it in soonest.  Apparently there have been some momentary delays between 
when you receive your check, and when you pass it on to them.  They sounded 
genuinely concerned, and asked that I pass on their wishes for your continued 
good health for many years to come.

My reference to Byte was perhaps unclear.  It did not require 15 years to 
"achieve a certain level of subject understanding" through reading Byte - 
certainly less than a year in fact.  But had Byte focused on the novice 
information I originally needed, it would not have been useful once I passed 
that novice stage.  I would have outgrown it before the first renewal period.  
It has held my ATTENTION for a full 15 years after I learned the basics - 
which took a few months and a bit of effort on my part.

And it did so by following the industry with pernicious attention to detail 
and a knowledgeable view of what was going on, through MANY cycles of new 
hardware, new software, new techniques, and so forth.  Because of this 
experience, we at Boardwatch early on adopted a rather militant stance 
against "talking down" to the reader and against seeking least common 
denominator status. Certainly this limits our growth, our financial 
prospects, and our subscriber base. But it makes it an interesting magazine 
for us to produce, and for those who do follow the industry to read.  So let 
Bill Ziff retire to Mexico.  I'm busy.

But the larger issue you raise is the definitive or all encompassing article 
or book that will "make you smart" on this technology and the labyrinth of 
online services.  Were it available, I assure you I most certainly  would not 
have personally written it, because I would be off doing something else.  
Compediums and definitive works are always done AFTER the final brick is 
laid, the final wire strung, the final rail has been nailed into place. They 
tend to be historical in nature - mapping how it WAS done.

Boardwatch covers an infant industry, just emerging from the minds of men and 
women hellbent over the kitchen table, for reasons good or ill, on changing 
the way people communicate - with computers.  It is technical in a lot of 
places, but actually goes quite beyond that - to change the span and reach of 
the individual - to the point where we can all live in Mexico or anywhere 
else and still have an impact anywhere on the planet we wish.

Boardwatch's role is to try to pick out the pieces we think matter AS THEY 
DEVELOP and as they are pioneered, and report on them to a readership we 
assume absolutely to be gentlemen and scholars all - and many of which we 
happen to know are a lot smarter than we are. If anyone wants to act like a 
gentleman and scholar, and try to GET smarter than THEY are, they're welcome 
to join us on the journey.  But it is a journey.  And when it evolves to 
become a destination, I'll be long gone.

In the evolution of these technologies, it is my fondest hope that one day we 
can all tell monolithic monopolistic entities such as your telephone company 
- to go to Tel.

 Hi Jack!

The August 1993 Boardwatch was the second one I've picked up recently. I'm 
fascinated by both the technology and the social aspects of computer 
networking. If this keeps up I might have to subscribe! But, what is this 
problem you have with UNIX? Your bashing of the "UNIX community" in the 
editor's notes, while amusing, was in stark contrast to the well-informed, 
open-minded way you seem to deal with other topics. I would say that the 
"UNIX community" and the "BBS community" have a lot in common. For instance, 
some (not all) members of each community are so immersed in "their" jargon, 
shared assumptions, and technology that they can't imagine how off-putting it 
can be to the outsider. Both are religions in a way. Ironically, the UNIX 
"religion" started as a rebellion against the overly complex, user-hostile 
mainframe operating systems that dominated at the time.

Let's try an experiment. I'll take a short passage from your editorial and 
replace "UNIX" with "BBS". Ready? "The interface to BBS isn't an interface at 
all. It's a test. And BBS aficionados actually perceive that the world should 
in fact learn BBS and pass the test." I have dialed up BBS systems that gave 
me this exact feeling. If it had been a UNIX shell interface instead, I would 
have had a much easier time of it. But I realize that this is not because one 
interface is good and the other bad u it is because one is familiar to me and 
one is not. Nor do I assume that nobody in the BBS community knows or cares 
about providing a suitable user interface for the uninitiated. I just assumed 
that that particular sysop had other priorities.

 Paul:

I don't quite buy your plug and play exercise with terms.  I write very 
little by accident - it's hard enough to do it on purpose.  The UNIX mantra 
does exceed the normal jargon/love of the familiar that IS quite pervasive 
throughout technology.  THAT WAS in fact the point.  That said, I don't 
really have any problem with UNIX other than I don't buy the party line on 
what it can and can't do. That does tend to irritate the more devout UNIX 
apoligists, but there you have it. I do think much of what drives the 
Internet and an increasingly "connected" world has come out of this UNIX 
community.  Some of my best friends are devoted to UNIXology.

 Jack,

I have just finished reading the August 1993 issue of Boardwatch magazine and 
I would like to thank you for providing such a good magazine.

I have just recently re-discovered the online world having been away from it 
for about five years.  A few months ago I bought a new 486dx33 with a good 
modem and hit the boards here in Houston , Texas.  I also hit the news stands 
in search of a magazine that would guide me through the muck of online 
services.  I spent a lot of money before finding Boardwatch and I now have 
ended my search for a satisfying online service and a good magazine.

The online service I have found is Delphi.  The Internet gateway is the most 
amazing thing I have ever come across.  It is what I used to dream about when 
I was twelve and calling the local c-64/Atari boards.  I really connected to 
your "We look for things" motto that you mentioned in the 8/93 issue.  I have 
the same excited feeling when I read your magazine - like I have found a 
whole new world that is growing larger and more exciting every day.

I would also like to comment on the article describing how to take advantage 
of Genie's new rate schedule.  I think it is great that you can spend just a 
few minutes a day actually online and still get a lot done. It sounds very 
boring though.  Who wants to get on a system and not look around a little 
bit?  Maybe do some chatting or just read a few news articles.

I just cancelled my Prodigy account after finding Delphi and I feel 
liberated. The cost is less and I am connected to the entire world, not just 
an electronic island.

Again I would like to thank you for the excellent publication.  There are a 
lot of "bubble-gum" magazines out there describing the online world and it is 
nice to find a meat and potatoes guide that does not take it to the 
Mondo-2000 extremes.  Not that I don't like to get extreme.

 Take care,
 Steven Baker

 Steve:

Personally, I share your spirit of exploration.  I do like to browse about.  
But it is an experience in travel, and part of what makes the online world so 
fascinating is its many levels and layers.  One of those is simply using 
e-mail and participating in a few conferences.  And many find it much less 
expensive, and less of a press of time, to do it on their own machine, on 
their own desktop, at their own leisure.  I'm pretty onboard with that 
concept frankly, and ultimately, I think e-mail wants to be very personally 
nailed to the individuals desktop, and the delivery details firmly uploaded 
to be someone else's problem.  This drives the popularity of offline mail 
readers, utilities such as Alladin, OZCIS, TAPCIS, and others to tap into 
commercial online services, and increasingly, Windows and Mac programs to 
make the Internet connection.  Many callers automate this to such a degree, 
they couldn't tell you when their machine actually made the call to do mail.  
They still have all the tools to go on a walkabout online, but they can 
handle their personal e-mail and keep track of a few dozen discussions of 
continued interest without even being in the room when the magic digits are 
dialed.

 Jack:

Here in Downriver Detroit there is a project called "The Cynedd Project" 
dedicated to pairing up homebound (sick, handicapped, injured) children and 
used computer systems.  The goal is to have these isolated children 
communicate with "key-pals" from all over via the Internet and Native 
American Network.  Although we only have 2 children active right now...as 
soon as the next complete system has been put together, the next child will 
be found through children's hospitals, schools, and other agencies.  Computer 
clubs and BBS members have been actively working on this since May of this 
year.

Another real need came to light while we were working on this.  There are no 
BBSes in our area, that cater to young children.  Many of the Sysops have 
young children, many of my BBS friends have small children, but there is no 
place attractive to the under ten year old child.

I wonder if you have ever heard of a board so dedicated.  If so I would 
appreciate knowing the number so I can explore and research it (or them) and 
talk with the persons involved.  I can't believe that it hasn't been tried, 
but I have not been able locate anyone who has ever heard of a Kiddie Board.

 Laura Bashlor
 lauralou@gatecom.com

 Laura:

I've heard vague rumors of Barbinets and BBS's for tots over the years, but 
frankly, few come to mind at the moment.  One that does that I've always been 
a bit intrigued with is Noel Stookey's CELEBRATION STATION in Blue Hill Falls 
Maine. (207)374-5161.  Noel is "Peter" in "Peter, Paul and Mary", a folk song 
group among whose credits are "Puff the Magic Dragon."  Noel is apparently 
quite taken with children and started his BBS specifically for children.

Perhaps some of our readers can forward information on BBSs specifically for 
children in response to your letter.  Somebody has got to be doing a list on 
this.

 Hi Jack,

Having been an avid reader of Boardwatch for over a year now, (and a 
subscriber via a friend in the US) I have been meaning to get down and write 
a short note to you to tell you that BBSing is alive and well on the Southern  
tip of Africa!  I also wanted to say that Boardwatch is an absolutely 
invaluable publication for anyone even remotely connected to BBS's. It might 
be the smallest of the 5 mags I read each month, but it is the one I read 
from cover to cover!

I've been a BBS user for a few years and an online addict for as long! I also 
publish a unique BBS listing covering South  Africa, on a monthly basis. As 
far as I know it's one of it's kind,  in that it creates the dialing 
directories for a few of the most popular comms programs based on the users 
selection criteria. RFYYMM.ZIP.

Back to the South African BBS scene and a few stats as at end June 93.

Number of active BBS's - 157

Active being the operative word!  I don't know what it's like overseas but 
BBS's open and close at a rate of knots!

 Mail Networks
 FidoNet - 75
 RsaNET - 20
 Link - 11

BBS Software split

 Remote Access - 89
 PCBoard - 34
 Maximus - 8
 Wildcat - 5
 UltraBBS - 5
 Other - 16

What's interesting here is when one converts the number of boards to the 
number of nodes, the Remote Access dominance is less apparent.

 Remote Access = 95 Nodes
 PCBoard = 67 nodes.

Plus of course if we were able to ascertain the registered software stats,  
PCBoard would win hands down, as all of them are registered.

Most of the big boards (and in South Africa anything over 5 nodes is 
considered big) run PCBoard. In fact all the big boards bar one which runs 
MajorBBS run it. If you publish my letter I will expect a rush of abuse from 
the RA boys that I get from time to time when I show my bias towards PCBoard. 
;-)

 Mail packet split
 QWK Packet - 105 nodes
 Bluewave - 56 nodes

Although the QWK format is dominant at the moment, unless Sparky spends 
another half an hour to dream up QWK II, I can see the limitations of the QWK 
packet causing more and more boards to switch to BlueWave.  I understand that 
a release of Bluewave for PCBoard is eminent and that could very well change 
the stats.

 Modem Split (Nodes)
 USRobotics HST - 65
 2400 and MNP5 - 63
 V.32bis - 55
 V.32 - 19
 Speedmodems - 7
 ZyXel - 6

The modem stats have changed dramatically in the last year with the advent of  
the cheaper V.32 and V.32bis modems making their appearance. The HST price  
reductions also helped !  ;-) Although the ZyXel modem is only just making 
it's appearance in South Africa I think it's going to have a much bigger 
market share within the next year.

BTW I'm not a Sysop.... with having to dial each BBS in my list each month to 
verify that they still exist, and an active echomailer as well, I don't have 
the time, money or the inclination to run a board ! ;-)

Talking about money...  some of the boards in S.A. are at last starting to 
make a small profit or at least covering costs. We have a relatively small 
modem population in South Africa, and it's unlikely that a BBS's income could 
support a Sysop for some time to come.  Trying to get publicity for BBS's 
here is a major task.  Of course the only stuff they consider newsworthy is 
the occasional porn board that gets busted and the never ending garbage that 
is spewn out about viruses.

We do however get some indirect publicity though the advertising of the 
government Prestel System called Beltel. At least it gets people to buy a 
modem!  Once they have the modem they may be lucky enough to find out about a 
BBS and then they download my list and we hook another addict!

Compuserve has also arrived in South Africa via Compuserve Africa.  
Unfortunately it's just too expensive for the man in the street, as apart 
from the normal Compuserve charges that we would incur at our horrendous 
exchange rate, there is an addition cost for the high speed line from 
Pretoria to Compuserve that we have to pay for.  :-( But it again highlights 
the use of modems.

Once again,  many thanks for a great magazine Jack.  We'll be  thinking about  
you all having fun at ONE BBSCON and maybe I'll rob a bank next year so that 
I can join you! ;-)

 Rob:

Well, we did publish it, and I fear you can expect your dose of grief from 
the "RA boys."  Thank you so much for the update from South Africa.  It is 
indeed fascinating and it sounds like bulletin boards are booming there as 
well.  It is striking that the online model has emerged so universally 
similar, from country to country and continent to continent, with bulletin 
boards thriving on the edge of the expense of commercial services, the 
arrogance of government programs, the popularity of networked mail, and so 
forth.

Similarly, the level of things shared in common among people connected by 
wire globally is a little charming.  I think governments dependent on selling 
the concept of the Mongol Hordes gathering just over the horizon in order to 
motivate/manipulate their own populations is going to become a bit harder 
sell as the result of all this.

 Mr. Rickard:

First off, what a tremendous resource BOARDWATCH Magazine has been. Before 
reading BOARDWATCH I was a puny 97lb. network surfer. Now, after months of 
the BOARDWATCH program I am a muscular, lean, mean e-mailing machine!

Seriously, I am trying to establish contacts with AFS students that have 
attended my school. For whatever reasons, regular mail is very inconsistent 
in going to or coming from Russia.

In recent issues there have been letters from a Gentleman from St. 
Petersburg, coincidentally, where two of the students live. I have misplaced 
the issues with his letters and e-mail address. Can you send me his e-mail 
address?

My purpose in contacting him would be to see if there is a way to open up 
communications between the AFS students and their parents, and between me and 
the AFS students who have just returned to their homes in St. Petersburg. 
Additionally I am hopeful that a network of some sort can be developed that 
would facilitate communication between AFS'ers and their host families, and 
aregular' families. This would not be limited to just Russia as, at least 
here, we have AFS students from Turkey and Brazil.

Thanks in advance for your consideration of these comments.

have happened during a download or something.

It was in fact our May, 1993 issue where we carried a report from Arcady 
Khotin (agh@nwpc.spb.su) bringing us up to date on the state of networking in 
the Soviet Union. I'm sure he'd be pleased to hear from you.  You might 
remind him to update us while you're at it.

 Dear Boardwatch Mag,

I am a big fan of your Magazine, and the area I find most interesting is your 
section on BBS laws, Legally Online.  I often use it as a source on my BBS 
for policy and to aid other SysOps in my area.

My Board, Friendly Fire (Will go public in August after ONEBBS CON) is a 
political debate board and a source for BBS law, Political Speeches, and 
other topics of political and BBS interest.

I used the policy published in the July version of your Magazine that was 
from Exec-PC on the topic of adult gifs to write a policy for this area on 
GIFS.  My question is, would this be a copyright infringement of your 
magazine or of Exec-PC?  I rewrote it in afriendly' language, and gave you 
and Exec-PC as a source, but I thought the prudent thing to do would be to 
check with you.

Thanks for a great Mag,

 M Wayne Stefiel,  Friendly Fire BBS

 Wayne:

We would probably consider it a copyright infringement, however friendly.  
But you should really check with the author, Greg Ryan, at EXEC-PC.  His 
wishes are our wishes with regards to this specific article.

Political debate is warp and woof in the web of online life.  You should do 
well.  Since this issue will be our "ONE BBSCON Special Edition" such as it 
is, welcome to the convention.

Your June issue was my first.  I found it to be an invaluable resource.

I'll probably be suffering from information overload when the next issue 
comes out!  I'm a contractor assistant to a sysop on an Environmental 
Protection Agency BBS.  Your magazine has already given me lots of 
information, ideas, and contacts.  However I was distressed that our board, 
The Office of Air Quality Planning and Standards Technology Transfer Network, 
wasn't included in your list of government BBS's. The TTN is a 64 line TBBS 
based system which contains fourteen individual BBS's covering topics from 
the Clean Air Act Amendments to Ambient Air Monitoring (the Ambient 
Monitoring Technical Information Center - AMTIC - is the BBS I am personally 
working on, with Joe Elkins as the EPA sysop).  The TTN receives an average 
of eight thousand calls a month, and I would like to think we are one of the 
foremost on-line sources of information in the air pollution field. Give us a 
call at (919)541-5742 (8-N-1)!

Thanks Again for the Great Magazine!

 Hi, Jack,

Like a lot of letters I'm sure you receive, this one is more of a stream of 
consciousness than an organized missive of thoughts.  But I have a couple of 
things to comment on -

In a recent issue, you were attempting to come up with some numbers of just 
how many modem-equipped computers there were.  You went through a list of how 
many microprocessors Intel sold of various types over the years, and then 
casually wrote off a few million people by saying "let's assume all the PC's 
and XT's (8088/6's) are out of commission" or something of the sort.

Nope!  In fact, I'm using an XT clone to write this very mail to you. I don't 
know how many XT clones are still operating, but it's a safe bet that more of 
them are telecommunicating than just about any other application short of 
word processing.  Most 8-10 MHz and above XTs can run fine even at 9600 baud, 
and it doesn't take a lot of horsepower to emulate a dumb terminal.

Heck, even the three online services that either require or push a front-end 
program can run on XTs.  CompuServe Information Manager's DOS version (as far 
as I know), America Online's PC/AOL 1.5a (GeoWorks-based) and Prodigy's PC 
software all run just fine on XTs and clones.  For the XTs that can't run 
PC/AOL due to only having CGA graphics and no hard drive, AOL offers its 
PC-Link front-end software.

No, I'm not gonna be one of those screamers that demand coverage of old-style 
computers.  I know I'm on a relic, and don't expect the kind of attention 
that 386/486/Pentium/etc. users get these days...and I don't even want it.  
But telecomputing is one of the few pursuits in the computing world that 
doesn't require a power machine like a 486/66, and probably one of the few 
applications that an XT is good for in 1993.

If someone reading your magazine can pick up a used XT clone for a couple of 
hundred bucks or less, and they use it to get on a BBS, an online service or 
the Internet, and get enjoyment out of it... well, then I consider it a good 
service you've done.  And maybe they will have an appetite whetted to move up 
to something "meatier", like the aforementioned 486 "power machine", if they 
like what they see.

 Mike Ward
 parth2@aol.com

 Mike:

I don't think there is a thing in the world wrong with putting old hardware 
into play for communications.  As you point out, even at 14.4 kbps, it is 
really overkill. If you can get an XT fitted up with a pretty good VGA 
monitor and a serial port with NS16550 UARTs to handle the speed, they work 
fabulously.  Save the big iron for Mandelbrot Fractals.

I wasn't actually trying to denigrate old hardware at all.  We try to come up 
with all sorts of numbers here at Boardwatch.  It's a constant area of 
interest both for us and our readership.  One of the reasons for this, 
unfortunately, is that there are a LOT of people out there generating 
numbers, and they tend to be unerringly bogus.  Much of it goes beyond even 
the usual industry hype.  I guess if you are going to generate some, it 
doesn't seem like you've done much unless they are "big" numbers.  And 
unfortunately, that renders them more or less useless.

We tend to be conservative with our number generator.  We generally throw out 
perfectly good chunks to intentionally err on the conservative side when in 
doubt.  Faced with the task of estimating how many XT's are still in useful 
operation, as opposed to acting as land fill, closet fodder, or desktop 
ornamentation, we failed to produce a methodology.  So we axed XT's as a 
tradeoff for keeping ALL AT class machines, many of which ALSO have been a 
long time between drinks from the wall socket.  We are assuming the higher 
investment in dollars in a386 and a486 iron keeps them in the "active" 
column.

 Dear Jack,

In reading your June `93 issue, you make an humorous (I believe) comment  on
the bottom of pg 14 about connecting to a vending machine in Omaha. In
reading the nets, not too long ago I came across some posts by various
University folks who had their pop machines wired into their university
network, which *anyone* with an Internet IP connection could query to see how
many cans of pop were left inside.

How true this actually is I'm not sure. But it's a scary thought that people
around the world could find out how much pop I have left in my vending
machine. :)

Yours is a good magazine. Keep up the good work!

 Tim Kuehn
 timk@tdkcs.waterloo.on.ca

 Tim:

I saw some similar references.  I found them a bit believable.  Some of these
Internet heads actually DO things like that.  They had a bread toaster wired
up to ethernet at an INTEROP a few years ago.

I don't think it poses much of a threat to our personal pop privacy myself.
But if it is a matter of concern, you might consider developing a pop machine
security software package to see if there is a market for it.  Who knows,
there may ultimately be a global network of pop machines where industry
executives can find out REALLY what brands are selling NOW.

 Dear Jack,

I've recently received my third issue of Boardwatch and am very pleased with 
your publication.  In fact, Boardwatch has opened up the world to me via 
modem.  Thanks to Boardwatch, I'm a PC Pursuit subscriber and have become a 
member of over 30 boards around the country, at last count.  I never cease to 
be amazed at the diversity of BBS configurations, graphics, commands, themes, 
and SYSOP attitudes and mentality.  In my explorations, I've seen everything 
from "WELCOME!  This is the BBS, I'm the SYSOP, enjoy!" to "Government 
officials, law enforcement officers and evangelists not welcome here" (and 
other, more "colorful" greetings which I dare not repeat).  I still get a bit 
excited when I see the "CONNECT" message on my monitor.

There are two articles in your July issue which I felt were outstanding.  
"Dealing With Adult .GIF Images" by Greg Ryan contains good, sound advice and 
it is nice to see someone taking the lead in developing some uniform 
standards for SYSOPS in this area.  Also, "Steve Jackson Games v. US Secret 
Service" by Peter D. Kennedy.  After reading the outrageously fanatical 
rantings by others about this case and the issues involved, Mr. Kennedy's 
article was a breath of fresh air.  A regular column written by Mr. Kennedy 
would be most appreciated by this subscriber.

Keep up the good work, I'll be looking forward to receiving my next issue of 
Boardwatch.

 Sincerely,
 Dave Tracy
 71573.3105@compuserve.com

 Dave:

Pleased to hear we are hitting the mark. Many times when topics grow beyond 
the bounds of normal hysteria, we've found it a good exercise to go back to 
the heart of the heat.  I actually disagree most broadly with most of what 
Mr. Ryan wrote, but thought it would be a valuable exercise to publish the 
thoughts of someone that has to LIVE with this issue in a big way and every 
day. He expressed their strategy at EXEC-PC quite succinctly, and I think to 
the benefit of the community.

Similarly, Mr. Kennedy was the lawyer who actually represented Steve Jackson 
in the case.  He was actually my second choice for this piece.  But when the 
judge in the case turned me down cold, Kennedy had to do. He did do a good 
job of it all the way through I thought.  And who knows, the judge might have 
had a dyslexia problem.

 Dear Mr. Rickard,

Sorry, but calling you "Jack" seems horribly presumptuous given that we have 
no actual acquaintance.

Your column in the August issue of Boardwatch, and the prolix comments of Ben 
Blumenberg criticizing education and the current crop of students have 
incited me to write, and the wonderful historical and literary scope of your 
comments in Boardwatch give me hope that you may find the following thoughts 
at least mildly amusing.

While the comments to the effect that much of the message base in the 
electronic community is garbage are true, the blame for the causes of that 
wasteland may be applied with a brush that is a little on the broad side.  
Remember that all of us currently using the electronic medium received 
essentially the same education, and that that education contained little or 
nothing relevant to using Email, yet we are quite capable of accomplishing 
what we wish within that medium.  A fair conclusion one may draw from that 
evidence, then, is that formal education serves, as it always has, as a means 
of acquisition of the vocabulary of dealing with the world and of the 
excitement of learning.  The public schools can and do accomplish this task 
quite well among those willing to listen to the teachers.

While the NEA is undeniably touting messages that a good many of us would 
rather not hear, having been married to a teacher for twenty years, I can 
assure you that the NEA does NOT speak for all teachers.  In fact it may not 
speak even for the majority of them.  Many of the defects in public education 
today are not the fault of the schools, but of the parents of the students in 
them.  Many parents do not care to spend the time to read to their kids when 
the kids are little so that they enter school with a love of reading, or to 
help their kids learn manners so that they can interact well with others in 
school, or to help them explore all the exciting minutiae of the world around 
them so that they will learn the excitement of discovery.  Having thus 
abandoned their responsibilities as parents, they demand that the schools 
adopt an ever greater role as the parents' surrogate while also demanding 
that the schools perform these additional tasks without any more tax revenue 
and in a politically correct manner; all while not interfering with their 
children's' "space"!  Having failed either to discipline their children or to 
teach them self-discipline (and I speak from the experience of listening to 
teachers' "war stories" here), parents become outraged at both teachers' 
attempts to apply the discipline necessary to provide an environment for 
learning and any lack of such attempts they perceive.

The public media constantly poke fun at learning:  "sitcoms" portray anyone 
who has any education as a nerd, knowledge of mathematics or the ability to 
use English effectively means you are a geek, and knowledge has no intrinsic 
or extrinsic value.  As we raise the current generation of "vidiots", we can 
hardly blame the schools for failing to exert enough influence to overcome 
the message in which we all swim daily that one can not display an interest 
in any subject other than sex or football without screaming to the world "I 
am a dork" by doing so.

Our society considers money to be the ultimate reward for displaying the 
characteristics the society values most, so let's take a look at who makes 
the most money, and by implication, who displays the most value to our 
society. So, who tops the list?   Actors, rock musicians, and sports figures 
have more money than God, constantly brag on television talk shows about how 
they are ignorant and "durn proud of it!", and have never needed any 
education to make all that money.  People who can hardly talk consider that 
society's accolades of showers of money make them experts on all kinds of 
social and psychological issues, and reinforce the message to the "vidiot" 
generation that paying attention in school is a total waste of time.  And you 
(and Mr. Blumenberg) then want to blame the shortcomings of public education 
on teachers?  Given all these factors, I find the fact that public education 
functions AT ALL nothing short of miraculous!

Before we throw out the baby with the bath water, we ought to consider that 
the public school system, besides the obvious functions, also provides a 
great equalizing system; in that most of the population of the United States 
shares common experiences:  sitting at those little desks with "Mary Sue 
loves Bobby" carved into them, having your tongue stick to those little 
wooden "spoons" while eating ice cream from little cups, being chased by the 
playground bully, and generally having to deal with people with whom one 
would rather not associate.

These experiences provide a common fabric that ties us all together in the 
warp and woof of its weave, and help to keep us headed in something of a 
common direction as we travel through life.  Take these shared experiences 
away, and you leave us with the situation outlined most clearly in countries 
like the former Yugoslavia; in which the lack of shared experience and common 
referents causes the total destruction of both society and culture.

And so, having become quite prolix myself, I conclude by suggesting that we 
ought to recognize that our education system has performed miracles in both 
providing a culture that allows us to enjoy freedoms and a standard of living 
unlike any mankind has ever seen, and a basis to expand those freedoms and 
living standards in directions we can only imagine.  Let's stop dumping the 
blame for all our problems on teachers and place it where it really belongs: 
on ourselves, for not accepting our responsibilities as parents and for 
spending too many Sundays, doing carrot imitations, beer in hand on the sofa,  
while a bunch of highly-paid illiterates perform ritualized combat in the 
best tradition of the Roman circuses on the tube.  Instead of just bitching 
about the problems we perceive in the public schools, let's get together and 
shoulder the responsibility of fixing them.  After all, we have an 
infrastructure investment there of billions of dollars, and we can ill afford 
to pay the social and economic costs of throwing the whole system out and 
starting over from scratch.

On a separate, but related, topic, one of the failed hopes of the BBS world 
in my view is the promise of forums for conversations on topics such as the 
one above.  Search as I may, I have been unable to find a place where such 
discussions are going on.  As the BBS world promises to be the medium of 
choice for communication in the future, I submit that we need to develop 
places for such conversations.  Both your editorials and the letters your 
readers write show a pent up demand for such a forum, yet we have not 
provided an outlet for this demand.

I would be delighted to hear you comments on  either or both of these 
subjects.

 Nigel Mends
 Compuserve 71174, 2523

 Nigel:

Ok.  I'll buy it.  But I want some pretty big things in return.  FIRST, if 
there are any inaccuracies in this issue of Boardwatch, we will agree they 
are the READERS fault.  Secondly, any color anomalies are the printers fault.  
If any of the pages are out of order, it's Gary's fault.  If I say something 
stupid, it's YOUR fault.  And if you don't get this issue at all, for 
whatever reason of nondelivery, it's your wife's fault.  Or my wife's fault.  
Or perhaps Clinton's fault.

In the REAL world I live in Mr. Mends, anything in Boardwatch that isn't up 
to snuff really is MY responsibility.  This is total, unrelenting, 
unforgiving, merciless, and I not only accept it, I approve of the whole 
system.  If you don't get your issue, call me.  I replace it at MY expense 
and with all due haste we can muster.  I live in a world where it is a 
PRIVILEGE to be read and the highest compliment in the world to be paid for - 
in mailboxes across 60 countries that GROAN under the weight of things 
waiting to be read.  But it is a curiously unforgiving industry.  If I fail, 
the world simply turns away to other things and I am forgotten in a universe 
of 26,000 periodical publications.

Teachers, by contrast, have complained bitterly of lack of money, while 
funding for the education of our children has TRIPLED to some $6500 per 
student per year.  Now, the story is that parents are unfeeling, uncaring, 
uncommitted monsters who did a fun thing in a jacuzzi somewhere, stopped by 
the hospital 3/4 of a year later, and then dumped the result on the school 
house steps on the way to their next Perrier party.  It's our society.  It's 
our parents.  It's the administrators.  It's Supreme Court rulings.  It's 
busing. In the letter you refer to, it was TV and junk food.

Nigel - what it is is heartbreakingly simple - no stones.  There is no one in 
a profession employing millions of individuals in pretty good style and at a 
public expense of billions and billions of dollars with the strength of 
character, vision, or upbringing to say "I stand responsible for this, and I 
will fix it."

Until someone DOES say that, the various elements in the machine, the printer 
communications, dealing with the post office, adopting the latest page layout 
technology and getting it to work, selecting articles, graphics, researching 
technologies, dialing online services, retail distribution agreements - they 
don't matter, and they don't count. No one needs or wants to hear about it - 
they are excuses, not causes. They certainly aren't the reasons for failure.  
They don't matter for magazines, and tv, junk food, parents, society, the 
welfare state, buses, funding, student motivation, pressure groups, unions, 
societal decay, guns in the classroom - don't matter for education. These are 
structural elements of a process - not a result.

Eventually, if no one IN education does take responsibility, someone outside 
of it will.  Three things come to my mind immediately.  One - I CAN fix it.  
Two - you and almost everyone else IN the education field will be MUCH 
happier if I don't. And three, there are many out there who would be even 
less pleasant and considered about it than I would be.

 To whom it may concern;

I'm not sure who to direct this to, so the title will have to do. I purchased 
a copy of your magazine last month, and read it cover-to-cover. It's been a 
long time since I've done that with any periodical. I decided to cast a vote 
for my favorite BBS. Much to my surprise, I received a copy of this month's 
edition in the mail today, and was thrilled. I've already read through it, 
and I'm looking forward to the next edition. I'm not sure why I received 
anything, although it does mention that I voted in the contest on the 
shipping label. I've purchased other communications periodicals in the last 
few months as well as read Modem News on a local board here in Philly. Your 
magazine far exceeds anything else I've read, and is generously 
text-oriented, a real short coming of others, namely, Online Access. So I'd 
just like to post a note of thanks and appreciation to the culprit 
responsible, and also would like to add that I pass the magazine on to 
friends. It's real hard to find your magazine on any racks, and I'm limited 
to one book store, and if you're not one of the first to get it..then you 
miss the boat. Being disabled, I really appreciate the sometimes critical 
info. that you exhibit. To some, I guess that's not important, but for me, 
more times than not, this computer and modem is my mode of transportation.

 Thanks again,
 Sincerely;

 Bill:

Well, Nigel, there's the good side to being the "responsible" culprit.

Seriously, Mr. Hartzell, we're pleased we're hitting the mark in Philly.  We 
are battling the retail distribution thing pretty hard.  We win some, we lose 
some.  Basically, if we tell stores they will need more Boardwatch because 
we're good and they will sell out in four days, they are a bit skeptical, 
probably understandably enough.  But we are winning one store at a time. 
Typically, they have to deal with dozens and in some cases hundreds of 
titles.  Our newsstand performance falls a little out of their "typical 
magazine" range.

We mail Boardwatch to selected "balloters" in our contest in a crafty effort 
to enlist the post office in our validation process.  Works pretty well 
actually. And if you took the time to vote, you deserve a copy.  The way the 
world works, almost every time, is that the harder you try to give it away, 
the more it comes back. I keep having to learn that part for some reason.  We 
really did intend it as a "thank you" for those voting, and we probably get 
as many subscriptions back as a result of this as anything we do.  If I can 
ever figure out what it is we're doing right, I promise we'll do a LOT more 
of it.

I enjoy being a subscriber to your publication and think it is a great 
resource for information about the online community. My reason for this 
letter is to complain about is the "Marlboro" stories you have run in two 
recent issues.

Marlboro sells cigarettes. In order to get more recognition of their brand 
name, they sponsor events like the racing. This allows them to use 
familiarity and association techniques to later sell those fine tobacco 
products once you are in your local store.

Why keep mentioning Marlboro in your publication and even printing their logo 
(twice in the picture from the August issue)? This is yet another ad from 
this company, and will help to sell cigarettes (whether you intend it to or 
not).

Unless, of course, Phillip Morris is PAYING you to run these photos.

Sometimes I'm sure I MUST have just hauled in on the Pumpkin wagon.  There is 
so MUCH about this world I don't have a clue how it works or how it got so 
hosed before my arrival.

First, what's wrong with Marlboro, what's wrong with them selling cigarettes, 
why should I care whether they do or don't, and most curiously, why should 
you?

Marlboro isn't paying ME to run these photos, I'm paying THEM.  Or at least 
Jim Thompson, who's done a bangup job with a series of articles on "graphics 
online."   In case you were out of the country, this is a hot area of 
interest online. This is a perniciously technical area that is developing 
widely and narrowly on dozens of fronts at once.  I'm inadequate to the task 
of doing it well.

Mr. Thompson runs Marlboro Racing News, a BBS with a somewhat unique mission 
to take photos of automobile races, and put them up on a BBS in a matter of 
minutes for about 400 journalists around the world who download them and put 
them in their newspapers.  These people need an easy graphic interface - and 
photos. This rather puts the onus on Mr. Thompson to stay at the edge of this 
technology, and the funding to do it to whatever degree it can 
technologically be done.  But his main line of business is running Western 
News Service - and writing.  So I found someone who CAN write, AND has a 
vested interest in keeping up with this graphics technology, AND a heck of a 
nice guy, AND willing to help me with this.  And as I understand it, YOU 
DON'T LIKE HIS HAT!

And I don't even understand the first part of WHY you don't like his hat. 
Marlboro is a company.  They sell cigarettes, they sponsor a Marlboro 
automotive racing team (doing pretty well this season actually), and 
apparently they make a baseball cap for Jim. If you are implying that by a 
terribly complex ruse, they have plotted and planned to get this in 
Boardwatch, I'm flattered, but confused.  If you are worried they will sell 
more cigarettes, I hope they do.  If you just wanted to write a letter, the 
hot topics now are education, the Internet, and Amiga abuse.

As it so happens, I smoke about two packs of Pall Mall's a day - they're made 
by American Tobacco Company and can be found "Wherever Particular People 
Congregate." I hope they sell an extra truckload or too as well - to kids, 
environmentalists, and educators.

 Dear Mr. Rickard and Mr. Gram-Reefer,

This is just a quick note to thank you for the kind words you printed about 
my classroom in the August issue of Boardwatch.  I truly believe that people 
outside of the Education field should know about the good things kids do in 
the classroom.  By printing an article about my class, you have spread the 
message that kids can do productive and meaningful projects in the classroom 
if/when given the right tools.

Is it possible that the people at KidLink/Kidcafe can post the article in  
their library???  They will give proper credit to Mr. Gram-Reefer and  
Boardwatch.

Again, thanks for the kind words.

 Sincerely,

 Dear Jack:

Ok, I was reading the July 1993 "Letters to the Editor", and I saw someone 
highly praising ROBOboard...I seem to agree...It's much like the traditional 
RemoteAccess or SuperBBS, but with EGA /VGA graphics.  Hudson Message Base & 
all... But, while computers are speedily upgrading, EGA/VGA/SVGA, 
286/386/486, there are some (one of my best friends comes to mind) who run an 
8088, one floppy not even 640k, putting along on a 2400 modem, plus a CGA 
monitor.

The question is, what to do with the users not supported by the RoboTerm VGA 
interface?  The answer, either run 2 bbs's (which I did for a while), or dump 
RoboBoard!  No real SysOp, serving the community, can alienate all CGA users!

The Answer: Go RIP or NAPLPS.  I support RIP, only because both Renegade and 
Synchronet (The 2 best softwares on the market at this time, in my opinion) 
support RIP well.  I hear NAPLPS is a nice graphics protocol, but it seems 
most major BBS programs (Wildcat, MajorBBS, and others...) have already made 
their descisions.  Sorry NAPLPS people....

So, I think MajorBBS is doomed, until it can support the users without EGA or 
VGA.  What'cha think?

 Josh:

I think you are one very confused person, and take it as a personal failure 
that we haven't explained this better in Boardwatch.

First, major BBS programs make "their decisions" every day and tomorrow they 
get to make them again.  Those that don't fall by the way and leave it to 
others willing to innovate every time they finish breakfast.  Nothing is 
"done" in this industry.

Second, MajorBBS has nothing to do with NAPLPS, in fact they are one of the 
heartiest proponents of RIP, which you apparently like because it doesn't 
abandon CGA.  Actually, RIP is solely EGA and this hardware dependence is the 
most broken thing about it, while NAPLPS does offer some true hardware 
independence.

Finally, I think if any "true sysop serving the community" did alienate all 
the CGA users, I don't think anyone would notice.

 Hi Jack,

Read your recent article on demos in Boardwatch.  What a timely 
(coincidental) thing u I recently tried out a couple demos on a friend's 
machine that happens to be equipped with SVGA and a SoundBlaster.

I can guarantee as much as you enjoyed viewing the demos on a computer with 
the PC speaker, the experience is ten times as intense once you have a SB 
hooked up.  One demo was all it took to convince me that I _had_ to get this 
sound board for my next computer (which I am buying this weekend). Anyway, 
for the hundred bucks, you should treat yourself to a SB.  I'm not being paid 
to say this or anything, but the combination of slick graphics, amazing 
sound, and a little good programming yields a REALLY excellent experience.   
Dim the house lights, crank up the speakers, and you've got yourself a 
tremendous show.

Good luck & as usual, great mag.

I think something like "demos" or "intros" will finally get sound cards off 
the ground in a big way, and get them universally installed.  We had some 
amazing response to the article on demos and plan a followup for an issue 
soon.  John Smith of Gravis sent us CRYSTAL DREAM II demo with one of his 
superb Gravis sound cards and yeah, we're a little wowed.  Crystal Dream 
demo, by Triton, was reviewed in our August issue.  We have it on the 
Boardwatch BBS now as CD1.ZIP and the Crystal Dream II demo as CD2.ZIP.  We 
think this is an emerging new art form, and we predict big things for this 
stuff in the future.  If you haven't seen these, grab them and run them now, 
before they mature and get really interesting.

I just finished reading your editorial in August Boardwatch.  I read the 
first two pages and agreed with everything you said u in fact at the bottom 
of the second page I decided to write to ask you if I could quote it to some 
of the educational bureaucrats I deal with. Then I came to your paragraph on 
the third page:

> One reader actually sent us a flyer from a Maine educational BBS that had
> Consumed some $180,000 in grant money used to operate a single line
> Macintosh BBS with 2400 bps modem and no graphics and had had OVER 400
> CALLERS log onto the system during the period.  Be still my heart.

Waal, shucks ...

(1) We're a disabilities board, not an educational board.

(2) The $180,000 is totally bogus u we budgeted $60,000 for the first year, 
of which a great deal went to the telephone company for 800 access (required 
by our funders) and some of the rest went to purchase a bulk lot of old 
Viewtron Sceptres to pass out to consumers.

(3) It was a multiline system running TBBS 2.2M16 and using v.32bis modems.

(4) We defaulted ANSI to OFF in deference to the many users who were logging 
on for the first time ever using Sceptres u but ANSI was available for anyone 
who wanted to go turn it on.

The reader who sent you the misinformation is a frustrated shrink who got his 
nose out of joint because he tried to sell access to his private board to the 
Department of Mental Health and Mental Retardation, and they turned him down 
flat.  He's been targeting our operation ever since, and no matter how often 
we publish the truth, he always pops up somewhere else with his fiction.

I realize that it's unreasonable to expect you to check the truth of 
statements like his u one of the unsolved issues of the new electronic age, 
after all, is how to winnow out the deliberate misinformation u but I wish, 
just a little bit, that you'd refrained from echoing it to the electronic 
world.

If PIMP v.2.19 will really handle enclosed files, I will send along a zipfile 
(packed with 1.01, sorry!) containing some additional messages on the topic 
which you might find enlightening.  They're part of an exchange of messages 
between me and our mutual acquaintance on the topic of his misstatements.

The rest of your editorial is so exactly on target that I'd still like 
permission to repeat it u maybe read it in a VERY LOUD VOICE u to the 
public-policy types here who still think the sun rises and sets on GTE 
SpecialNet.   That's one of the reasons we bought PIMP and got a domain name 
u not because we aspired to become those people's carrier (after all, there 
are plenty of private operations who can do that job and make a legitimate 
profit at it) but because we just want to get it through their heads that 
such a thing exists.  The day we see that they've really gotten the message u 
and have got off their control trips u we'll go quietly away, and the public 
coffers will be safe again for the next generation.  Until that time, we're 
darn proud of what we've done and we're going to keep doing it u as long as 
you and Phil Becker continue to do your respective parts.

 Sincerely,
 Lou McIntosh
 Sysop, Maine Meeting Place

 Lou:

Thanks for one of the most entertaining confessions I've read in a long 
while.  We've all thoroughly enjoyed it.  Yes, PIMP does do file attachments 
and I did get yours.  The war with your frustrated shrink friend is 
hysterical, but irrelevant. And I'm afraid you're going to find this 
embarrassing.

Actually, we DO make mistakes. This just wasn't one of them. I do generally 
make an effort to get the "facts" straight.  There is a reason why we got 
them a little hosed in your case.  As you point out, YOUR grant was $60,0000, 
not $180,000, you run a multiline TBBS system - not a single line Macintosh, 
you run V.32bis modems, not 2400 bps, in short - what, aside from some sort 
of "grant guilt", made you think we were talking about YOUR BBS?

Amazingly, we also received two other letters with basically the same theme - 
neither so hysterically self-confessing as yours - but both taking umbrage at 
our characterization of their system.  Since there are only 60 or so bulletin 
boards in the whole state of Maine, I think we've unearthed the latest trend 
- grant scams with sysops suffering the pangs of guilt for accepting 
thousands of dollars of public money to do what they know can be done for 
pennies.  We did NOT hear from the sysop of the system we actually mentioned, 
which we did not mention by name, but just noted it's description as you have 
quoted.

For what it's worth, I think a multiline V.32bis system at $60,000 is a MUCH 
better deal for the taxpayer than a single line 2400 bps Macintosh system for 
$180,000, even if it is for disabilities rather than education.

But - thanks for writing.

 Jack,

Immediately after receiving the Boardwatch with the PageSat article in it, 
Sean, the sysop of Data World BBS in Knoxville (Public 615-675-4753, private 
615-675-3282) purchased the system.  After installing it we found that there 
is no real standard way of integrating 4,000 news groups into PCBOARD.  We 
looked at putting them into conferences, but decided not to as that seemed to 
required huge amounts of maintenance time, almost continuous message packs, 
and a 300 meg USERS.IDX file for us.

Instead we decided to use the Waffle utilities for importing.  We are using 
the ZNEWS door for user access to the newsgroups, and for private mail 
capability.  There was no on-line reader available for viewing news articles 
that we found to our liking, so I wrote one, called USENET.  It allows a user 
to view the Usenet news, all 4000 groups, and uses exactly the same hierarchy 
as the newsgroups themselves use.  Selection is done via cursor keys.  This 
software is available both from Data World, as well as Salt Air BBS.  It can 
be used on Data World by typing USENET at the main board prompt.  The setup 
seems to be well liked by our users.

The mail insertion is handled by Waffle's RNEWS utility, which is called when 
a bag is ready by Jack Kilday's PageNews program (jkliday@nlbbs.com).  This 
program allows us to run a batch file after each bag is inserted, and the 
batch file checks disk space and runs expire whenever the news drive has less 
than 20 meg remaining on it.  The only disadvantage we have found to the 
setup is that Waffle makes each newsgroup a subdirectory, and each news item 
is a file.  With files of approximatley 1k each, residing in clusters of 8k 
each, the news drive becomes very inefficient unless Stacker or similar is 
used.

The PageSat system installed easily.  The only problem we had initially was 
that the horn was mounted 90 degrees from what was needed, and we could not 
receive any signal until it was rotated.  Here in Eastern Tennessee the 
humidity and clouds are a problem.  We receive quite a few garbled mail bags 
every day and it is not unusual during heavy cloud cover to lose the feed for 
hours at a time.  We have been working with PageSat, re-aligned the dish, and 
installed an in-line amplifier, but all to no avail.  PageSat is sending us a 
.75 meter dish to replace the 18" dish, and I feel certain that will fix the 
problems.  Garbled mail bags can be a significant problem as RNEWS will 
sometimes lock up or give a QEMM exception error.  It also tends to export 
any news with a garbled header back to the Internet with a new and totally 
wrong header.

I appreciate the Interenet articles in Boardwatch.  At first it was all Greek 
to me, but I can see it is rapidly becoming the way things are going.  Keep 
up the good work!

 Marshall Dudley
 dwbbs!mdudley@nlbbs.com

 Marshall:

Since our June article, we have received numerous reports of garbled data, 
weather problems, and so forth with PageSat.  We tried to contact PageSat 
several times to do a followup and some detailed testing, but they won't even 
return our calls - a fairly unusual response from someone we've put on the 
cover of Boardwatch. Oh, well....

One of the many things I like about the online world is the grassroots driver 
behind all of it.  If something doesn't work the way you want it to, you just 
by Jimminy go write something different to make it do what you want.  It's a 
story repeated a dozen times a day, and some of these solutions cause 
companies and industries, and...oh... I get all misty just thinking about it.

For those who are new to the game, Marshall Dudley is the author of DOORWAY, 
an early program to let anyone write a program and run it as a door on a BBS.  
It eventually emerged as a full-featured remote access program and one of the 
most fascinating and flexible tools used for communicating in BBSland.

Thanks for updating us on your latest work.  As you know, we think the 
Internet connection for  bulletin boards is a pregnant one.  We need all the 
tools we can get.

 Bill,

I completely forgot! Here's something you may, or may not want to mention. In 
the July 1993 issue of BoardWatch, the cover story dealt with how one could 
grab Space Shuttle photos over the Internet. Here's a relatively painless way 
to do that using a Mac which has MacTCP and NCSA/Telnet v2.5. Following the 
article's advice, one telnets to sseop.jsc.nasa.gov. Then, assuming one has 
turned the Capture file on, you grab a listing of available images. You can 
proceed by enabling FTP access from within NCSA/Telnet, which means that the 
two-step process outlined in the article becomes a single step for the 
well-connected Mac owner. I tried this out over the weekend and it worked and 
even worked pretty well. Due to the huge file sizes, it looks like the 
connection has hung until you realize that the hard drive is spinning 
furiously in the background all the while as your requested file is 
downloaded. When I finished grabbing a couple of these files, I used JPEG 
converter v1.0 (available for free from sumex-aim and posted on Spider 
Island) to interpret the Targa files and batch-convert them into JPEG files. 
Then I used JPEG View v2.0 to preview the files and used the "Save as..." 
option to automatically generate those nifty previews that TeleFinder v3.1 
can now display on screen.

Keep in mind that I am lost when it comes to graphics programs! If I knew how 
to operate PhotoShop I would, no doubt, have some rather spectacular files. 
As it is, I have some very nice images and some which are really stunning. I 
was a happy, if somewhat exhausted, camper by the end of the night.

 Jack:

My August edition of BoardWatch Magazine arrived. Delighted in your editorial 
titled "The Emancipation Constipation of Electronic Mail." I have a few 
observations:

I agree with your thesis that the local BBS will be the average user's 
connection to Internet/USENET (BTW, what is a "backplane"?). As you state, 
local BBSs are "cheap" and people already know how to use them.

Your thinking on this subject is innovative. In the 1990 edition of _Dvorak's 
Guide to Telecommunications_ the WELL (p178) is described as One of the 
few[!] places where any individual with a computer and modem can become a 
terminal in this huge international network [UUCP and USENET] that connects 
universities, businesses, and research institutions."

However, for your vision to become a reality, several difficulties must be 
overcome. One difficulty in particular is the present QWK mail format.

As you state, if we are to have Internet/USENET on local BBSs (probably using 
a UUCP-type connection), offline mail readers are *critical*. I subscribe to 
a local BBS (Cloud Nine BBS) which carries more than 2,500 USENET conferences 
(plus fidonet, etc). On average, using the QWK mail format, I download a 
paltry 300 messages a day (this takes less than 5 minutes on my 14.4 bps 
modem). If I were a "conference junky" I could easily download over 1,000 
messages a day. Reading and occasionally responding to these messages would 
be impractical without an offline mail reader (its sorts my conference mail 
by "threads" and permits me to place obnoxious writers on a "kill" list). Yet 
the QWK mail format is not completely compatible with the Internet/USENET 
offline format (my reading tells me that Internet offline mail uses 
RFC1036/RFC822). For example, the subject field of most USENET messages is 
truncated by QWK. Furthermore, QWK does not provide enough space in the "TO:" 
field for the complete Internet "at-sign syntax" address. This limitation 
looks increasingly regressive now that PCBoard version 15.0 has increased the 
size of the address fields. In sum, the present QWK format is restricting the 
ability of most local BBS to bring Internet/USENET to the masses.

I know that other people have developed proprietary formats (for example, 
BlueWave and Rosemail) that overcome the shortcomings of the QWK format. 
However, we need a standard that everyone can take advantage of.

I am a strong fan of offline readers for another reason. It encourages people 
to edit and spell-check their messages before sending. Messages become more 
concise and thoughtful. The time delay of offline mail provides a check to 
impulsive "flame-mail."

The *critical* nature of QWK is not appreciated by everyone. Approximately a 
year ago, I recall discussing the need for TBBS to have an offline mail 
capability. I was told there was few requests for this feature. The last I 
looked, the TBBS offline reader was still not compatible with PKWare ZIP 
version 2.04g because upgrading the software was a low priority.

I believe the BBS community needs to get together and agree on a new standard 
for offline mail (QW2?) that's compatible with Internet and meets future 
needs. This community has moved quickly in the past when properly focused. I 
still recall how quickly the BBS community changed "en mass" from the ARC to 
the ZIP file compression format.

Perhaps *you* could get the BBS community to make a new offline mail format a 
*priority* at the One BBSCON convention August 25-29. A new format would 
remove one roadblock on the journey of bringing Internet to the local BBS 
user.

 Sincerely
 John Vindekilde.

 John:

And you WANT WHAT YOU WANT WHEN YOU WANT IT - RIGHT?

I couldn't agree with your comments more John - frontwards and backwards.  
And I think you'll find Sparky Herring, the original author of QWK, in 
agreement as well.  But the world is in a process of making - it isn't over 
yet.  QWK was designed to do a small thing, and has been rode hard and put 
away wet.  Sparky nor anyone else ever imagined all that would be asked of 
QWK. It's not a young standard. And now it is everywhere and has a bit of a 
life of its own.  If anyone can change that, it would be Sparky, but I 
imagine he's wondering at this point if even HE can change a world gone QWK 
mad.

But yes, Mr. Herring has a session at ONE BBSCON, prominently featured.  We 
stand ready to extend that with working meetings.  I expect a QWK II will be 
announced or come out of it, and I would predict one of the main elements 
will be more facility with RFC-822 style Internet messages.

Cross your legs...

 Howdy!

First a quick line to say how much I enjoy your Boardwatch magazine.. 
definitely the best source for bbs news and views!

Now, on to the juicy part.. in reference to an article appearing in the June 
a93 issue concerning the new RIP graphics protocol I'd like to mention there 
is a new freeware RIP drawing program out there (DPAIN11.ARJ) which may fit 
the bill for all those sysops out there who otherwise can't afford to pay for 
the Telegraphix paint program ($200.! Ouch!)... of course, the features are 
spartan but it will get anyone started in the right direction.

Second, a statement was made in the same article re: Imagen's Fracterm 
product being the only current interface supporting photo-realistic images 
online... this is no longer true! Shawn Rhoads of TurBoard fame (PC Atlanta 
1-404-395-6327 14.4k) has released a GIF2NAP GIF to NAPLPS conversion utility 
that will convert GIFS from 2 to 256-colors to NAPLPS with NO loss of 
resolution! Its quick, easy to use, with a mouse interface (for selecting any 
portion of the GIF for conversion) and the resulting NAPLPS frames may be 
viewed with either TurShow or displayed online any TurBoard bbs v1.20 or 
above.. a truly wondrous and remarkable advance, allowing any sysop to create 
and display photo-realistic images online his/her TurBoard bbs.

BTW- both utilities are available for d/l online Shawn's bbs.

Cheers, and keep up the good work with Boardwatch!

 TELEBITS
 ========


AT&T is introducing a new feature on their long distance service they call 
TrueVoice.  It dramatically improves the sound quality of voice conversations 
and may in fact improve data transmission as well.  The feature is not an 
option, but will be automatically added to all AT&T long distance switches.  
The upgrade will begin in September of 1993.

The technology, originally developed by Bell Labs, increases bass response 
and also increases total audio volume through the switch across the 
bandwidth.  The result is much more realistic sound for voice conversations.  
The company currently has a demo line up at (800)932-2000 where you can 
listen to Tom Sellack (Magnum) ooze an unctuous line of AT&T spiel with the 
old, moldy technology, (press 1), or the new, improved, high-speed trick 
double throw me down TrueVoice (press 2).  The demo is pretty impressive, 
despite our personal preference for Higgins voice. You can also press 0 at 
the end of the demo to connect directly to an AT&T service rep to have your 
long distance service changed for free right then.  Actually, it sounds 
pretty hot to us.  But note that we have not as yet actually tested modems on 
this new service.

An interesting bit of legislation has been introduced in both houses of 
Congress.  Titled the SPACE ADVERTISING PROHIBITION ACT, it denies launch 
licenses for space billboards, bans import of products advertized on space 
billboards, and asks the President to seek an international agreement banning 
space advertising.  The legislation comes out of plans to put a mile-long 
inflatable billboard with lit messages in orbit around earth - which could 
substantially change the ambiance of that starry, starry night.

ALSO on the legislative front, Senators Danforth and Inouye introduced the 
Telecommunications Infrastructure Act of 1993 as Senate Bill 1086 on July 
14th. This may be the most seminal piece of legislation regarding 
telecommunications introduced since the 1930's.  The Senate Communications 
Subcommittee is now in the process of thrashing it out, but the heart of the 
bill would ELIMINATE the legal monopoly currently enjoyed by local telephone 
companies in local telephone service.  It would allow ANY communications 
provider to offer local telephone service. As part of the buyoff there, it 
would also allow local telcos into the cable TV business.

The bill contains many provisions revolving around interconnection 
obligations (everyone has to), telephone number portability (you can change 
phone services and keep your old telephone number) and a lot of thrashing 
about rural and non-competitive markets in an effort to retain the current 
"universal service" philosophy.  While this bill has some problems and is 
unlikely to get through the telco/cable lobby meat grinder unscathed, at its 
heart it incorporates almost completely the position published in a 
Boardwatch editorial in 1988 asserting that every man with a battered pickup 
and a rusty pair of pliers be allowed to offer local telephone service.

A lot of things COULD come out of passage of this bill.  First, local 
telephone companies would finally be able to offer cable tv to the home, a 
market they never will make any money at but which they have lusted after in 
their heart for years.  This always was going to be the ONLY way fiber to the 
home will ever happen.  It is quite likely that you will have glass to your 
house late Tuesday of the week after this bill goes into effect.  The local 
telcos are that wired on the concept of being in the cable business.

Windows NT appears imminent.  Some of the last minute additions would seem to 
be a bone to the communications world - most notably an FTP SERVER and 
expanded TCP/IP features.  With pre-emptive multitasking, strong LAN server 
functions,  and good Internet features, this smells like a good platform for 
online services.

But OS/2 isn't giving up.  The best kept secret in the industry right now, 
and I mean virtually a secret, is IBM's TCP/IP for OS/2.  OS/2 2.1 appears to 
be a working platform, with good serial port support.  The TCP/IP connection 
here seems like a pretty full bag - SLIP included.  Something is going to 
break here either late this year or early next with a BBS package designed to 
take advantage of all this.  Most likely guess - Andrew Milner's Remote 
Access.  RA is very popular in many countries, quite flexible, and they are 
looking for life as a commercial package.  Windows NT or OS/2 would give them 
the multi-line part they need, and some good TCP/IP Internet functionality 
would give them the WOW feature they need to break out of shareware and 
become a viable option.

 WORST TECHNICAL MANUAL CONTEST
 ------------------------------

Any technical support person can tell you that at least 90% of all support 
calls are covered by RTFM - loosely translated this means the customer 
probably could have found just what they needed had they bothered to look in 
the manual.  And any software customer can also note another truism - the 
manual isn't any good.

If both of these are true - the information is in the manual, and the 
customer can't find it, the product documentation isn't entirely doing its 
job.  Some do, and some really don't.

The Communication Circle, a group of technical writers led by Jonathan Price, 
author of "Put That in Writing" (Viking Press), is sponsoring a competition 
titled "The Worst Manual of the Year."  The contest is directed at shaming 
product vendors into improving their documentation.  You may submit a manual, 
with a letter nominating it as the worst manual of the year.  If your 
candidate places in the competition, you'll receive a T-shirt with "I 
fingered the Worst Manual of the Year, 1993" with an imprint of the cover of 
the winning (??) manual on it.  You also get a copy of Price's book, and a 
certificate of honor in the war against useless manuals.

The winning vendor also gets a certificate - a garish Certificate of Bad 
Taste, along with a copy of Price's other book "How to Communicate Technical 
Information."  To nominate a book, send a copy of it with a letter outlining 
your complaints to The Worst Manual of the Year, c/o The Communication 
Circle, 918 La Senda N.W., Albuquerque, NM 87107.  The deadline is Holloween, 
1993 and the winners will be announced on December 7, 1993. Inquiries can be 
directed to T. Outler at itso@hydra.unm.edu.

 CD-ROM CONNECTION FOR NOVELL
 ----------------------------

Connecting a CD-ROM drive to a Novell server should be easy.  Plug in a drive 
with an SCSI controller, and make happy. Those who try this find they have 
just entered a new world of "you can't get there from here - you have to go 
somewhere else first."

Microtest, Inc. of Phoenix Arizona has a new product that does simplify 
things a bit - for a price. Their new $695 Discport product connects to the 
BNC or 10BaseT LAN wiring.  About the size of a videocassette, it terminates 
in an SCSI cable that allows you to connect up to seven CD ROM drives.  The 
server software supplied with it makes these CD-ROM drives look like any 
other published hard drive on a Novell Netware server, and may comprise one 
of the best and easiest solutions to putting CD-ROM drives on a Novell 
Network.  Microtest, Inc., (602)952-6400.

 SUPRA LOWERS SYSOP PRICE to $149.95 - ENHANCES SUPRAFAXMODEM V.32bis
 --------------------------------------------------------------------

With a growing price war in the 14,400 bps V.32bis modem market, Supra 
Corporation made a bold pricing move with a July announcement to reduce sysop 
prices on the popular SupraFAXModem V.32bis external model to $149.95 and to 
$129.95 on the internal model.

"Sysops are on the cutting edge of communications technology and we feel it 
is important to support them in the work of evangelizing and supporting 
high-speed communications," said John Wiley, president of Supra.  "To achieve 
this goal, we've lowered the sysop pricing on our top-of-the-line modems 
while also adding some performance enhancements to the products."

These modems include the latest Rockwell chipsets and Supra's most recent 
firmware revisions to improve operation of the Supra - most notably improving 
high-speed operation on noisy lines.  The new firmware also eliminates some 
isolated problems in connecting with other specific modem brands.

The units feature the 14,400 bps speed for both fax and data operations, 
V.42/42bis, and include Caller ID as a standard feature.  If caller ID is 
available from the telecommunications provider, BBS operators can use it for 
such functions as automatic identification and logon of BBS users.

Qualified sysop orders are fulfilled in 24 hours.  Ordering information is 
available in the online order area of the Supra BBS. The modems feature an 
unusually generous five year warranty. If users have a problem with a modem, 
for a $20 fee Supra sends out a replacement modem and return mailer for the 
old one by overnight carrier to anywhere in the United States - virtually 
eliminating downtime. For sysops who have already purchased older 
SupraFAXModems, upgrades are provided free of charge as they become 
available. For more information, call Supra's BBS at (503)967-2444 or the 
sales voice line at (800)727-8772.

 OKLAHOMA BBS RAIDED ON PORNOGRAPHY CHARGES
 ------------------------------------------

The legal assault on bulletin boards continues this month with a raid by 
Oklahoma City Police Department Vice Division on Tony Davis's

OKLAHOMA INFORMATION EXCHANGE BBS and his associated Mid-America Digital 
Publishing Company.

About 4:00 PM on July 20, four officers of the Oklahoma City Police 
Department arrived at the offices of Mid-America Digital Publishing with a 
search warrant for "pornographic CD-ROMs."   Davis was arrested on suspicion 
of the sale and distribution of pornographic CD-ROM disks.  Of the 2000 CD 
ROM disks available on site, they confiscated about 50 disks, and an 
estimated $75,000 worth of equipment Davis runs his 10-line OKLAHOMA 
INFORMATION EXCHANGE BBS on.  The equipment including two computers with 
gigabyte hard drives, two Pioneer 6-disk drives, four single CD ROM drives, 
10 High Speed Hayes modems, Novell network software and associated hardware, 
etc.

Apparently, an undercover agent had contacted Mid-America Digital Publishing 
on two occasions and purchased CD-ROM disks containing adult material from 
the company.  At the raid, Davis cooperated with the police showing them 
whatever they wanted to see, and even removing four disks from CD-ROMS on the 
BBS machine and showing them to the police.  Curiously, these were standard 
off-the-shelf CD ROM collections NOT published by Davis, including "Busty 
Babes", "For Adults Only #2," "For Adults Only #3", and "Storm II".  More 
curiously, the police themselves put the disks BACK into the BBS in order to 
video tape callers accessing the files on the disks.

Videotape seemed to play a major role in the raid.  Department employees 
filmed the entire raid, and released the film to the press which played it on 
all three local tv network affiliate stations.

Despite Davis' notification, none of the specific procedures required by 
federal law (Privacy Protection Act) when serving search warrants on 
publishers was followed, and no acknowledgement or even apparent cognizance 
of the Electronic Communications Privacy Act made when notified of the 
electronic mail for some 2000 BBS users available on the system.  OKLAHOMA 
INFORMATION EXCHANGE carries some 750 FidoNet conferences, an additional 750 
Usenet Newsgroups, and offers callers private FidoNet mail and Internet mail 
and actually hubs mail for other bulletin board systems as well.

Ironically, Davis DID have a thriving CD-ROM publishing business that 
produces the Magnum series of CD-ROM's including "Magnum 1," "Magnum Games 
and Windows," and "Magnum Sight and Sound."  But NONE of Davis's own titles 
had ANY adult material on them at all - they are entirely "G" rated titles.  
The CD-ROMS of interest to the Oklahoma City Police were all titles by other 
publishers that Davis resold.

Davis was released on bail of $4500 and faced arraignment on August 3rd.  No 
formal charges were brought on that date, and the prosecutor asked for a 
delay with no specific new date brought.  One complication that has already 
arisen, aside from the blatant infractions of the PPA and ECPA, was that the 
warrant was fairly specific about CD-ROM discs.  The seizure of the BBS 
equipment appears to be outside the scope of the warrant - a perhaps 
unfortunate improvisation by the officers at the scene.

And Davis may have been the wrong person to pick as a test case.  A fairly 
mature, strong willed individual with some financial resource, Davis is 
represented by Attorney William R. Holmes. While we could not entice him to 
speak directly to the case, he did not seem a happy camper, and didn't seem 
too cowed by it all at this point.  With the very public televised bust, the 
city appears to be in the difficult position of now wishing it would all go 
away without a lawsuit, and no real way to get there from here.

All possible charges relate to Oklahoma State statutes against obscenity.  
Located in the heart of the Bible Belt, this could be serious. A penalty of 
up to $5000 and 5 years in prison per infraction is possible.  If you count 
each file on a CD-ROM as an infraction, Mr. Davis could in theory be facing 
over a 100,000 years in jail and nearly a $100 million in fines - another 
contrast between technological reality and our legal system. From what we 
understand, in Oklahoma, it is technically illegal to actually BE naked at 
any time when not actually getting wet somehow, and some legal theorists 
posit that HBO and Showtime cable television channels are actually 
infractions under the state laws as written.

The future of Oklahoma Information Exchange BBS is unknown, and Davis himself 
was unable to comment on the arrest. Mid-America Digital Publishing, 1501 SE

 INTERNET NOTES

 ESOFT TO SHOW INTERNET CONNECTION AT ONE BBSCON
 -----------------------------------------------

eSoft, Inc. plans a demonstration of an inexpensive box they have tentatively 
titled a TBBS Internet Protocol Server (TIPS) that may hold one of the keys 
to connecting an electronic bulletin board system to the Internet for full IP 
services.

Increasingly, electronic bulletin boards across the country are now offering 
Internet mail and Usenet Newsgroups, but a few are also struggling to work 
through the puzzle of actually connecting their bulletin boards TO the 
Internet using the Internet Protocol and offering TCP/IP services such as 
telnet and ftp to their callers.  Additionally, many of these bulletin boards 
would like to be available to those on the Internet who may wish to access 
their BBSs by ftp or telnet - particularly those with a need for 
International connections which can be prohibitively expensive via direct 
dial.  Typically, this process is bit of a plumbing job involving terminal 
servers, routers, CSU/DSU units, none really designed for this job and often 
costing thousands of dollars.  A basic IP connection alone can run anywhere 
from $250 per month for a SLIP connection up to $1200-$1500 per month for a 
leased line and full IP connection.  The terminal servers, routers, etc. 
further drive up an up front cost of $7000-$15000.

Phil Becker, author of eSoft's TBBS bulletin board system, avows that IP and 
the connections required to make a BBS fully functional on the Internet are 
actually something less than rocket science, and can be done for a fraction 
of that cost. Since he was in fact one of the programming team members that 
put the Viking lander on Mars, he is actually qualified to make the 
comparison. And he's pieced together a "demonstration" project to illustrate 
that this isn't just a matter of opinion.  Using a very small PC costing less 
than $600, a modem, and a heavily modified version of Phil Karn's KA9Q 
software, he's built a small IP server for TBBS that does some pretty amazing 
things.

KA9Q itself is quite a piece of work.  It is a multi-tasking software system 
to connect a DOS machine to the Internet for telnet, ftp, ping, smtp mail, 
nntp newsgroups, etc.   And it can actually act as a router.  It is freely 
distributed and although originally authored by Phil Karn, it has had 
hundreds of modifications made by a number of individuals.  The result is at 
least 11 distinct versions of this program available for download online, 
each with varying capabilities.  The documentation is spartan to the point 
that the biggest challenge to KA9Q is getting it running.  But it does do a 
passable job of extending some pretty heavy duty TCP/IP functionality to a 
PC.  The primary drive to the origins of this program revolves around packet 
radio and the AX.25 protocol.  Hundreds of ham radio-based bulletin boards 
are connected via packet and TCP/IP, mostly using KA9Q (Phil Karn's call 
letters?)

Becker took one version of KA9Q apart, and rewrote many of the applications 
such as telnet, ftp, smtp mail, and a few others around the edges of it, and 
reconfigured it more or less as a terminal server specifically designed for 
bulletin boards.  He connects the IP server box running this heavily modified 
software to a TBBS system using null-modem serial cables, and his INTERCHANGE 
option module on the BBS provides access to these ports.  The IP server will 
automatically route telnet requests to the next available serial port, 
allowing telnet callers access to the BBS.  Additionally, Internauts can FTP 
to the BBS, which works a bit differently.  The IP server allows ftp access 
to file directories on the BBS itself via a LANtastic local area network.

BBS callers, conversely, can pick items off a TBBS menu to access the IP 
server to telnet or FTP OUT to other services.  In the case of telnet, this 
allows them to basically logon to any Internet service worldwide.  In the 
case of ftp, they can ftp a file which is transferred to the BBS drive, and 
from there they can download the file as they would any other.  The result is 
a system that allows TBBS callers access to the Internet, and Internet 
callers access to TBBS.

The IP server we saw demoed connected to the Internet using an ordinary 
14.4kbps modem via a Serial Line Internet Protocol (SLIP) account.  Using 
this pipe, the system can support up to about four simultaneous sessions. 
With more serial ports, more connections are possible, but probably not for 
anyone with a normal human attention span.

We were excited about this product for a couple of reasons.  For one thing, 
it replaces a LOT of hardware, software, and adapters with a pretty simple 
little PC with modem and software, to accomplish an IP connection many BBS 
operators have laid awake nights trying to piece through.   It does it in all 
cases for less than a $1000 total investment in hardware and software.  And 
it seems to work.  We telnetted into TBBS systems, out of TBBS systems, 
performed FTP sessions in both directions, and it all more or less hung 
together - which is approximately our experience with Internet as a whole.

Becker stresses that the TBBS Internet Protocol Server isn't a product - yet.  
With the KA9Q heritage, he's not certain he can sell it, or even give it away 
at this point.  Internally, they characterize the product as a "lab project" 
to prove the concept.  But he does assert that there is nothing mysterious 
about the Internet or KA9Q and that ultimately he believes that DOS-based 
bulletin boards will actually do a better job of providing services on the 
Internet than do the UNIX systems many Internauts commonly encounter.  
"Ultimately, I have to build this product," says Becker.  "The question is 
when."

But with the experience gained in puzzling through the demo system, he does 
have a pretty good idea how.  "In rewriting this task in assembly language 
from scratch, we believe we can service 16 serial ports from a relatively 
modest PC, and connect to the net through SLIP, a 56 KB leased line, ISDN, or 
even a T1 connection with little problem - AND perform routing functions 
aside from the BBS access." asserts Becker. "This just ISN'T that hard."

Meanwhile, eSoft plans on having the TBBS IP Server up and running at their 
booth at ONE BBSCON to allow show attendees to telnet or ftp into esoft.com, 
telnet or ftp out of it, and generally get over the "mystery" of connecting a 
BBS to the Internet.  We think ultimately a lot of bulletin boards, TBBS and 
others as well, will be using this "Becker Box" to make the connection.

 INTERNET FILE FORMATS - DELETE STAR DOT TAR
 -------------------------------------------

Each particular pond of the online world has its own set of conventions that 
seem overwhelming at first, and pretty basic once you know them.  The list of 
file transfer protocols and file formats on bulletin boards seems 
unnecessarily complex to new callers, and pretty simple to those that have 
become accustomed to dealing with .ZIP files, .ARC files, and .ARJ files.  
Once you get used to automatically picking ZMODEM off the protocol list, you 
hardly see the other protocols listed.

But throw a BBS user in Internet waters, and they do flounder a bit in a sea 
of .tar and .z files, and dealing with directory names longer than their 
neckties.  But it really isn't a lot different.

Many who find a way onto the Internet naturally enough begin to learn about 
various treasure troves of files.  Often, file collections specializing in 
MS-DOS programs will already be compressed in the familiar .ZIP file format.  
But for text files, descriptions, and source code most at home in a UNIX 
world, some slightly different file formats are quite common.

In general, the UNIX world does separate the archiving function that combines 
multiple related files into a single entity, and the compression function, 
which reduces the total file size.

Archiving is most often done using a file extension .tar or .TAR.  This 
stands for Tape ARchive and naturally enough it was originally developed to 
store directories off of disk onto 9-track tape.  These files can contain 
both files and directories, and it generally includes the subdirectory 
structure needed to restore the files.

.TAR files can be extracted on a DOS machine using several programs.  But 
there is a bit of a problem.  UNIX file names can be multipart and quite long 
as in a.really.long.MixED.CAse.UNIX.file_name.  They can also be mixed case 
with upper and lower case letters.  So simply extracting TAR files onto a DOS 
machine also requires some form of filename translation, usually referred to 
for no particular reason we can devine as file "munging".

One program that handles .TAR extractions pretty well is ExTAR.  ExTAR was 
written by a German named Gisbert W. Selke and distributed as free software 
in the file EXTAR10.ZIP.  It was written in Turbo Pascal and we've been 
unable to locate a version past the original 1.0.  I wish I could write a 1.0 
of something that worked, but Mr. Selke seems to have handled it.

Another basic port of the TAR program for DOS was done by Mark Colburn of The 
USENIX Association in St. Paul Minnesota.  Mr. Colburn wrote TAR4DOS.ZIP.

Both these utilities are available by file transfer protocol (ftp) from 
ftp.uu.net in the subdirectory ystems/ibmpc/msdos/simtel20/filutl.

The compression function most common on the Internet is referred to, 
appropriately enough, as COMPRESS.  This is a compression program similar to 
PKZIP in that it uses Lempel-Ziv coding to compress data - though generally 
not with as good a compression factor as we are accustomed to on bulletin 
boards.  COMPRESS files are generally, but not always, noted with the file 
extension .Z.  Further, the tape archive and compression processes can, and 
often are combined to form files like filename.tar.z.  You would want to 
perform the processes from right to left to get the original file.  
Uncompress the .z, and then extract the .tar.

We also found a couple of passable DOS utilities for uncompressing.  Probably 
the standard workhorse is COMPRESS version 4.3c available in the file 
COMP430D.ZIP.  Like much of the software in the Unix community, this is free 
of charge and the source code is available in the file COMP430S.ZIP.  
Generally, you would use the syntax compress -d filename to decompress a 
particular file.  As best we can tell, the first release of this program was 
in July of 1984, it's had as many as eight official authors, and the 4.3c 
release was in January of 1990.  This one has made the route.

An interesting relative newcomer is a program titled GZIP.  Written by 
Frenchman Jean-loup Gailly, GZIP is also freely distributed with source code 
in the file GZIP123.ZIP.  GZIP is interesting in that it actually 
automatically detects and decompresses several file formats, including 
COMPRESS, ZIP version 1.9, and it's own .GZ format.  While compress .Z files 
are still the most ubiquitous, .GZ actually is much improved with regards to 
the resulting data size.

Both GZIP123.ZIP and COMP430D.ZIP are available by ftp in the directory 
/wuarchive/systems/ibmpc/msdos at the ftp site knot.queensu.ca.

We have put up a small Internet support files file area on the Boardwatch BBS 
with uuencode/decode, a few specific RFCs, and these .tar and .z extractors 
for those who have difficulty ftping about the Internet.

 PBS ONLINE
 ----------
 by Bill Gram-Reefer

This past Spring, the Public Broadcasting System (PBS) circulated a Request 
for Information (RFI) to a wide variety of software developers and 
communications consultants involved in the telecommunications field. The 
purpose of the RFI was to get as much feedback as possible on how PBS could 
fulfill its new mission of launching a bulletin board system (BBS) that will 
eventually link 196 PBS stations via satellite and allow for local 
member-users to access local PBS nodes using modems and telephone lines. As a 
lesson in state-of-the-art proposal writing for a BBS, to help you plan, 
pitch, and fund a BBS for your own home, business, school, or non-profit, 
this document takes the cake with over 40-dense pages, including appendices, 
glossary, and bibliography. There's even a video on how the proposal was 
made, so now you really know where all of your pledge-night dollars have been 
going!

While a commendable project for PBS in itself, the document, as a vision of 
what a BBS should look like, and what kind of features it should have, 
powerfully illustrates the current, highly-evolved state of BBSing in terms 
of technology, user ergonomics, networking capabilities, and slam-dunk 
usefulness as a meaningful communications tool for businesses. BBSing is just 
not for hobbyists, anymore. Consequently, like it or not, the proposal also 
acknowledges many new standards concerning what hot, new, and public BBSing 
should require, including true cross-platform support, and graphical user 
interface (GUI) that, with the introduction of the Mac-based GUI systems now 
supporting Windows, have become must-have items to accommodate new users 
unfamiliar with kludgy, unintuitive, command-line frustration traps offered 
by other outmoded BBS systems.

Content for PBS Online will vary from station to station, but generally, each 
node would provide access to the following selection including but not 
limited to: PBS Online instructions, tutorials, and manuals; PBS programming 
schedule, transcripts, and classroom support materials; Linknet Learning 
Link, K12 USENET news groups, FidoNet K12 file libraries and conferences, 
KIDSNET and EDUCOM files relevant to K12 schools; ERIC and other educational 
resources, the Project Gutenberg archives, congressional contact information, 
and public domain software and file libraries.

Here are some system requirement highlights from the proposal:

1. Network requirementsuusing TCP/IP as its primary networking protocol, 
provide gateways to Internet and offer an Internet sub-addressing scheme for 
member stations; add potential e-mail connections to FidoNet, FrEdMail, 
OneNet, CNN News, Clarisnet, and USA Today; automated address translation, 
network management and control, content screening including virus protection, 
copyright enforcement, and obscenity screening; and the ability to act as a 
bulletin board clearing house service for disseminating articles and general 
files.

2. Server specificationsuin addition to supporting a command-line user 
interface, the system requires a graphical user interface as well, using 
client-based application software supporting Windows and Macintosh. Auto 
registration, time limits, search tools, file transfer tools including 
ZMODEM, and online help round out the feature wish list. Additional 
consideration is given to extendibility to include access or "doorways" to 
other applications including Wide Area Information Service (WAIS). 
Furthermore, the electronic mail function will include a text processor and 
attachment capability for file transfers. A hierarchical data structure will 
incorporate folders. Users shall also enjoy real threading, private mailing 
lists, forms, and moderated conferences.

System Administration should be remote capable by calling in with the client 
software to administer groups of users assigned with certain levels of 
privileges and access to various folders, as well as have links to 
conferences for cleaning up after a telethon. Real-time server monitoring is 
also an item mentioned, as in forced logoffs and server logs with full 
reporting with an array of user stats. Interestingly, mention of inter-node 
messaging and chat room capabilities were not found in the proposal, so 
there'll be no "type-along Messiah" during pledge night.

3. Client specificationsu At minimum, RS232 asynchronous connections and 
TCP/IP via Ethernet; hopefully include support for connections via AppleTalk, 
IPX, Netbios, or X.25. One or more active file transfers while also reading 
files is cited as a must-have feature, along with platform specific 
multitasking, previewing, user scripting, and platform specific off-line mail 
and conference readers. The graphical user interface should include 
overlapping, scrollable, and resizeable windows, mouse support, icons, 
pull-down and pop-up menus, and dialog boxes, although, on the Mac side, 
there is no mention of AppleEvents compatibility or true drag-and-drop 
functionality for the icons other than graphic representations of folders.

According to a knowledgeable professional familiar with the project, expect 
this RFI process to take about a year to filter through to reality. More so, 
when you look at the shopping list, you realize pretty quickly that some of 
what PBS wants in one package just hasn't been shipped yet and it might 
become a matter of hot wiring a version of NovaLink with a substantial 
customized feature set that could take a year to implement soundly. But the 
end product, even if it incorporates only 80% of the initial specifications, 
will still prove to be ahead of the pack; something like a cross between 
FirstClass and MacIntercomm, but with a functional off-line reader, one might 
imagine; combined with the administrative power of a Wildcat, for instance.

Whatever the outcome, though, this proposal has certainly pushed the envelope 
for higher standards within the BBS software community. In effect, the 
proposal legitimizes several areas, particularly cross platform support for 
Internet connectivity, and GUI-based, point-and-click ease-of-use via 
client-based user interface programs as forwarded by the newer Mac BBS 
programs. More importantly, the PBS proposal will stand as a critical link in 
the evolving picture of how Americans will access public, distributed 
networks. Should such a venture come from the schools, freenets, quasi-public 
orgs such as PBS or Red Cross? Or, will we still need local, independent 
freenets in each burg? PBS, 1320 Braddock Place Alexandria, VA 22314; (703)

 TBBS SYSTEM DESIGNER
 --------------------
 by David Hakala

PC Information Group Inc. has released its long-awaited Menu Conversion 
Utility, a suite of programs which convert existing TBBS menu control files 
(MENU????.CTL) into the formats used by the company's System Designer 
application generator.  Provided at no cost, the utility eliminates hours of 
work formerly required to upgrade an existing TBBS system to the System 
Designer programming environment.

The Menu Conversion Utility reads existing menu control files and generates 
System Designer Project (PRJ), Library (LIB), and User Access (ACC) files.  
These files contain all of the screen information and control settings 
specified in the original *.CTL files, in System Designer's object-oriented 
format.  The conversion process can simultaneously generate any desired 
combination of three versions of each menu:  color ANSI/IBM graphics, 
black-and-white graphics-only, or ASCII text-only.

In test runs, the conversion utility performed quickly and flawlessly on an 
80386/33Mhz PC, taking about two to three seconds to convert each menu of a 
representative TBBS system.  Minor manual adjustments, such as giving 
mnemonic names to User Access Level database records, were highlighted by the 
utility itself and swiftly accomplished.

The conversion process is also a learning experience, even for an experienced 
TBBS developer.  The SDL code generated from the resulting System Designer 
files was noticeably more readable than the piecemeal original, and the new 
MENU????.CTL files precisely duplicated the functionality of the originals u 
only more efficiently than the original design.

SYSTEM DESIGNER PUTS FUN BACK IN BBS DESIGN

System Designer, a $149 Computer-Aided Software Engineering (CASE) tool, 
makes eSoft Inc.'s powerful butdaunting TBBS bulletin board system software 
accessible to novices and a dream come true for expert TBBS developers.  No 
matter what your level of expertise, System Designer will help you design a 
better BBS in record time, and have fun doing it.

Like BBSing itself, System Designer is hard to explain to the uninitiated.  
Those who have not tried the program may think it is "just another drawing 
utility" like The Draw, or at best a TBBS-specific menu painter like ProMenu, 
that generates ANSI/graphics, graphics-only, and text-only menus from a 
single template.  System Designer does menus, but it also does a whole lot 
more.

OVERVIEW:  ALL YOU NEED IN ONE PROGRAM

System Designer integrates menu design, SDL source code generation, user 
access control, macro maintenance, menu control file compilation, even live 
TBBS test runs, in an elegant, mouse-driven programming environment. BBS 
developers no longer need to learn a text editor and an ANSI drawing program 
in addition to learning the components of TBBS.  You can also throw away your 
cheat-sheets of SDL macro definitions, security flag and privilege level 
settings.  System Designer does it all under one roof, and keeps house for 
you.

A customizable batch file can be run from the System Designer Compile menu to 
compile the generated SDL source code using TBBS' SDL.COM.  If errors are 
found in the source code, a source listing including SDL-generated error 
messages is displayed.  If no errors are found, the batch file runs TBBS so 
you can see how the system works online.

PROJECT MANAGEMENT FEATURES

Consultants who design BBSes for multiple clients and sysops who maintain a 
number of subsystems on their BBSes will appreciate System Designer's Project 
Manager module.  It makes selecting and working on any project or subsystem 
as easy as point-and-click, keeps track of which menus in any BBS project 
have been compiled, and lets you specify which menus should be compiled and 
tested during the current session.

MENU PIRATING & TREE DISPLAYS

System Designer makes it easy to track and re-use all the bits and pieces of 
every BBS you have ever designed u or ever seen.  Portions of previously 
designed BBSes can be copied and modified for use in new projects.  A TSR 
utility called SAVER.COM captures any DOS text-based screen and saves it as a 
binary file that System Designer can import.  If you loved that opening 
screen on The Hot Muddy Duck BBS, you can load it into System Designer and 
edit it to suit you.  (This feature is sure to set off minor copyright 
infringement wars among sysops, but that's what keeps BBSing interesting.)

System Designer includes a menu-tree function that will show you at a 
keystroke what each option on a menu does and where GOTO or GOSUB commands 
lead.  Does "<G>oodbye" log the user off immediately (command type 10) or 
take him to a final menu (command type 5)?  The menu tree will show you.

DESIGNING A BBS WITH SYSTEM DESIGNER

Creating a new BBS starts with making a Project File, a control file which 
maintains a list of all menus, their definitions, access control settings, 
and other information about the new BBS.  Each BBS menu is defined on a 
screen that asks for the menu's four-character MENU????.CTL file name, a more 
meaningful description stored in the Project File, i. e., "Hackers Forum File 
Menu," and optionally a Billing Class for the menu.

The rest of the Menu Definition Screen consists of checkboxes and radio 
buttons.  First, you specify which version(s) of the menu to create as SDL 
source code:  ANSI, black-and-white graphics-only, and/or ASCII text-only.  
Second, decide whether to clear the caller's screen before displaying this 
menu.  You would not clear the screen if this menu were an overlay on an 
existing menu, as in a pulldown menu application.  Third, set the background 
color to use when the screen is cleared, by clicking on a color bar.

The "Complex menus" option enables creation of menu entries larger than SDL's 
normal limit of 4096 characters.  TBBS v2.2 includes a new ENTRY: command 
that loads and displays external menu display codes on demand.  Setting 
System Designer's "Complex" menu definition option lets you take advantage of 
the ENTRY: feature by storing complex menus in external files instead of 
compiling them as SDL code.

BUILDING MENUS FROM OBJECTS

After defining a menu, you find yourself staring at a blank screen set to the 
background color previously defined.  This challenge to your creativity is 
where the real fun of using System Designer begins.

Use the mouse to mark a rectangular block on the screen; such marked blocks 
form the "objects" of which all System Designer menus are composed.  An 
object can be a whole menu, one line of text on the menu, a single character, 
or any other piece you might want to move, define as an SDL menu entry, or 
re-color.

A pulldown Block Manipulation Menu lets you draw a box to define the 
boundaries of the menu, using effects such as single- or double line 
boundaries, and shadows that provide "depth" to a menu display.  Shadows can 
be "transparent:"  if they fall on existing text, the underlying text will 
still be visible in grey-on-black colors - a nice effect.  Custom shadows 
composed of any graphics character can also be created; they will obliterate 
underlying text.  You can also draw freehand using single or double lines, or 
any printable ASCII character you wish.

Adding text to a menu is a matter of positioning the cursor in an object and 
typing away.  Text can be centered within the object's left/right borders 
with a single keystroke.  System Designer includes a database of TBBS v2.2 
insertion parameters, making it easy to insert these system variables in any 
menu.

OBJECTS MAKE BETTER BBSES

The ease with which you can move objects and blocks encourages good menu 
design; "good enough" just isn't good enough when perfection takes so little 
effort.  Any rectangular portion of a menu can be highlighted and moved to a 
new location.  Predefined objects can be selected by simply double-clicking 
on them.  You can drop a block or an object anywhere on the screen, but 
System Designer will warn you if you are about to obliterate an underlying 
object.

AMAZING ANSI CONTROL

The minute and easy control System Designer gives you over 
foreground/background colors and the attributes of every object is one of 
this program's greatest strengths.  Just highlight a block, select Block 
Attribute from a pulldown menu, and you can pick any combination of colors 
and intensity from a matrix while viewing a sample of the result.  A press of 
a key can make a block blink.

If you don't like the new color scheme, it is easily changed.  Let's say most 
of the text on your menu is white-on-blue, but you made the menu keys bright 
green and that now looks awful.  Just highlight the portion of the menu that 
contains bright green foregrounds, select Foreground Attribute, specify the 
old foreground color (bright green) and then choose a new foreground color.  
Only the bright green foreground colors will be changed!  Background colors 
are just as easily and selectively modified.

You can also precisely set the position of the ANSI cursor by row and column, 
useful when designing animated ANSI screens and other applications where the 
cursor must "jump" to a new screen position.  You can also set the cursor's 
colors and make it blink.

ADDING FUNCTION TO MENUS

You must add TBBS commands to each menu if you want it to do something when a 
user presses a key.  System Designer keeps this process easy and well 
organized.

Just create a separate object for each menu option, i. e., "Upload," 
"Download," "Read Messages," and so on.  System Designer lets you specify an 
activating menu key, TBBS command type, and any optional data (Opt Data) for 
the command.  System Designer maintains convenient popup lists of available 
menu names, message boards, and conferences, so you do not have to remember 
all of those cryptic names when specifying Opt Data.

ACCESS CONTROL LIBRARY

Security flags and privilege levels comprise a user's access profile, which 
determines which menu lines will appear to a given user and how each menu key 
will function for him.  Keeping track of different access profiles is a 
never-ending struggle for most sysops.  System Designer lets you assign 
meaningful names and descriptions to all of the different flag/privilege 
combinations used on your BBS, and choose the appropriate access profile for 
a menu entry from a scrollable picklist.

AUTOMATED CODE GENERATION

The heart of System Designer is a unique module that generates flawless, 
well-structured SDL code from the menus you design.  You can specify whether 
to generate SDL code for all menus, only for menus that have changed since 
code was last generated, or only for a specific menu.

The Code Generator module writes SDL code the way it was meant to be written 
u the hard way, but the most efficient way for online display.  ANSI screens, 
for example, are best written using one SDL menu entry per screen line, like 
this:

ENTRY:
[14;2H[45mThis is a [1m[33mFRAME Object[1m[37m.[40m
ANS=-

Few BBS designers do things this way; it's just too tedious and error-prone.  
But Code Generator automatically does it for you.  The results include 
smoother and faster menu displays, faster returns from menu function calls 
(Read Messages, Display a text file, and so on), and fewer disk drive 
accesses.

This code generation method, combined with other System Designer features, 
let the sysop precisely determine which menu items will be displayed first.  
For example, some sysops like to paint boxes, then fill in text; others want 
the user to see the text first while the box is being drawn.  System Designer 
lets you easily determine the order in which menu objects will be displayed.  
If you want line 3 of a menu displayed before lines 1 and 2, no problem.

Once SDL code is generated for all menus, a list of any code generation error 
messages is displayed at the top of the screen, along with a picklist of 
three action options:  Return to Project Manager; Execute BATCH.BAT (the SDL 
menu compiler/TBBS test-drive routine); or Exit to DOS.

PRODUCTIVITY GAINS

Sysops accustomed to the normal way of designing TBBS systems find it hard to 
believe what System Designer can do for their productivity.  But your author 
designed in two 8-hour days a BBS which includes eight separate subsystems, 
with a total of 88 different menus (ANSI, graphics-only, and text-only 
versions of each menu), and 40 distinct access profiles.

That project would have taken over a week without System Designer.  The ANSI 
menus would not be as pleasing, and half of the extra time would have been 
spent debugging minor typographical errors.  Instead, the human designer was 
able to concentrate on the appearance and functionality of the BBS from a 
user's perspective, and leave the machine-level details to System Designer.  
Building a BBS became a more creative, fun occupation, and less of a 
nitpicking chore.


FIRST-CLASS PRODUCT SUPPORT

PC Information Group backs System Designer with the kind of support 
professional sysops expect.  There is a BBS where you can test-drive and 
download several examples of BBS menu sets built with System Designer, confer 
with tech support and other TBBS designers, download upgrades and utility 
files.  The program's documentation is bound, typeset and well illustrated.  
Technical support is provided by experienced TBBS designers from 9:00 a.m. to 
5:00 p.m. CST Monday through Friday.

System Designer is a whole new way of designing bulletin board systems u the 
best way currently available, in your author's opinion.  If you run or plan 
to run a TBBS system, "You just gotta get this thing!" (Sorry, Prodigy.)

 UPDATE ON GENIE
 ---------------
 by Donn King

First, some updates on information: just as we went to press for the August 
issue, GEnie made some changes to its software. Two of the items mentioned in 
that column thus need updating.

1) PCAladdin is now in version 1.70, and older versions will no longer be 
supported. In a press release, PCAladdin sysops said, "Although the primary 
reason for this change to Aladdin is to work properly with GEnie's new rate 
structure, we have taken this opportunity to add in a number of 
frequently-requested features, including additional script commands."

To obtain the new version of Aladdin, you may either enter M110;4 at a 
numbered GEnie page prompt, or you may download it from the PC Aladdin 
Support RoundTable software library (enter M110;3) as ALAD170.EXE. Normal 
GEnie connect time charges will apply.

2) The C command that would take you back and forth between using menus and 
using a kind of "expert" mode that only showed you page prompts has been 
dropped. If you are going to use Aladdin, or just want to use the expert 
mode, you need to enter the keyword SET at a numbered GEnie page prompt, then 
step through the menu items. Remember that whenever you go to an unfamiliar 
page and need to see the menu momentarily, entering a question mark (?) will 
bring it up.

Internet mail update

I made online friends with Alan Seaver a few months back. He was about to 
leave the Internet though, because he was leaving his school and had no other 
access. I told him about GEnie's rate changes, which would make it one of the 
most inexpensive and accessible services for getting Internet e-mail.

A couple of things limited GEnie for Internet, though. You can only use it 
for e-mail; ftp and telnet are unavailable. As Alan said, though, it had been 
months since he used either of the latter. The biggest irritant was the limit 
on the address field; you could include no more than 35 characters, which 
effectively prevented participation in many usenet groups and correspondence 
with long-named schools. I couldn't send through GEnie to my own main 
address, the one which used to end these articles!

Although the ftp and telnet situation has not changed, Internet RT sysop Andy 
Finkenstadt said, "The 35-character limit that would prevent some messages 
from going out has been eliminated as of July 15, 1993. So now an address to 
a Fidonet node, or to some long mailing list addresses, will work just fine.  
Some routing problems were fixed as well with the America Online service.  
Mail to people @AOL.COM now works."

Maybe I'll see Alan around GEnie now.

VR RT becomes reality

Actually, it's the Multimedia, Desktop Video and Virtual Reality RoundTable 
(they call it Multimedia RT for short).

Co-managed by Denny Atkin, COMPUTE Magazine's Interactive Entertainment 
editor, and Peggy Herrington, freelance editor/writer and founder of the 
industry's first multimedia disk-based magazine, the RoundTable is scheduled 
to open in early September.

Herrington told me they have planned in October Real-Time Conferences with 
Lou Wallace addressing desktop video, Howard Rheingold on virtual reality, 
and J. Micheal Straczynski on graphics production for the "Babylon 5" TV 
series.

They also plan an extensive software library of downloadable commercial 
multimedia program demonstrations and sample projects, plus graphics, audio 
and information files for IBM-compatible, Macintosh and Amiga, and product 
support by hardware and software manufacturers.

"Commercial VR endeavors include shopping mall projects such as the 
franchised parlor chains, Virtuality, and Paramount's aStar Trek: The Next 
Generation,'" Herrington said. "The Multimedia RoundTable will address 
developments in the VR arena, providing current, in-depth information for 
people interested in this emerging technology."

RTs sprout

The opening of several new RoundTables followed in the wake of GEnie's rate 
changes in July (see the August issue for a run-down of the new rates. 
Briefly, at 2400 baud, GEnie costs $3.00 per hour between 6 p.m. and 8 a.m. 
local time, with four hours included in its basic monthly fee of $8.95). They 
include both general interest and product support RTs. They include:

* The Europe RoundTableuadvertising for it says, "We will cover all countries 
in Europe. If we haven't started a topic on your favorite European country 
let us know and we will start one for you." The Europe RT is part of the 
Germany & Europe RT; European categories begin in Category 25. Enter M725 or 
keyword EUROPE or GERMANY.

* The SCA RoundTable, which supports the worldwide activity of the Society 
for Creative Anachronism, a group of nearly 25,000 members dedicated to the 
study and selective re-creation of aspects of pre-17th century cultures. The 
Bulletin Board includes categories for each of the SCA's 13 "Kingdoms" 
(regional-level groups), plus Arts and Sciences, Heraldry, Fighting, Bardic 
Arts, Offices, Events, a Revel for socializing, and other support topics. 
They also have an online version of SCA combat. You don't have to be a member 
of SCA to participate or play. Enter M1425 or keyword SCA.

* The OS/2 RoundTable, which provides support for IBM's controversial 
operating system. Sysops say, "Recent updates of OS/2 make it easier to use 
and more powerful."

The RoundTable offers technical support for OS/2 itself as well as 
applications; the software library has utilities, shareware and public domain 
products for use with OS/2.

Featured RT: Homeschoolers in the Education RoundTable

We're going to start featuring a RoundTable each month to help you get to 
know the people on GEnie. This month we consider the ERT.

The Education RoundTable provides an online home for professional educators, 
parents with school-age children, commercial trainers, and homeschoolers. 
Bobbi Pournelle is the "principal"uthe sysop of the ERT.

Bobbi has been with the ERT since coming to GEnie in 1987. She is married to 
Jerry Pournelle, a well-known science fiction and nonfiction writer who also 
has the distinction of heading the only GEnie RoundTable centered around an 
individual, the Jerry Pournelle RoundTable. The Pournelle family thus finds 
GEnie a major part of their lives.

"I came to GEnie at the invitation of Neil Harris (who left GEnie recently," 
she said. They had known each other professionally for years and were on BIX 
together. "He suggested that GEnie would reach a totally different audience 
and that my contact would be wider with more students, more teachers and 
certainly more parents. My desire was to encourage the Learning Triangle to 
communicate. I always thought of the triangle as parents, student and school 
folks. Things took an interesting turn with the addition of the 
HomeSchoolers."

Although homeschoolers gather on other electronic services, their reception 
among professional educators vary. Some see homeschoolers as a threat to 
either their principles or their livelihood, but on GEnie "Our teachers are 
secure enough that they seem to like the interchange and don't feel 
threatened by these dedicated parents. We all learn from each other."

Homeschoolers have a variety of reasons for their educational choices. The 
popular conception of homeschoolers centers around religious "fanatics." Many 
of the homeschoolers on GEnie homeschool for religious reasons, but hardly 
strike you as fanatic.

For instance, Rich Shalvoy said, "We are homeschoolers of the Christian 
variety, having just finished our third year. GEnie offers networking with 
like- and dissimilar-minded parent-educators. There is the chance to help 
share ideas with others and to learn from them.

"There is the community aspect, too," he added. "Many homeschooling parents 
are good, caring people who are also intelligent and usually are not afraid 
to express an opinionuthe kind of people you'd like to have as friends if 
they happened to be in your neighborhood. Through the wide reach of GEnie, 
this now becomes possible."

Al Sutherland said, "The two main things I get from GEnie are the ERT and 
Grolier's Encyclopedia. The ERT gives you fast responses if you have a 
problem or question you need help with. This is also almost my only contact 
with other homeschoolers."

Homeschoolers from Hawaii to Florida to New England gather to compare notes 
on curricula, suppliers, and teaching tips in Categories 8 and 9, overseen by 
Topic Cop Anne Wasserman. Twice monthly Real-Time Conferences provide 
real-time contact, and participation will likely go up with the lower 
per-hour rates.

When I first got to know the homeschoolers in late 1991, Beverly Marshall 
told me, "I never would have attempted homeschooling until the Education 
RoundTable showed me I could. A year ago I didn't know anyone who did this, 
and now I know a lot of wonderful people."

Other homeschoolers do so primarily for educational reasons. Oak Ridge, 
Tennessee, has one of the best public school systems in the nation; it also 
has one of the largest concentration of homeschooling populations in the 
state. David Olive and Jacki Willard homeschool their son, James, because 
they believe it is educationally superior to methods that collect 30 or so 
children into one room and attempt to teach all of them the same thing at the 
same time. James has also been diagnosed with Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity 
Disorder. Several homeschoolers on GEnie have similar circumstances; their 
children do much better educationally at home. In fact, a study conducted by 
the Tennessee Department of Education showed homeschoolers across the state 
scoring in the 80th percentile on standardized tests, significantly higher 
than the 50th percentile of the average public school student.

The most accurate generalization about homeschoolers is that they homeschool 
for a huge variety of reasons; each family generally has more than one 
reason. "Our kids are still young yet, but we are planning to keep them 
home," said MacBeth Derham. "We are homeschooling for political and religious 
reasons (Catholic), and because I work for a consortium of school districts 
and have seen horrible things done to kids' self esteem in the name of 
education. I first found out about homeschooling CI$ (Compuserve). Someone 
there said that GEnie had a wonderfully active homeschooling group, so I 
checked it out and here we are!

"Right now, GEnie is a way for us to network and find out what different 
methods, materials and resources are available to us," she continued. "The 
support from others who have made the same choices is invaluable. With GEnie 
we can make connections that are impossible even within local support 
groups...and we can do it in our pajamas! My house doesn't have to be clean, 
yet you can all come over and talk. I can visit without getting into a car, 
or finding a sitter. These things (and Aladdin), make GEnie a great online 
value for our family."

Not all homeschoolers agreed about the value part. When the rates changed on 
July 1, a dozen or so explicitly departed the service; it is difficult to 
tell how many others may have done so. Many of them had noted for a long time 
that they could only afford to come online because of GEnie's $4.95 a month 
flat rate, since bulletin board under the old scheme were free. You could 
count a couple of hundred posters, and attendance in categories (prior to 
GEnie disabling the command that showed this) showed a couple of thousand, 
yet fewer than half a dozen would show up for the average Real-Time 
Conference. Homeschoolers were among the 15 percent whose actual charges were 
expected to go up under the new pricing.

Still, many of the old regulars stayed around; many of them say their 
personal charges are lower, and that they can find no better place for 
networking (some of them joined other services while considering leaving 
GEnie; many of them report homeschool groups on other services to be not 
nearly so active or welcomed within the education areas).

"Perhaps GEnie is the forerunner of how home-centered schooling and community 
centered schooling will operate in the future," said Bobbi Pournelle. 
"Through the electronic nets the roads of learning merge and hopefully 
politicians will begin to pay more attention to what is happening and how 
folks are willing to accommodate to the needs of the family with learners - 
ALL!"

Pournelle sees the homeschoolers as an integral part of a RoundTable 
dedicated to education in all its forms. "The best thing about running the 
ERT over the years has been meeting [interesting] folks. The GEnie folks are 
brighter than the average bear and wish to become better informed and are 
most willing to share with others. We try to create light while sometimes 
creating heat. Things on GEnie run in cycles which reflects what is happening 
aon the street.' The latest issues and concerns such as vouchers, 
standardized testing, educational spending and policies are aired here.

"Another joy has been meeting so many bright kids. Watching their growth in 
self-expression has been great. This reflects upon their self-esteem and 
growth in using the technology to enrich their lives. When the teachers are 
exchanging innovative and successful teaching techniques such as aMath in the 
Cemetery, and the kids are talking about writing their essays for college 
applications and parents are debating how to ensure that they have covered 
all bases for finding the ideal nursery school for their cubs I am the 
happiest."

 NOVALINK PROFESSIONAL 3.0: THE REVIEW
 -------------------------------------
 by Chris Holmes

I have run a BBS for almost 10 years.  When I started, it was with Networks 
II on a 64K Apple II+. At that time, Networks II was considered "state of the 
art" and offered "modern" features such as private e-mail, Sysop chatting, 
and a public message area. Since then, communications have come along way and 
I have used many different BBS packages.

My system took the biggest step when I upgraded to a new software package 
from ResNova Software Inc., NovaLink Professional 3.0 for the Macintosh. What 
this software offers for a system operator is unequaled in the desktop 
BBS/Server industry: graphic user interface, sophisticated message editing 
features, a powerful user scripting language, networking, plus compatibility 
with hundreds of existing "externals" (also known as "plug-ins," or "doors" 
to our DOS friends).

Let's start from the top. The major feature of NovaLink is its versatile 
graphic user interface (GUI). ResNova's GUI allows users to access online 
information through simple icons, sounds, and pictures, instead of navigating 
through many levels of text based menus. Using the GUI also provides for 
multiple typefaces, sizes, and styles of text to be used within messages. 
And, unlike most graphical software packages available which are very rigid 
in their interface style (the Sysop cannot modify the "look & feel"), 
NovaLink is very flexible. A small application, dubbed "NovaMondrian" permits 
the BBS operator to build his or her own interface (icons, buttons, and all) 
from the ground up. Because of this, each NovaLink system can have a truly 
unique look. If an operator does not wish to put effort into a unique 
interface, the administrator can employ the built-in "NovaView" system. 
NovaView automatically creates a Finder-like environment for the BBS. The 
user will see message forums and file areas as folders, and other functions 
as icons. The operator merely sets up the file areas and message forums, 
NovaView does the rest.

To access NovaLink in GUI mode, a user must dial in with a special terminal 
software package called "NovaTerm," which is available for both Mac and 
MS-DOS systems with support for RIP graphics. NovaTerm incorporates a special 
protocol that ensures an error-free connection even when not using a V.42 or 
MNP type modem. Another benefit of this protocol is simultaneous uploads and 
downloads, even while reading messages, sending mail, and using other 
functions of the BBS. If you have more than one file queued for transfer in 
either direction, a queue list will allow you to view the status of each file 
(similar to the Macintosh PrintMonitor which allows you to view the status of 
each print job waiting in a printer queue). To save on long distance fees, a 
simple off-line message creation feature lets users compose letters before 
they actually connect. NovaTerm comes in three flavors: Regular (for modem 
connections), Network (for network connections), and PPC (for local computer 
logons). NovaTerm also allows the user to choose which interface is actually 
seen when calling the BBS: the custom interface (if the Sysop has created 
one), or the NovaView interface.

If users do not have NovaTerm, they can log on to NovaLink with any regular 
terminal program. One of the strengths of NovaLink Professional, along with 
its GUI, is its completely customizable text interface. Each text screen can 
be independently composed, utilizing the full ANSI character set if needed. 
Using NovaLink's scripting ability, different menus can even be displayed to 
users with different emulations. A graphic imaging model named "RipScript" 
has also been developed by ResNova. RipScript allows callers with 
non-graphical systems (such as DOS machines not running under Windows) to get 
the same GUI point & click functionality common to graphics based operating 
systems while still using their favorite telecommunications software.

The messaging and text editing features of NovaLink are among the best found 
online. In the GUI mode, a user writing a new message is presented with a 
window similar to that of MS Word. The top portion of the window is a toolbar 
which contains many useful features such as font selection, text 
justification, and font style. Files can be attached to messages simply by 
clicking on the "attach" button. The bottom portion contains the text editing 
window. Here, all the standard Macintosh text editing functions apply.

Message forums are especially powerful. Using a technique called threading, 
NovaLink Professional organizes messages by topic. Although other BBSs claim 
to "thread" messages, NovaLink does this in a way that makes sense. When a 
message is posted with a new topic, a new folder is started. All replies to 
this message are stored within that folder; new topics start a new thread. 
Using the GUI, this is exactly how it appears; a message forum is like a list 
of folders, each folder being a thread.

NovaLink also comes stock with a powerful scripting language, NovaScript, 
which allows the operator to easily add functions to the BBS that are not 
normally present. NovaScript is easy even for the "un-programmer" to 
understand. It reads like English and is quite similar in structure to 
HyperTalk. Using this scripting ability, such items as online quizzes can be 
created with a minimal expenditure of time.

One of the most impressive features of NovaLink is its suite of networking 
capabilities. Each NovaLink package comes with a proprietary network exchange 
protocol built-in. This protocol allows for NovaLink to NovaLink exchanges of 
private mail, files, and public message forums. A ResNova sponsored network, 
InfoLink, is available for any NovaLink sysop to hook into. As an option, 
ResNova will offer NovaLink with an InterNet gateway. This gateway will allow 
any NovaLink BBS complete access to all UseNet message feeds and InterNet 
mail.

Another exciting feature of NovaLink is its ability to use "externals." 
Externals are programs that add functionality to any NovaLink BBS. These 
externals can range from online games to user maintenance utilities. And, 
because NovaLink Pro 3.0 has evolved over some years (the first incarnation 
of NovaLink was originally written by a high school student), there is 
already a large base of externals available for use.

Setting up a NovaLink system is easy. Each BBS starts out as a blank "page". 
The operator selects functions from a toolbar and drags them to the page. 
Double clicking the icons allows for operational parameters to be set (i.e.: 
in the case of a message forum, the message expiration date can be set). In 
the case of a folder icon, a new "page" (which appears as a new window to the 
user) is opened. This folder can contain file areas, messages, externals, or 
any other function. Continuing on in this fashion results in a unique system, 
in only  a few minutes. To create the customized interface, run 
"NovaMondrian" and build an interface for each page (window) of the BBS.

Administering the system is just as easy. All message forum and file area 
data are kept within any folder on the hard drive that the operator 
specifies. Thus, files and messages can reside on several different drives. 
Any mounted volume on the Mac's desktop can be used. As an added benefit, 
messages are stored in a single random access file. This is useful especially 
for BBSs with active forums u you don't end up with thousands of tiny files 
wasting precious space all over your hard drive.  Within file areas, files 
are stored on the disk in their native format. As a Sysop, you can access the 
file directly from your hard drive u- you don't have to logon to your own BBS 
to download it. To add files to the BBS, just drag them into the 
corresponding folder on the hard drive. The BBS file list is automatically 
updated!

An area that could use improvement on NovaLink Professional is NovaMondrian, 
the custom interface builder. In its current form, NovaMondrian creates small 
data files that must be imported into the NovaLink server application before 
a custom interface actually becomes active. This process would be much 
simpler if NovaMondrian were integrated right into the NovaLink server 
application. And for those who like to write externals, especially ones 
taking full advantage of the GUI, a more complete toolkit would be handy. 
Many important graphics routines are missing from the current version. Also 
lacking on the external front is the ability to schedule events. No third 
party external can be set to run automatically at a given time. This greatly 
inhibits programmers writing externals to perform automatic user purges every 
night, running a disk optimization routine without user intervention, or 
other automatic system maintenance functions.

Overall, NovaLink Professional is a versatile, competent communications 
package capable of handling from the smallest hobbyist BBS to large and 
complex corporate systems. Other than some minor glitches, the product is 
quite stable and bug free.  Also, direct support is available from ResNova's 
BBS where free software updates and bug fixes are available to registered 
NovaLink users.

Chris Holmes is product of Abbott Integration, a Vancouver, BC-based 
wholesale distributor of Macintosh-related peripherals including monitors, 
modems, video cards, and hard drives. To contact ResNova for more 
information, call ResNova Software, Inc. at (714) 379-9000 (voice); (714)

 WINDOWS CLIENT FROM FIRST CLASS
 -------------------------------
 by Bill Gram-Reefer

SoftArc, developers of FirstClass BBS software for the Macintosh, has 
released its graphical client program that can be used on PCs running 
Windows. The FirstClass Client for Windows permits users to connect to 
Macintosh-based FirstClass servers via a network or by modem for 
instantaneous e-mail, asynchronous multiple-file transfers, cross platform 
chat, and conferencing. With features and functionality almost identical to 
the Mac-based client, FirstClass Client for Windows requires an Intel 
386-based PC running Windows 3.1 or newer, with a minimum of 4 Mb of RAM.

FirstClass Client for Windows operates on FirstClass systems running host 
version 2.4, which is freely available, but only when downloaded by any 
registered FirstClass owner. In addition to version 2.4 of the host program, 
sysops must also purchase the necessary  program modules. In order to accept 
Windows logins via modem, FirstClass servers require the FirstClass Windows 
User Interface option ($295) for unlimited users. Sites wishing to 
accommodate Windows users over a network require the Windows interface, plus 
the FirstClass IPX connection module available for $495.

Freely distributable, those wishing to obtain a copy of the Windows client 
can download it from SoftArc Online, SoftArc's corporate support system at 
416-609-2250. The program is also available on CompuServe and America Online 
in their respective networking forums. Also available from the same sources 
is a freely distributable demo of FirstClass that runs under Windows. SoftArc

 TELEFINDER ADDS FEATURES
 ------------------------

Spider Island Software, maker of TeleFinder, a leading multi-line bulletin 
board system (BBS) for Macintosh , is now shipping Version 3.1 of its Group 
Edition Host software. With the addition of a Chat Server module, Spider 
Island now gives TeleFinder BBS operators (sysops) the ability to offer 
callers real-time, private messaging with other active modem or AppleTalk 
nodes on a system, where the number of simultaneous one-to-one sessions is 
limited only by the number of telephone lines supported by the Macintosh CPU. 
While online, users are able to view a list of current callers available for 
chat. Additionally, special chat rooms can be created where multiple callers 
can hold live conferences via a Chat Window that clearly identifies 
participants and displays a group+s conversation, which can be logged and 
saved for review. Sysops can easily restrict and regulate access to any of 
these conference areas by assigning privileges according to groups and or 
individuals.

In addition, version 3.1 of the client software allows users to preview 
compressed, thumbnail PICT files and their captions online. This enables 
users to view files, compressed using JPEG or any other ANPA file-standard 
format, before they decide to download the file. Another important addition 
allows sysops and users to format text in both the messaging and conference 
areas. This new capability gives callers the ability to customize their 
messages in a variety of ways: by adding color, or in choosing any 
combination of font, size, and style commands.

TeleFinder 3.1, runs on all Macintosh computers from the Plus to the Quadras, 
is 32-bit clean, System 7 Savvy, can be fully controlled via AppleEvents for 
customized system integration, and includes full Balloon Help. With a retail 
price of $425 and available direct from Spider Island and through its 
authorized resellers, TeleFinder Group Edition Version 3.1 includes the full 
suite of BBS host program modules, user-access software with unlimited 
distribution license, and full documentation.

 STUMP THE CHUMP
 ---------------

Most of you don't know this, but Santa Claus was a liberal arts major and, 
although he uses FileMaker Pro on his frocked Quadra system to keep track of 
the naughty and nice, he's still not very technically proficient when it 
comes to bits and bytes. So, just to keep him sharp and up-to-date, I like to 
send him some of the tough, technical BBS questions you dear readers send me. 
That way Santa and his elves have something to ponder as they totter through 
the summer in Belize while knocking down an endless procession of Strawberry 
Margarita Slurpees. (Now you know why Rudolph has a red nose). And, just to 
make it really tough, I like to throw in the occasional cross-platform 
conundrum just to keep the big guy honest.

For instance, Dennis Spector, of Oakland, CA writes: "I'm the sysop of the 
Miata BBS running on a PC with Mustang's Wildcat BBS software. I know callers 
are concerned about keeping phone bills down to a minimum, and I usually 
suggest that besides using a long-distance service (such as Global Access or 
PC Pursuit), the best way to cut phone bills is by cutting down time online.

"I've come to really appreciate off-line mail readers for this reason. Most 
BBSs have a amail door' which allows a caller to logon to a BBS and download 
a compressed mail packet containing all new messages, a list of any new 
files, and any updated bulletins or newsletters, all compressed into a .QWK 
mail packer which requires the use of an off-line mail reader, like Mustang's 
OLX (Off Line Express) to decipher. In addition to allowing the caller to 
read all the new mail while off-line, mail readers also allow the caller to 
compose replies and new messages while off-line. Replies are compressed into 
a .REP mail packet which is uploaded to the BBS through the mail door. 
Usually uploading a .REP packet and downloading a .QWK packet only takes a 
minute or two, significantly reducing user phone bills. The problem is, I 
want to provide this same service to Mac users. Can you help me solve this 
dilemma?

Santa responds: "First, its important to offer .QWK packet compression with 
PKZIP110. Using this older version will allow Mac users to unzip their mail 
with UNZIP101.SIT, then read their mail with a Mac off-line reader such as 
FREDDIE. If you offer these files to your Mac users it will also help to have 
STUFFIT LITE and COMPACT PRO so users can uncompress the .SIT and .CPT 
files."

Easy enough, North Pole U., but that was the 20-point toss-up. Now, here's 
you're bonus question from Bob de Violini of Oxnard, CA: "The basic question 
is this, aIs there a means for a Macintosh computer to transmit the Function 
and Cursor Key codes generated by an IBM-compatible PC?'

"The situation is this. My wife and I run a PC-based BBS that contains the 
card catalog for the American Philatelic Research Library. The library itself 
is in State College, PA, and a second version of this BBS is being 
established here in Oxnard, CA. Our site is a test site established several 
months ago so we could learn the system and try to make it as simple as 
possible for non-computer techies to utilize.

"Called the Philatelic Lit BBS, the system runs on Wildcat! 3.55. It uses 
Doors to let users get into the catalog program and browse the holdings of 
some 12,000 titles so that they can leave a message asking that a particular 
title be sent to them on loan. To properly use the catalog program, the 
Function keys must be accessible on the caller's keyboard. QModem and Telix 
let the caller do this with a Doors toggle (ALT=); Procomm Plus does this in 
the IBM PC terminal emulation mode.

"We have a number of people who call in on their Macs, and though they can 
get into the catalog, they cannot move around in it or exit gracefully. If 
the sysop doesn't happen to be on hand top see what's happened and can take 
the caller back to the BBS menu, then about the only way out is to hang-up 
with an ALT-H command. Is there some procedure that we can advise our 
Macintosh clients about that will let them access this database. I understand 
that some Mac keyboards have function keys; perhaps they can be programmed 
for that purpose; but I'm not sure if other keyboards can be remapped. Any 
guidance that you can provide will be appreciated."

Santa responds: "This is a tough one, so I deferred to my elves who recommend 
the following: Don't use a PowerBook (ha-ha, just kidding; those elves are 
always trying to jerk my chain). Their overall opinion is your users must be 
using non-ANSI, rock-bottom shareware instead of more fully-featured 
products. Keyboard remapping utilities are available that can indeed reassign 
keys and combinations for specific custom purposes. The problem is trying to 
redefine W, A, Z, and S to replace up, left, down, and right can get a little 
dicey, especially if your name is WAZ.  Have your callers use an 
Apple-compatible extended keyboard that includes the function keys. In 
concert with Quick Keys they should be able to map the commands safely. 
Alternatively, some commercial telecommunications packages for the Mac offer 
a keypad simulating DEC VT100 mode, allowing access to some otherwise 
unattainable commands. Freesoft's White Knight telecom package, for instance, 
lets users employ macro keys to map commands. Another alternative provided by 
White Knight version 11.14, is its VT status bar that has all the commands on 
screen as push buttons that users can access.

Thanks to Santa and his many elves, two tough dilemmas in the ongoing 
struggle for cross-platform connectivity have been solved. So keep those 
cards and letters coming. And, don't make the questions too hard; cause if 
you do stump the chump, come Christmas, you just might get a lump of coal 
instead of that Quadra. Miata BBS, (510)658-0138; Philatelic Lit BBS

 MAC BBS OF THE MONTH
 --------------------

Bud Grove writes to tell us that he runs the BBS for Hughes Aircraft, 
MacHACers Computer Club. They run two lines under Second Sight. Line one 
employs a USR Dual chopper. Loaded for bear, the system includes a 650 Mb 
optical drive, a Pioneer 6-deck CD-ROM player, and a 310 Mb hard drive 
keeping over 1,500 users happy since 1979 on an Apple II. Give them a call 
and check it out: (310)549-9640 bbs.

We were pleased to see the launch of DESIGNLINK, a BBS based in Walnut Creek, 
CA. Accessible by Macs and PCs running either DOS or Windows, DESIGNLINK 
intends to be a complete online resource for designers, publishing 
professionals, photographers, and artists.

The BBS features conferences for free job listings, technical help, legal 
advice, and professional counseling. Designers, artists, and photographers in 
the PHOTOLINK section can display their portfolios for online viewing or 
downloads using very low resolution thumbnails for security purposes. 
DESIGNLINK also has a wide selection of of shareware applications including 
fonts, utilities, music, and graphics files. By January 1994, according to 
Ash Mehta, the system administrator, DESIGNLINK will also support an Internet 
gateway for global e-mail and file transfers. Access is free for 30 minutes 
per day. Other plans for more daily time allotments are available for a 
reasonable fee.

While the BBS offers photographers and others space to display their work, 
DESIGNLINK does not act as the artist's agent. If you like what you see, you 
can contact the photographer directly. In addition to photography, the BBS is 
interested in showcasing portfolios from other artists including 
illustrators, designers, and other commercial artists. Art displayed in the 
PHOTOLINK and other sections is NOT public domain or shareware, being the 
property and copyright of the artists. Use without the permission of the 
artist is against the law.

The premise here is that art directors and designers in need of photographers 
or illustrators can view photos online, like Mr. Phelps in Mission 
Impossible, when he determines which special agents he'll use for each week's 
episode. More than a half dozen photographers with many national credits had 
already signed-on when we took a look at the board in early June. The 
response, according to Ash, has been tremendous, while the California Lawyers 
for the Arts has already rented a folder for its own organization which 
features a workshop and library in addition to private conference areas.

In addition to PHOTOLINK, the BBS offers VENDORLINK, PORTFOLIOS, MAC FILES, 
LEGAL, WINDOWS, HELP, AND DISCUSSION folders. The MAC FILES, include 
subfolders for fonts, demos, graphics, multimedia, page layout, word 
processing, utilities, modems, updates, music, and more.

The payment plans, themselves offer intriguing possibilities. Besides the 
free, 30-minute-per-day plan, subscribers can sign-up for an hour or two of 
access time per day for $50 or $100 dollars respectively. Plan C, for $500 a 
year, with an introductory discount at $250 provides even more intruiging 
possibilities. For this paltry sum, you get a folder on DESIGNLINK to do with 
as you wish. Your company could use this folder as its own BBS for customer 
support, 24-hr. tech support, or use it as an inexpensive e-mail system. 
Alternatively, artists, photographers, cooperatives, or stock agencies could 
display artwork (in very low resolution) for callers to peruse as a form of 
advertising or previewing of work by potential clients.

One of the few BBSs I've seen that actually has a merchant account for Visa 
and Mastercard, DESIGNLINK is a smart concept and well executedu-so far. 
Renting space to allied organizations, service providers, and commercial 
interests makes a lot of sense and more fully takes advantage of the BBS 
technology available for the Mac that actually lets you run many BBSs through 
one system by controlling paths and privileges or access to particular 
folders. $500 for a year's worth of access to Internet e-mail and your own 
folder to run your business BBS approaches "steal" territory, and I imagine 
that if local concerns don't take advantage of this quickly, the price will 
go up.

But, unless DESIGNLINK looks into 800, 900, or X.25 access, I don't believe 
it will attract the critical mass of art on hand if photographers and other 
dirt-poor, children's-book illustrators have to pay long-distance fees to 
upload their work. That chicken-egg problem could militate against big-time 
agencies keeping accounts to keep track of new artists. It would seem that 
having your portfolio built up in the first place is the key to taking 
advantage of such a service. It will be interesting to see if the BBS works 
out any distribution rights for stock images from specific artists, groups, 
or syndicates along the lines of a Wieck Photo Database. DESIGNLINK, 2034

 UNDERSTANDING JPEG OR "HONEY, I SHRUNK THE PICTURES"
 ----------------------------------------------------
 By Jim Thompson
 Western News Service

Working with high quality color images is not all fun and games. The initial
excitement of capturing and manipulating full color images and photographs is
soon tempered by the many challenges and difficulties that are part of the
equation.

One of the biggest problems is dealing with the large file sizes such images
require. A high quality 24-bit, full-color photo typically requires
approximately 4-megabytes to 7-megabytes of disk space. An image suitable for
publication in a high-gloss magazine can take up as much as 30-megabytes of
disk space!

If you are offering such images on a BBS, the problem becomes major. A
1-megabyte file requires approximately 15 minutes to transmit at 9600 baud.
That means approximately an hour and 45 minutes to transmit a 7-megabyte
file!

Fortunately, there is an answer u JPEG image compression. A 1-megabyte image
that is compressed at a ratio of 10:1 using the JPEG standard would,
typically, take only 90 seconds to transmit at 9600 baud. It would take less
than 11 minutes to transfer a 7-megabyte file compressed under JPEG at 9600
baud.

You should be aware that there is a difference between image compression
(such as JPEG) and data compression (such as PKZIP, STUFFIT and STACKER).

Under data compression, it is assumed that all data is critical, so nothing
is lost during the compression process. This is known as lossless compression
because the data is simply stored in a more compact format. You can use data
compression on images but the savings of space is only marginal. Normally,
the file can be reduced by 10% to 20% but it can go as high as 50% if the
image has large regions of the same color. This may sound like a lot, but
considering that high quality images will be approximately 8-megabytes, a 20%
savings still means a file that is 6.4-megabytes.

Image compression, like JPEG, is much more complex and more efficient. Image
compression programs must be able to reduce file sizes by up to 99% which
means a certain portion of the image will be lost. This type of compression
is called lossy because it eliminates some of the "unnecessary" data without,
at least in theory, affecting the overall quality of the image itself.

JPEG stands for "Joint Photographic Experts Group" which is a joint committee
of the International Standards Organization (ISO) and the Consultative
Committee of the International Telegraph and Telephone (CCITT) standards
associations. The core committee members are from leading image processing
and computer companies including DEC, IBM, Mitsubishi, Kodak, NEC, and
Siemens.

Working with some of the top technicians in the world, this group has
developed a standard for the compression and decompression of continuous tone
images which is know as JPEG.

JPEG compresses images by removing redundant data and data to which the human
eye is less sensitive. According to recent experiments, the human eye
requires lower frequency information for visual understanding. This
understanding lead scientists to develop the Adaptive Discrete Cosine
Transform (ADCT) image compression method, upon which JPEG is based.

According to Storm Technology, one of the leaders in the development and
application of JPEG, "ADCT quantizes high frequency image data less
distinctly, so that the majority of coefficients, each identified with a
given frequency, will have a zero value. Multiple, repetitive zeros can be
expressed with fewer bits, thereby compressing overall image file size."

JPEG analyzes and recodes image file data while economizing on bits. The bits
removed are either redundant (because they describe the qualities of one
pixel that also pertain to the range of pixels around it), or they contain
visual information that can be eliminated without affecting image quality.
These bits represent luminance (light intensity) and chrominance (color)
values that have frequencies which fall outside the range of frequencies to
which the human eye is sensitive.

What is means is that the JPEG process eliminates redundancy in an image
during compression and attempts to replace the lost areas on decompression.
While this is great in theory, the result is a loss of quality. You can
compensate for much of this loss by selecting the amount of compression under
JPEG.  A photo that is destined only for on-screen viewing can use maximum
compression (a ratio of 100:1). You can select a less drastic compression
ratio for a photo that will be published. Generally, a compression ratio of
8:1 or less will result in no perceptible loss in quality.

Also, once data has been removed from an image through the JPEG compression
process, additional data will not be removed if the JPEG process is
re-applied to the image. "JPEG will not remove any additional dataueven if
compression is applied over and over againuprovided the image is decompressed
and compressed again using the - initial compression setting," says Storm
Technology.

The actual amount of compression will depend on the image in question. Visual
information is distributed differently in every image. One image might have a
complex, multicolored background that is difficult to compress without
affecting quality, while another might have one background color with a lot
of redundancy that can be compressed easily.

The speed of compression depends on several factors. The most important is
the type of computer you are using.  As always, the faster the processor, the
faster the compression speed. On a 386/33 machine, it takes approximately
2-minutes to compress a 4-megabyte image at a ratio of 20:1.  The decompress
process takes approximately the same amount of time. A number of companies,
among them SuperMac, offer a hardware solution. Their Thunderstorm
Accelerator card, which sells for $995, can speed up the compression process
by as much as 500-percent.

JPEG MOTION COMPRESSION

A variation of JPEG, called MPEG (Motion Picture Experts Group), is also
available for the compression of video images.

The goals of the two groups, JPEG and MPEG are inherently different. The JPEG
standard is quality-driven, i.e. when working with still images, maintaining
the highest possible quality during compression is the key goal.

According to Storm Technology, "The MPEG standard is speed-driven, i.e. MPEG
is optimized for CD-ROM applications, where data is compressed at 1.1
megabits per second. Video should move at 30 frames per second, and since
images are shown in motion on relatively low-resolution monitors, the MPEG
algorithm uses interframe correlation to deliver very high compression ratios
while sacrificing image quality."

Under JPEG still image compression, every part of an image is examined. A
decision on which information can be removed is made and then it is removed.
Under video compression the process is similar with the addition that an
inter-frame correlation is conducted. This process consists of examining a
sequence of video frames, comparing the changes from frame to frame, and then
only storing the changes.

As a result, entire video sequences must be decompressed in order to view or
edit one frame. With still image compression, on the other hand, images are
stored as individual files, so they can be recalled and edited one at a time
quite easily.

Video image compression is still in its infancy. The compression and, most
importantly, the decompression process requires specialized hardware. Various
accelerator and/or compression cards are available, but most still do not
allow for full motion decompression.

Normal motion pictures run at 30-frames per second. Typically, a motion
picture shown in a 160x120 pixel frame can be decompressed and viewed at
14-frames to 20-frames per second depending on the speed of the computer
processor. But all this is changing and the day will soon arrive when full
motion video compression/decompression will be widely available.

NEW STANDARD FOR WINDOWS

The JPEG standard is rapidly being adopted by both the publishing industry
and the computer industry. In July, 20 leading multimedia software and
hardware vendors agreed to standardize on JPEG for bit-mapped images and
compressed video data under the Microsoft Windows operating system.

JPEG still-image files will be supported under Microsoft Windows as device
independent bitmaps (DIB) files, and JPEG video files will be supported under
Video for Windows as audio/video interleaved (AVI) files.

The acceptance of JPEG means that hardware and software products running
under Windows will work together seamlessly.  This means better products and
lower costs.

Vendors who have agreed to endorse the standard JPEG format include AMDRIX
Software; C-Cube Microsystems; Cirrus Logic; Creative Labs; Dolch Computer
Systems; Fluent Inc.; Intel Corporation; LSI Logic Corporation; Microsoft
Corporation; Motorola; New Media Graphics; Optibase; SuperMac; Telephoto;
Texas Instruments; Truevision; U-Lead Systems; Videologic; Xing Technology
Inc.; and Zoran.

To give the technology an additional push, Microsoft is offering
specifications on the JPEG file format to anyone who requests it.

WEALTH OF PROGRAMS AVAILABLE

If JPEG sounds like what you need, you will find a wealth of programs, both
commercial and shareware, that support this standard.

For PC users, the top commercial programs include Aldus PhotoStyler, Adobe
PhotoShop for Windows and Picture Publisher from Micrografx. For the MAC
user, there is Adobe PhotoShop and PicturePress from Storm Technology.

Of these commercial packages, PicturePress is the only one dedicated to JPEG.
In my tests, I found PicturePress to be the fastest of all the packages in
both the compression and decompression process. It also compresses images to
a greater degree than any other Macintosh program. Additionally, it includes
a plug-in module for Adobe PhotoShop, so it can be accessed directly from
this program.

The user's license also includes PictureDecompress. This utility program can
be distributed at no cost with your compressed images. It allows users to
decompress and view the images and to store them in either PICT or TIFF
format. Frontier Runtime (also included with the package) is a script
language that allows for PicturePress to be run automatically in the
background and for batch compression of images. PicturePress also produces
thumbnails of the image so you can quickly identify the image before
decompression. The ability to attach text (up to 32k) to the image means that
you will always have full information about the image.

One of the best features of the program is selective image compression. This
allow you to save selected portions of an image at different quality levels.
For example, in a single image, the focal point could be saved using a high
quality compression while a high amount of compression could be applied to a
less important area, such as the background.

If you are a MAC user and need or want JPEG compression, you should
definitely have PicturePress. Unfortunately, Storm Technology does not make a
PC version.

The other commercial packages mentioned above not only include JPEG
compression and decompression, but also offer most of the power of a color
prepress system right on your own desktop.

PhotoStyler, PhotoShop and Picture Publisher all allow you to enhance, crop
or color correct electronic photographs. In fact, they offer all the tools of
a full-featured electronic darkroom. They will even convert your photos or
images to or from a multiple of formats. In addition to JPEG, the supported
formats are GIF, EPS , PCX, TIFF, TARGA, and BMP. They all also support the
new Kodak CD format.

There are also a number of surprisingly sophisticated programs on the
shareware front. They include: Graphics Workshop and Image Alchemy from
Alchemy Mindworks, Inc. Both offer JPEG along with the ability to convert to
and from various other formats including IMG, PCX, GIF, TIFF, WPG, MSP,
IFF/LBM, BMP, RLE, Halo CUT and Targa.

If you are looking for more information about image compression, image
capturing or the latest in hardware, one of the best places is Samy's Camera
in Hollywood, California. Besides being great guys, Alan Adler and Jack
Etzion in their electronic imaging department are two of the most
knowledgable people in the field.

CONCLUSIONS

JPEG is rapidly becoming a standard for the transmission and storage of high
quality images. However, this does not mean it is the best method for all
applications. When storing and transmitting images that are ultimately
destined for publication in a newspaper or magazine or in applications where
a high quality output is required, JPEG is as good as it gets. Although there
is loss in the compression process, this can be minimized because of the
ability to select the compression level. Also, JPEG viewers are plentiful and
cheap. With the acceptance of the JPEG and MPEG standards for the Microsoft
Windows operating environment by 20 of the major computer corporations, JPEG
will soon be available to virtually everyone.

However, when it comes to "on-line viewing" where highly compressed images
are required, the best method I have seen is "fractal compression" as
developed by Iterated Systems, Inc. and implemented by Imagen, Inc. in their
Fracterm program. (See the May, 1993 issue of Boardwatch Magazine for a full
explanation of fractal image compression and a review of Fracterm.)

For an on-line environment which allows for "real-time" image viewing, it is
necessary that images be very small (10-25k). This allows for quick
downloading and display. A JPEG image of such size is of marginal quality.
Generally speaking, a 20k JPEG image would look fine if it filled no more
than one-fourth of a 14-inch monitor. The quality of the image would
noticeably decrease as the image size was increased.

When displaying an image "on-line" this means either a larger file size for
an image that can be "downsized" without loss of quality or it means
providing several copies (each of a different size and resolution) of the
same file.  This is not the case with fractal compression.

Fractal image compression has the advantage because it is "resolution
independent." If you want to display an image on a larger monitor (for
example, a 19-inch display) the fractal image will expand to fill the entire
screen without the need to increase the file size of the image.

We use both JPEG and fractal on Marlboro Racing News. Callers go to the
fractal area for on-line viewing of images. This allows them to actually see
the photos and caption text. After selecting the image or images they want,
the caller can download the more robust JPEG image (approximately 250k). When
uncompressed, this image expands to approximately 5-megabytes and is suitable
for insertion into a newspaper or magazine.

HOW THE IMAGES WERE COMPRESSED

All five of the images were compressed using Aldus Photstyler running on a
386/33 with 16-megabytes of RAM. When compressing with JPEG, a slider bar
with a range of 1 to 100 allows for varying levels of compression. Image
quality decreases as the compression increases. A compression level of 1
yields the least amount of compression but the highest quality. A compression
level of 100 yields the highest possible compression but the least quality.

FrEdMail Offers BBS Package Based on ResNova's NovaLink Pro Following a May 
announcement, the FrEdMail Foundation, in partnership with Irvine, CA-based 
ResNova, and educational technology consultant Raymond G. Harder, continues 
its plans to introduce a turnkey BBS package to schools based on ResNova+s 
NovaLink Professional host and client software for the Macintosh. With five 
schools slated to begin testing the package in September, the system has been 
designed to give students and teachers access to all of the acclaimed 
FrEdMail and SCHLnet news groups, mail, and curriculum development services 
without limitations.

By using NovaLink Professional as the basis for the system, multiple users 
will be able to access the Foundation+s services directly by modem or across 
local or wide area networks using AppleTalk, Ethernet, or TCP/IP. Users can 
access information or electronic mail from a friendly Mac graphical 
interface. Or, by teaming up with Telegrafix Communications Inc., ResNova has 
also provided DOS and Windows users with an easy-to-navigate graphical 
interface based on RipScript, an emerging industry graphics standard.  
Current FrEdMail call-in methods and platforms will not change. Because the 
system will support terminal windows and the VT100 protocol, Experienced 
FrEdMail users not using the graphical systems will see virtually the same 
"ASCII-like" system they have become comfortable with.

Attempting to provide an affordable plug-and-play communications package, the 
specially designed NovaLink BBS will be totally compatible with existing 
FrEdMail formats. The package consists of NovaLink Professional host software 
capable of supporting two telephone lines providing access by up to five 
AppleTalk nodes, supporting 25 users. TCP/IP connectivity tools are included 
for Internet access to SCHLnet. Pricing for this standard package is pegged 
at $799. By purchasing an upgrade module the system will support 40 AppleTalk 
nodes and unlimited users for a total package price of $2,500. The FrEdMail 
Foundation will continue to provide its high-quality content services and 
domain addressing for an annual fee of $250 for access to FrEdMail, all 
associated news groups, and SCHLnet. Additionally, the FrEdMail Foundation 
manages all of the news groups, supervising the electronic hallways for 
compliance to the rules of engagement.

"It may not be as sophisticated as a Microsoft Mail," noted Al Rogers, 
president of the FrEdMail Foundation, "but with point and click ease-of-use, 
and multi-user access to the FrEdMail services, it's an attractive offer. We 
are impressed with ResNova's technology, customer service, and commitment to 
and interest in the educational market."

In addition to news groups, and mail, teachers have access to the FrEdMail 
curriculum projects where they can seek customized assistance for developing 
lesson plans for students using computers in the classroom. Additionally, via 
NovaLink's TCP/IP connection capability, subscribers will have full access to 
to SCHLnet, which takes advantage of Usenet transport protocols to deliver 
distributed conferencing to educators from around the world. SCHLnet uses 
Usenet format news groups to create mini-usenets specifically targeted to 
K-12 teachers and their students. SCHLnet offers an interactive flea-market 
of ideas, resources, opportunities, and information of specific relevance to 
teachers and students. Because SCHLnet's audience includes young children, it 
prohibits profane, discourteous, abusive, racist, sexist, obscene, and 
sexually explicit language within its news groups, the sometimes offensive 
distractions posed by some of Usenet's careless users intent on making 
"freedom of speech" an annoyance. SCHLnet takes care of most of the typical 
"noise control" problems found on Internet news groups by actively moderating 
the groups, and by moving your listserv and group mail topics out of personal 
mail boxes and putting them into the SCHLnet conference area, organized by 
topic, and ready for browsing when you are ready. Your mailbox is used only 
for personal correspondence.

The FrEdMail Foundation is a California non-profit organization sponsoring 
electronic mail, and educational conferencing. In addition to FrEdMail and 
SCHLnet, the organization offers Telesensations: The Educator's Handbook to 
Telecomputing, its newsletter FrEd News, and a variety of training videos.

 ACCESS TO GOVERNMENT
 ====================

 LEGISLATIVE INFORMATION FOR CITIZEN PARTICIPATION
 -------------------------------------------------
 by Jim Warren

We were told in school that our government was by the People, for the People 
and of the People.  But many of us think it has become government by career 
politicians, for special interests and of the bureaucrats.  Most just snarl 
and try to avoid it, whine when they are forced to face it, and say ya can't 
fight city hall.  But we can; all it takes time and effort.

And networked computers are the potent weapons for achieving and defending 
freedom into the 21st Century  Begun perhaps appropriately on July 4th, this 
column concerns practical [electronic] access to public information, 
government decision-making and to effective political action.  First, some 
principles, then generalities and finally some specifics u and many more in 
future columns.

Some principles of [21st Century] freedom:

  Timely [electronic] access to useful information is the foundation for 
  sound decisions.

  Mass [electronic] communications are the essential tools for successfully 
  pursuing change.

  [Online] citizen access to [computerized] government information is an 
  absolute prerequisite for a free society.

Government Records Access

Government maintains the largest repository of information essential for 
societal decision-making.  And, it's said that by the mid-`90s, the majority 
of government records will be computerized u to aid governmental operations 
and efficiency.

But, there remains major controversy surrounding who u outside of government 
u will have access to what records, in what time-frame, distributed where, 
for what uses, inwhat forms u and most especially, for how much cost.

Most states have "open government laws" including Public Records Acts (PRAs), 
and the feds have the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA).  These mandate 
public access to government records, although with numerous exclusions.

Most open records laws however, focus on permitting citizens to examine 
[paper] records and receive paper copies, regardless of their 
often-computerized internal form.  And paper is the least-useful form of 
information storage u all one can do is read paper records (and perform 
environmentally-unkind acts with them).

The Data Wars

Although we rarely notice the gunfire, electronic access to these government 
treasure troves are major battlegrounds.  And most of the war will be 
concluded before the end of the decade.

The outcome will go far to determining whether we have a free society where 
citizens have a reasonable opportunity to be fully informed and effectively 
participate, or one where only corporations and well-healed hustlers will 
have timely, useful access to government u with most folks remaining 
obedient, ill-informed, drones, occasionally exercising delusions of 
democracy in well-orchestrated elections separated by numerous ineffective 
outbursts of frustration.

The maneuvering armies include:

  Funds-hungry government agencies.

  The information industry, especially the online database purveyors.

  The RBOCs u the regional Bell [telephone] operating companies.

  Many of the larger cable operators.

  A few broadcast license holders.

  Some cellular operators and radio manufacturers.

  State and federal regulatory agencies (PUCs, FCC, etc.).

  Some database and GIS [geographic information system] software vendors.

  Personal-privacy advocates.

  A few consumer and good-government advocates.

And there's one more notable army:

The 10- to 20-million users of interconnected computers u a growing force 
that is irresistible, when it acts.

Some posterior-protecting politicians and bureaucracy barons treat these 
computer-wielding citizens as Mongol hoards; as malcontents arrogantly 
seeking to be informed participants in their own governance u and through 
fear or fury attempt to pull up the data-drawbridge before the serfs can 
enter their turf.  But most agencies appear to be quite willing to grant the 
public electronic access u provided their off-budget profits are sufficient 
[they call it revenues].  I.e., they're willing to perform as desired; 
they're just haggling over the price.

The info-turf being coveted includes:

  Legislative, executive and judicial records.

  Federal, state and local records.

  Text, database, graphic and geographic information.

  Control of access.

  Control of distribution.

  Control of use.

Legislative Data: The Key

Sovereignty u power u ultimately always rests with the People, but only when 
they act in concert, which requires information, communications and 
coordination.

Okay, recognizing that our connected thinkertoys can fulfill those 
prerequisites, consider the impact on legislation u the legal form for 
exercising our power.

Convenient, timely access [online] to full information about 
legislation-in-process, priced no greater than its incremental distribution 
cost [near-nil], available in useful form [computerized], can empower 
informed, effective citizen participation in the legislative process u that 
is simply not functionally possible when information is only available via 
paper records delivered [eventually] by snailmail.

Adequate online access permits:

  Access at all times on all days.

  Electronic copies at less cost and delay than paper information.

  Independent citizen access to complete records u not just evening 
  sound-bites or all the news that fits.

  Indexing and searching bills, amendments, analyses, minutes, schedules and 
  votes for items of interest.

  Cross-referencing to diverse related online and archived information within 
  and outside of government sources.

  Extracting and circulating items to as many or as few people as desired, 
  often within only minutes or hours, at little or no cost to the transmitter 
  or recipients.

  Tracking amendments almost as quickly as can lobbyists, legislators and 
  bureaucrats.

  Remaining automatically-notified of new legislation and amendments 
  containing "interesting" words or phrases.

  Providing timely legislative information-access to those with impairments 
  of hearing, vision, dexterity or mobility.

Using the public networks for timely access to legislative information and to 
each other can permit the People to retake much of the power that is 
currently limited u by lack of access u to Beltway Bandits, capitol hustlers, 
lobbyists, etc.; i.e., well-organized special-interest groups that can get 
the information and organize their actions.

Example: California Legislative Data

If Assembly Bill 1624 authored by Debra Bowen (D-Torrance) becomes law, 
California may become the first state to offer public access via the public 
nets to almost all public legislative information [already-computerized] u 
including the state codes [statutes] and volumous State Constitution.

Implementation would require little more than a $5,000 file-server with a 
gigabyte disk and a $2,000 network connection that will cost about $200 per 
month to operate.  Since prorating those costs across perhaps a million 
potential users would be orders of magnitude less than the expense of billing 
and collection, AB1624 mandates that the state charge nothing for this 
access.

[Full disclosure:  Bowen introduced the bill without implementation details, 
mandating only public access by computer modem.  I drafted a 15-page analysis 
and implementation proposal and have assisted with much of the amendment 
language that would require its use.  However, I have no business or 
financial interest in its outcome; just a great civic interest.]

There have been no official opponents of this bill.  However, some of the 
Legislature's most powerful insiders u unelected, profit-seeking bureaucrats 
u have been fighting it with misdirection, foolish fears, misleading 
information and even by providing flat-out false information to legislators 
and their staff.

For snailmailed details of AB1624, contact Hon. Debra Bowen, State Capitol, 
Room 3126, Sacramento CA 95814; (916)445-8528; fax (916)327-2201.

The only thing that has kept this legislation afloat has been massive public 
support in the form of letters and faxes generated almost entirely from the 
nets.  [Note:  Phone calls are nice, but count for very little in persuading 
other legislators.]

Emailed details, updates and action-alerts are available from 
jwarren@well.sf.ca.us.

FidoNet and other nets' access

If AB1624 passes, it will be implemented using an Internet file-server.  That 
would make the files directly available to all users of 1.4-million Internet 
host computers.

FidoNet gateway operator Tim Pozar, who created UFGATE connecting the 
Internet to FidoNet, has already said that he will provide free access for 
FidoNetters if the state will provide free access in the first place.

Thus, 700,000 to a million Californians (and 10- to 20-million net-users, 
worldwide) who already have direct or indirect Internet access through work, 
schools, universities, FreeNets, libraries or low-cost personal accounts u 
for the first time u would have timely, comprehensive access to California 
legislative information.

America Online (AOL), Compu$erve (CIS), General Electric's GEnie, Delphi, 
MCImail, etc., [but not Plodigy] all have gateways to the Internet and could 
provide their customers with access, if they choose to do so.

Netvolks in all states can initiate and push through similar legislation.

Next month's column will address various specific issues and problems that 
surround online public access to any state's computerized public legislative 
records.  Later columns will address local access and federal access u to 
decision-making processes as well as to data u and address how to use 
networked computers to impact those decisions.

 THE POWER OF THE COMPUTER BULLETIN BOARD
 ----------------------------------------
 by Lance Rose

The recent film The Player portrays Hollywood screenwriters as a sorry lot.  
They submit their careers meekly to the inane caprices of film studios and 
producers, the tedium relieved only by the occasional frustrated psycho.

Based on recent BBS events in Tinseltown, reality may go the movie one 
better.  Writers hoping for work in Hollywood need to join a union called the 
Writers Guild of America West (WGAW), because it holds an exclusive contract 
with the major producers known as the Minimum Basic Agreement.  The Minimum 
Basic Agreement, or "MBA", controls the pay scale, working conditions, and 
most other aspects of every writer's deal with the studios and producers.  
And the guy who represents the writers on all MBA matters is the executive 
director of the WGAW.  As it turns out this hired hand, this union 
administrator, has wielded more power over the collected writers of Hollywood 
than the most powerful and despotic studio boss.

WGAW's current executive director, Brian Walton, has not worn the mantle of 
power with an excess of grace.  According to WGAW member and activist Fred 
Haines, Walton compromised the WGAW's position on almost every major industry 
issue in the past ten years, all in the name of a don't-make-waves agenda 
lovingly termed "industrial harmony."  For instance, Walton settled a 
contract dispute with producers in 1985 by agreeing that guild writers would 
not take a cut of videocassette royalties. Videocassette revenues soon 
afterwards became a major source of revenues for the entire film industry, 
and the writers saw barely any of that money.  Similarly, in 1988 Walton 
agreed that the writers in his union would not get royalties on foreign sales 
of American films.  Haines claims that this cut writers out of one of the 
most lucrative of all modern U.S. industries, a film export industry 
currently running a foreign trade surplus of over 4 billion dollars.  In 
between crafting these wimpy deals, Walton set up a "contract Adjustment 
Committee" within the WGAW charged with supervising changes to the MBA.  This 
group fulfilled its role admirably while belying its name, making no 
"adjustments" at all to the MBA for seven years stretching from its formation 
to the present.

Walton had no trouble getting his way.  Through his control over WGAW's 
newsletter and all other channels of communication, his every concession to 
the other forces of Hollywood was presented to the writers as a fait 
accompli.  Who had the time to second-guess the executive director?  Most 
WGAW members scrabble for writing gigs full time.  The eleven WGAW members on 
the Board never made much difference, either.  When a new guild problem came 
up, the executive director presented them with stacks of paper to wade 
through on their own, together with his own bite-size solution ready for 
approval.  Approval readily granted.  The executive director, paid to spend 
his time on the guild's business, was the only one who could afford to deal 
with the guild's business.  He ruled by fiat.

About five years ago, WGAW set up a computer bulletin board for WGAW members 
only.  It was devoted largely to the conduct of official WGAW business, but 
also served as a social meeting spot for WGAW members.  Official forums 
included the WGA Talk Forum, devoted to union politics and business; the 
Executive Director's Forum, where Walton answered questions from union 
members; and the Announcements Forum, where meeting dates and agendas and 
other important notices were posted to the membership.  Business-related 
forums included the Business of Writing Forum, the Craft of Writing Forum, 
and the Featured Writer Forum, with a monthly guest writer of some 
achievement in the Hollywood writer community.  Finally, there were purely 
social forums dealing with subjects like sports, restaurant reviews and the 
BBS itself.

As the WGAW BBS grew more popular, a new level of awareness of union 
activities arose among the membership.  Haines says that about 1300 of the 
WGAW's 8000 member writers eventually logged on to the board. They started 
learning about new union developments before the executive director dumped 
his version of the news in their laps.  They filled in the gaps in each 
others' knowledge, discerning the real problems and opportunities faced by 
the WGAW, as opposed to the filtered version presented in the 
Board-controlled newsletter.

Following awareness came action.  In a dramatic break from their tradition of 
accepting the smallest of crumbs from new film industry opportunities, WGAW 
members coordinated to take advantage of the latest such opportunity: 
interactive video productions.  Normally, WGAW members would be barred from 
such work.  Interactive video is being developed largely by producers who are 
not signatories to the MBA, and "Rule 8" of the WGAW bars union writers from 
working with non-MBA producers.  But by achieving consensus within the union 
through discussions on the BBS, WGAW members pressured the Board to suspend 
Rule 8 and enable union members to get work in the interactive video arena. 
The union structure itself is also changing.  In the past, union members were 
not able effectively to propose alternatives to the slate of Board directors 
proposed by Walton at each election.  But through the power of the BBS, union 
members who differed with the Board organized sufficient votes to defeat 
incumbent directors at their last two elections.

The BBS organizers' swelling voices were not received with great equanimity 
by the traditional ruling structure of WGAW, especially Mr. Walton.  The 
computer BBS started as a low-cost, high-tech experiment bound to appeal only 
to the techno-weenies of the union, but it grew into a Frankenstein's monster 
threatening to engulf the entire union in a wave of democracy.  The power 
elite responded at first with selective censorship, deleting BBS messages by 
those most outspoken in their criticism of the union's leadership.  
Complaints about the censorship arose, which caused the censorship to 
increase, surging to as many as 200 messages deleted in a single night.

With resistance rising, the Executive Director took things to the next stage 
by mailing WGAW members a written agreement, which they were told they must 
sign or lose their BBS access.  The agreement provided, as a fundamental 
condition of BBS use, that union leaders could remove or censor BBS messages 
for virtually any reason at all.  It also provided that if any members had 
disputes about how the BBS was operated, they must take it to arbitration 
before an arbitrator chosen by the Executive Director.  That would lead to an 
interesting arbitration, especially if the union member in question was 
complaining about the Executive Director himself.

The most vocal of the dissident union members took this latest move as a 
direct attempt to silence them and end their influence on union affairs.  
Accordingly, they refused to sign the agreements, and their BBS access was 
suspended.  The suspended members protested these actions within the union, 
but the feedback from union management, mostly the very people cutting off 
their privileges in the first place, was not encouraging.  Union management 
did revise the agreement somewhat to create a paper recognition that union 
members have a right to speak out within their own union, but on a practical 
level it continued seeking total control of discussion on the BBS.

Not to be put off, the dissident members went straight into federal court in 
Los Angeles, seeking reinstatement of full access to the WGAW BBS and a 
judicial declaration that the BBS user agreement being pushed on members by 
the union leaders was invalid.  Such legal action may seem a bit odd to those 
of us who are accustomed to viewing BBSs as being primarily under the sysops' 
control.  If a sysop does not like the name "Jim", then he should have every 
right in the world to keep all people named Jim off the BBS.  If a sysop 
wants to dictate that callers to his BBS will only talk about apple pie a la 
mode, then even postings on such closely related topics as peach cobbler or 
cherry pie will get the axe, and no one can complain they were treated 
illegally.

But it turns out that a union member's rights within his union are somewhat 
like the rights of a U.S. citizen under the federal government.  We all have 
First Amendment rights to speak freely, with no government interference.  
Similarly, union members have the solemn right to speak openly within their 
union, to roundly criticize leadership if that is their wish, and the union 
leaders legally can do nothing about it.  This, then, was the basis for the 
dissident members' claims against the union: the BBS operated as an open 
forum for the discussion of union issues, and the union's leaders had no 
legal power to limit access to the BBS or censor messages.  By doing so, they 
denied the free speech rights of union members, and violated the law.

As often happens in court, there was some pretty intense procedural jockeying 
between the parties.  First, Walton and the other defendants managed to delay 
the judge in his consideration of the union members' demand to immediately 
restore their access to the union BBS.  When they could delay no longer, the 
defendants completely shut down all public discussion forums on the union's 
BBS, leaving only private e-mail and file transfer functions.  Based on their 
own shutdown, they then argued to the judge that since public BBS forums no 
longer existed, it would be meaningless to mandate access for the union 
members who started the lawsuit.  As lawyers say, the point became moot.

The judge went for the defendants' ploy, holding "the plaintiffs have no 
protected statutory right to open BBS public forums, managed and financed by 
the Guild."  He stated that the union laws relied upon by the dissidents were 
not meant to force unions to maintain effective communications channels for 
their members, but to prevent unions   from keeping their members from 
meeting outside official union forums.  In a footnote, the judge mentioned 
that dissenting union members were in the process of setting up their own 
BBS.

In that incidental reference lay the union members' greatest opportunity of 
all.  About a month ago as of the date this is written, WGAW members not 
willing to see their public BBS forums go down in the flames of union warfare 
set up a new BBS entirely outside official WGAW purview.  The new BBS, called 
Page, is open to all WGAW members as well as all other professional writers 
(those who believe they qualify can call Page at (310)273-7326, - 7243, 
-7395, -7399 or -7419).  Strangely enough, Page is supported not only by the 
dissident union members, but also by many of the union leaders.  It seems 
friend and foe alike at WGAW missed the social world of their BBS.  At two 
weeks of age, Page was already nearly as popular as its predecessor 
five-year-old WGAW BBS, with five lines up and more imminently planned.

Haines and other union protestors plan on appealing the judge's ruling 
against them, but from here that just looks like mop-up work.  The battle's 
already been won by the members of the WGAW union.  They discovered computer 
communication, and the balance of power at WGAW has been forever changed.

 HOT WIRE YOUR FAMILY TREE - GENEALOGY ON-LINE
 ---------------------------------------------
 by Jay Hall

Genealogy is one of the most popular hobbies in the United States, or for
that matter, the world. Literally millions of devotees spend hours each week
looking for their elusive ancestors. While these seemingly normal-looking
people are often seen roaming cemeteries, rifling library shelves, and
sleeping in microfilm readers, a growing number of them are beaming into
cyberspace. It is a common sight at genealogical conventions to see sixty and
seventy year-olds swapping stories about comm software, e-mail addresses, and
remote databases.

You'd almost think it was some kind of "gray power" revolution! What are
these people doing playing with laptops instead of planting petunias?

Frankly, although I've been a professional genealogist for almost twenty
years, it's a little hard to explain. Genealogists range in age from the very
young (ten or less), through young mothers and successful executives, to the
most common group; grandparents. Some do it because they want to pass on
something to their posterity. Some do it because they have a personal
interest in history. Relatively few do it to find glory and lost
inheritances. Can you explain why you get excited about what you find
interesting?

Of course, for readers of Boardwatch, the question is, "What are these people
doing in the ether, and what are they finding here that I'm missing?"

Like a lot of things available via modem, what they are finding is probably
information that can be found elsewhere, they are just finding it faster.

First, a little background on genealogy and research. If you want to know
about your ancestors, the first place you would look was to your own family.
Ask your relatives, look in the family Bible. Or you could go to the village
priest and have him let you look at the church registers of births, marriages
and deaths. Ask someone who knows, or look it up in a book.

As more people became interested in genealogy, they formed societies
("support groups" in a90s newspeak), shared information, and offered to help
each other with their research. When societies got bigger, they started their
own libraries with published books, and transcriptions of records they
thought would help other genealogists.

According to Everton's Genealogical Helper, there are now thousands of local,
state and national genealogical societies in virtually every country. Almost
every one of these societies publishes a magazine or newsletter. Almost all
of them have some kind of a library. And every month hundreds of books on
genealogy are published in the United States alone.

Obviously, there is no lack of people to ask, or books to look in. So why
bother with computers and modems?

Because you can ask more people, and do it faster. And you can look in more
"books," and do it faster.

Virtually every community has local bulletin boards, almost all of which
carry a variety of discussion conferences, networked to other bulletin
boards. Named "genealogy," "ancestry," "roots," etc., discussion groups on
family history can be found on at least a half dozen echo conferences, as
well as on the Internet and the major national services (Genie, Compuserve,
Prodigy, etc.). These forums are used to trade family data, ask for
information on specific surnames, provide information on local libraries and
archives, or give background detail on a variety of subjects.

In the week before writing this article I saw information ranging from the
political and religious history of Finland to weather reports from eighteenth
century Virginia to occupations in nineteenth century America. If you need
it, just ask.

Of course, you still have to wade through the daily traffic to get to your
response. Some national genealogy conferences run over 100K of traffic daily.
In the effort to make it easier, some discussion groups have split into
separate groups for surnames and software. Genie has taken it even further,
with almost a thousand different areas in its genealogy bulletin board for
specific surnames, surname groups, research in specific states and countries,
software support, calendars of genealogical events, religious groups,
technological advances, and specific record types.

And then there are the local bulletin boards devoted to genealogy and family
history. Like the population of bulletin boards in general, the number of
these boards varies from one day to the next, but several of them have become
nationally known as resources for those seeking their roots. Typically these
boards offer network conference areas, local conferences, and file areas
featuring genealogical software. Some even offer searchable databases.

Ah, databases. The holy grail of the researcher. The impossible dream. Tap on
a few keys and presto! Instant ancestry.

Get real.

Current estimates put the earth's population at about 5.5 billion. Assuming
that to be about half of the total historical population of the world, there
have been 10 to 12 billion people on this globe. Just finding out their names
would be a project bigger than building the pyramids or fighting World War
II. And then the relationships would have to be worked out and linked up in a
database. A lot of people have been working on it, but it ain't happened yet.

OK, so maybe you've heard of the Family History Library in Salt Lake City.
True, they have a collection of almost 2 million rolls of microfilm, and
about 500,000 bound volumes. And they have computer databases with almost 200
million names in them. But these are NOT available via modem. You can use the
computer databases (on CD) or view the microfilm at over 1,500 branches of
this library (called Family History Centers), but you can NOT reach out and
touch it with your 2400 baud bit vacuum.

Even so, there are surname databases that you can access. Everton Publishers
maintains several databases on their On-line Search bulletin board, with over
two million names as of the time this article was written. The
soc.roots/ROOTS-L people maintain several databases that can be searched on
the internet via listserver at vm1.nodak.edu. And databases of census
schedules to parish registers are available from as far away as Britain and
Norway.

Even information that is not computerized can be discovered by modem.
Locally, many library systems are operating dial-in catalogs that can be
searched by subject, author, or title, and which will give you the current
status of any copy. On a larger scale, Melvyl (in California) and CARL (in
Colorado) provide internet users with access to a large number of university
and college library catalogs. Access to the catalog of recent acquisitions by
the Library of Congress can also be gained via internet, either through
connection to dra.com, or to the more complete search facilities offered by
LOCIS. Melvyl, CARL, dra.com, and LOCIS are all availabe via gopher.

Once you find a book in one of these catalogs, you can take the information
to your local public library, where they can usually help you arrange an
interlibrary loan of the book you want.

All this, and we haven't even mentioned e-mail yet. From before Ben Franklin,
if you wanted to find something out about your family, you could send a
letter to a relative or an antiquarian to ask for advice. Literally millions
of people, and a growing number of genealogical companies, are hooked up
electronically via a bewildering array of e-mail outfits. Among these are the
major services (Compuserve, Genie, Prodigy), long distance telcos (MCI Mail,
AT&T Mail, Sprintmail), and government or non-profit networks (NASAmail,
PeaceNet). Even local BBSs can get into the e-mail act through services such
as Fidonet. Most of these interact with the internet, allowing people on one
network (say, an e-mail box with MCI) to connect with someone on an entirely
different net (such as the Colorado Supernet).

With the growing number of people using bulleting boards and other services,
and the growing number of connections between networks, it is becoming
easier, cheaper, and faster to send an electronic message to almost anyplace
you can send regular (snail) mail.

Like everything else concerning genealogy and computers, modems, networks,
and databases are revolutionaizing the way people climb their family trees.

 BOARDWATCH 100 READERS' CHOICE BBS CONTEST RESULTS
 --------------------------------------------------

The Boardwatch 100 Readers' Choice BBS Contest closed at the stroke of
midnight terminating the last day of June, 1993 after a six month run.  A
total of 20,200 BBS callers submitted ballots for some 1775 bulletin boards
in this simple popularity contest.  A number of BBS operators ran a variety
of creative promotions to induce their callers to submit ballots on their
behalf.  This served as a point of endless irritation to those operators less
inclined to do so and we received numerous complaints that some systems were
trying to "buy" the contest.  We found this more than a little charming as
one of the purposes of holding such a contest is to "promote" bulletin boards
and induce BBS operators to do so as well.  We're quite pleased they did.

One question that comes up quite often regards the gender mix of the online
community. There seems to be a lot of sentiment that somehow it should
"represent" the society at large.  It doesn't we have to guess.  Of the
20,200 ballots received, 17,943 claimed to be male, and 2257 female
indicating an 88.26% male majority and some 11.74% femmes.  This is actually
MORE one sided than last year's contest where some 14% of the ballots
received were from the gentler gender.

The other question that comes up quite a bit regards age. This was a bit
interesting for me personally.  Two years ago, in an editorial, I noted
somewhat tongue in cheek that I thought ALL BBS operators were just exactly
36 years old. For months we received letters and e-mail from those who were
indeed 36. I have aged two years since then of course and turned 38 last
week.  But interestingly, the online community hasn't.  The average age of
our 20,200 voters was exactly 36.01 years. A bit more widespread examination
shows the following distribution.

Notably, nearly 900 votes were from those over 60 and over 200 votes were
cast by callers OVER the age of 70.  The largest age group of course was the
30-39 group at 29.27% and 74.59% of the population was age 20-49.

Callers averaged 62 calls to bulletin boards per month which we found
surprisingly active.  This is indeed an addictive sport.  They also claimed
an average 55.68 months online which we also found extraordinary.  In fact,
even the 10 years and under age group claimed an average of 33 months online,
so for some, BBS activity appears to begin shortly after their exit from the
womb.

We asked our voters to indicate whether or not they had installed a second
telephone line for data use.  Some 6634 or 32.84% had done so, while the
majority, 13325 or 65.96% still used their voice line.  A surprising total of
241 or 1.19% did not know what a telephone was.

We also took a look at long distance usage.  Actually this was not a question
asked.  We simply examined the area codes callers gave for their voice
numbers and the area code of their favorite BBS.  Again, a very surprising
7092 or 35.11% voted for their FAVORITE BBS in a different area code -
certain to be a long distance call.  We had no way of detecting long distance
dialing within the same area code, but clearly way over a third of BBSing is
NOT a local sport.

As the contest began, we were also curious how well Windows was catching on
in the online community.  And the votes did demonstrate this with some
precision.  Some 11,629 of our voters professed they do use Microsoft Windows
- constituting 57.57% of the population - slightly over half.  Some of the
nays did however include some pretty colorful comments regarding Windows,
it's heritage, Bill Gates, his ancestry, and generally what we could do with
Windows.

Another thing we've followed over the last year or so more or less
successfully is the type of terminal software people use.  Unfortunately,
these statistics were rendered a bit askew by one of the most interesting
ploys of the contest.  In our early returns on the contest which we published
month by month, it was quite difficult to tell Telix and Qmodem apart - they
were pretty much a dead heat for second place behind Procomm Plus with Telix
edging ahead at times and Qmodem at others - statistically a dead heat.  Jeff
Woods, the head of deltaComm development and the new owner of the Telix
program, mounted a serious campaign of getting out the vote for his product
support BBS in the Boardwatch 100 Readers' Choice contest.  By offering a
number of incentives and mailing out thousands of ballot forms, he was
successful enough to rank 3rd in the contest - even though a large number of
voters voted for some OTHER BBS on the ballot form deltaComm provided.  This
is very unusual for a product support BBS, and we were intrigued as to why a
purely product support BBS would even WANT to win a BBS popularity contest -
much less go to this expense. The reason was pretty clear.  They didn't care
whether you voted for their BBS or not, they wanted Telix users to vote, and
thereby appear statistically to be the clear choice over Qmodem.  While this
invalidates the veracity of our statistical analysis of terminal software, at
least with regard to the second/third position, we continue to be utterly in
awe of the ingenuity of the American entrepreneur and the power of the free
enterprise system. Is this cunning or what?  America - WHAT A COUNTRY!

A total of 149 communication programs were represented.  Last year 296
different terminal programs were listed indicating at least some
consolidation in the terminal software program market.

We think the modem usage statistics are a bit more accurate.  The modem
manufacturers listed below comprise all those with greater than a 1% share of
the total.  Some 206 distinct brands of modems were represented in the
contest.  Again the market seems to be consolidating down from 379 brands
available in last years contest. While we tend to follow a few brands in
Boardwatch, it is always surprising to contemplate just how many players
there are in this market. And we still had 3393 ballots from callers who just
didn't know what brand of modem they were using.

At the top of the heap,  Hayes and U.S. Robotics were almost too close to
call with Hayes leading at 2194 callers and U.S. Robotics at 2075 - each
representing a little over 10% of the BBS population.  Zoom Telephonics
trailed slightly at 1697 or 8.40% of the total.  Another battle for fourth
place between Practical Peripherals at 1087 and Supra at 1082 is again
statistically nearly insignificant in difference at just over 5% of the
total.  These rankings and percentages are virtually identical to last years
contest.  The big winners this year seem to be Boca - not even listed as
statistically significant last year and capturing over 3% of the market this
year, Intel, moving from 1.42% last year to 2.44% this year, and ZyXEL,
moving from .38% last year to 1.32% this year.

Modem speeds used is another interesting area.  The 14,400 bps units have
clearly taken over 9600 as the high speed of choice.  Some 47% of the caller
base have moved to 9600 bps speeds or above while almost exactly half of the
caller base remain at 2400 bps.  Callers dialing at 1200 and 300 bps have
essentially disappeared.  The comparison to last year's speeds is perhaps
obvious.  Callers last year dialing at 9600 bps or above totalled 18.42%
while this year they make up some 47% - nearly a 30% advance.  Last year, 59%
of callers were at 2400 as opposed to 50% this year.  And while last year
some 6.31% operated at 1200 bps or lower, this year that cut has dropped to
2.59%.

In this issue, we do present the final list of 100 BBSs garnering the most
votes.  This year, to avoid the inevitable ties, we date stamped all received
ballots and numerically scaled vote values by date with votes entered on the
first day of the contest receiving a score of 180 and the point value of a
ballot decreasing by one point for each day into the contest.  This numerical
weighting is only used to break ties between systems have an identical number
of votes, under the arbitrary and somewhat dubious theory that earlier votes
are somehow better.

The BBS software used by a BBS does influence the final form and presentation
of the BBS to the caller and so is a factor.  But we had participation from a
widely differing sets of TYPES of BBS, with general bulletin boards, chat
bulletin boards, product support bulletin boards, etc. representing many
different "ponds" of online activity.  This makes an analysis of what BBS
software is used, interesting, but not very indicative of anything.
Nonetheless, PCBoard, TBBS, Wildcat!, and MajorBBS were quite predictably the
four top favorites.

As to the winners, the top 100 probably represents a much better cross
section of the BBS world than did last year's.  The top system received 1330
votes, but only 32 votes were required to make the list. Of the top 100
bulletin boards, the average line count was 25.41, skewed strongly by
Exec-PC's 280 lines and Canada Remote Systems'200 lines.  But while the
serious bulletin boards are clearly going to ever higher line counts, you
don't have to have hundreds of lines to make a showing among callers.  A
single line system, Eagle's Nest right here in Denver showed strongly at
number 20, and a four line system, Totem Pole, scored to number 13.
Actually, there were TWO single line systems in the top 100.

Adult and chat systems again dominated the list as a whole.  Our theory is
that the elements of community that make promotion in a contest of this sort
are much more easily found on these social interaction boards than on file
systems.  But in the top 10, file systems actually seemed to be the winners,
so the advantage is certainly not insurmountable. In fact the diversity is
pretty encouraging.  But the top four systems were all file systems and two
of the top 10 were totally free of charge and devoted to technical topics,
shareware, and files. Three of the top 10 were clearly adult in nature.

We did find it odd that four of the top 10 systems used totally custom
developed software for their services, and an additional system used a
product titled SHS that we had never before encountered.

FIRST PLACE - SOFTWARE CREATIONS - (508)368-7139

The top BBS in the Boardwatch 100 Readers' Choice Contest was Dan Linton's
Software Creations BBS in Clinton Massachusetts.  This system received 1330
votes.  The system started in December 1989 with one telephone line on a DTK
XT, a 2400 bps modem, and a 20 MB hard drive.  By the following October, the
system was up to 4 lines, using U.S. Robotics HST Dual Standard modems, a 386
MB hard drive, and a LANtastic network to tie the computers together under
PCBoard BBS software. With Linton's background in hardware design, the system
largely served as a technical information center for other local BBS
operators.

In March, 1991, Linton released his first shareware program, titled Picture
Puzzle.  The popularity of the system increased as it became known as the
home system of Picture Puzzle.  Linton entered into a relationship with
Apogee Software to serve as their support BBS and point of release for their
popular series of shareware game programs, including Commander Keene,
Wolfenstein, and others.  These programs have changed the perception of
shareware game software by providing graphics, sound, and strategy on par or
superior to commercial game software.  Other BBS operators and callers from
around the country to get the latest versions of this popular series for
their systems and Software Creations blossomed.

Today, Software Creations runs PCBOARD Version 15.0, Novell 3.11 local area
network, and services 83 incoming lines on 66 80386 40 MHz nodes, two 80486
33 MHz file servers, and a maintenance machine.  They currently claim some
2000 callers per day to access the 8 gigabytes of files.

The mission of the Software Creations BBS remains as a file board dedicated
to the development and distribution of shareware software.  They've become
the support/distribution system for other shareware software companies
including Id Software, Gamer's Edge, Epic MegaGames, Boxer Software,
ImagiSOFT, HomeBrew Software, and many others.  They've also developed a bit
of a following among those developing graphics screens, sound files, and
other expressive elements in the programming world.  Dan Linton, Software

SECOND PLACE - EXEC-PC  (414)789-4210

EXEC-PC, one of the nation's largest and oldest bulletin boards, placed
second in the Boardwatch 100 Readers' Choice BBS Contest with 1288 votes.
Exec-PC was established in 1983 as the first large BBS.  As such, it is one
of the longest running systems in the industry, and has recently grown to 280
telephone lines.

Guided by 10 years of interaction with the users, the custom software
designed by sysop Bob Mahoney is feature rich, and the operators are able to
quickly implement both serious, and even sometimes whimsical user
suggestions.  They currently claim to receive a staggering one million calls
every seven months and have become known for their "millionth" caller
milestone contest giveaways that were at one point almost annual but seem to
happen with increasing frequency.

Exec-PC is a primary distribution point for much of the shareware available
today, and many bulletin boards get much of their new files from Exec-PC.
Exec-PC actively welcomes sysops from all over the world and takes pride in
the fact that many stock their collections from Exec-PC's supply.  This
creates a distribution system whereby a shareware author can upload a new
file and have it distributed virtually worldwide within hours.  The system
receives over 5000 calls daily with some 200 new files uploaded by callers
each day.  Additionally, the system sports some 30 CD-ROM drives for a total
of over 650,000 files available online with a file search program unique in
the industry for its speed, interface, and the ability to search through more
than 15 gigabytes of files with a single command.

Although Exec-PC was rather militantly a "files board" for a number of years,
they have more recently added a pretty serious series of message areas
currently sporting over a half-million messages and it does accommodate .QWK
offline mail readers.  Additionally, they have added publication features
such as PC-Catalog, an online catalog listing personal computer equipment,
Espan Job Search, and we were most pleased to note, Boardwatch Online
Edition.  They also have a game titled Global War that has become quite
popular and currently have 50 of these interactive games in operation.

Exec-PC claims to be one of the "most generous bulletin boards in the world."
Subscriptions to the service are $75 per year or $25 per quarter and they
allow ten hours of access and 7 megabytes of downloads per week for this
subscription fee.  This is quite flexible for the caller as they can use the
entire allocation in a single day, or as they wish during the week.  The
system also sports X.25 connections via the CompuServe network and the Global
Access X.25 network.  The system is run by Bob and Tracey Mahoney.  They've
recently added staff to help run the system including Greg Ryan, author of
RyBBS.  Exec-PC, PO Box 57, Elm Grove, WI 53122; (414)789-4200 voice;
(414)789-4210 BBS.

THIRD PLACE - DELTACOMM BBS - (919)481-9399

deltaComm Development, Inc., is headed by Jeff Woods and currently markets
the communications program Telix.  They operate a 10-line BBS in Cary, North
Carolina using PCBoard version 15.0 and are our third place system with 973
ballots.  The system does provide online product support for Telix users, but
according to Jeff Woods, they also want to expand the BBS into a full-fledged
online service.  "We feel this system is unique in the mid-south," says
Woods, "offering high quality, high volume services at little or no cost.
We're very excited about its future."  He went on to state that the two
businesses, communications software, and the services that software is used
to contact, go hand in hand.  We couldn't agree more.

The system offers 4 gigabytes of online files and carries all conferences on
the RIME network and 99% of the FidoNet backbone (1:151/107). They plan to
add Internet mail this month. The system runs on an unusual Cubix Corp box
containing ten 486 PC slave cards under Novell 3.11.  As a result, it does
have 10 PCs built into a single case to serve 10 lines. Staffer Zack Jones
actually sysops the system. Jeffrey L. Woods, President, deltaComm
Development, Inc., PO Box 1185, Cary, NC 27512; (919)460-4556 voice;

FOURTH PLACE - PC-OHIO - (216)381-3320

Scoring in the fourth position in the Boardwatch 100 Readers' Choice BBS
Contest is Norm Henke's PC-OHIO BBS with 664 votes. Norm started PC-OHIO on
9/1/85 with one telephone line on a used TAVA XT clone in his bedroom. He
began with RBBS but switched to PCBoard within a few months. In 1986 he
expanded to three nodes and then to five nodes. It has grow to 40 486
computers in the basement all linked together thru an Ethernet network.

In 1991 Norm decided that since the BBS had grown so large he needed to work
full-time at home on the BBS. He is now a "professional" Sysop spending as
much as 12 hours a day working on the system. The work load has grown large
enough that now his wife, Joyce, has quit her job as a Registered Nurse and
is helping Norm full-time as an employee of PC-OHIO. PC-OHIO also recently
incorporating as PC-OHIO, Inc.

Norm bought a larger house this summer in neighboring Lyndhurst which has a
large carriage house on the property. They will be moving in the fall into
these larger facilities and expand PC-Ohio to 50 nodes. They will also be
adding a T1 connection to the Internet to provide high-speed full Internet
access.

He has been the Fidonet Region Echomail Coordinator (REC) for Region 11 (the
Midwest) and Net Echomail Coordinator (NEC) for Net 157 (Cleveland).

A resident of South Euclid, Ohio, Norm is 39 years old and has been married
to his wife Joyce for 17 years. They have a four year old son, Colin, and a
one and a half year old son named Ian. Norm's major non-computing interest is
science fiction. He has a collection of 3,000 paperback books. He is a big
fan of Doctor Who and Star Trek.

A founding member of the Greater Cleveland PC Users Group and a former
president, he is currently an advisor to the club board of directors.

PC-OHIO is connected to 22 email networks including the Internet as
pcohio.com. PC-OHIO has over 100,000 ZIP files. It contains over 15 gigabytes
of actual files. They use US Robotics HST Dual Standard 16800 bps modems on
all phone lines.

PC-OHIO has over 5,000 subscribers plus 300 visiting Sysops and about 1000
visitors who have limited privileges. It has contracts with two local user
groups to provide BBS services to their members.  Norm Henke, PC-OHIO, 23749

SIXTH PLACE - WESTSIDE - (213)933-4050

Scoring sixth in the contest with 407 votes is WESTSIDE, a popular west coast
social chat system.  Dave Harrison started Westside in Los Angeles in April,
1987 as a 2-line DLX board. Westside quickly grew and within the year moved
to 16 lines in an office on Wilshire Boulevard, serving as a popular social
chat service.

In August, 1991, the system changed to a proprietary software platform titled
Metropolis - the Online City, written in C by Walt Howard and running on the
QNX operating system.  The software was expandable to 250 lines allowing
Westside to grow to their current size of 132 lines serving some 7200 users.
The system sports a Sprintnet X.25 connection giving local access in over 800
cities at $9.95 for the first five hours and $2.10 per hour for additional
hours of access between 6 PM and 7 AM.  The plan expansion to some 200 lines
by the end of the year.

In addition to the expected chat function, the system also sports a file area
with some 25,000 .GIF images, 20,000 IBM and Windows shareware files, and
other files totaling 10 GB - none of it CD ROM.  They also carry publications
such as Boardwatch, EEEEK BITS, Hi Tech Home Weekly, The Underground
Informer, Carl Paul Daily Horoscopes, Frugal Gourmet, and many more.  They
are in the process of adding a service titled Sportscreen providing national
sports scores updated every 15 minutes.

Online games are also provided with such titles as Outburst, Trivia, and a
highly addictive stock portfolio trading game titled Portfolio.  The system
also claims that some 40 couples have met and wed on the service, and they've
received some 3.3 million calls since opening in 1987.  Westside, PO Box

SEVENTH PLACE - ALBUQUERQUE ROS - (505)299-5974

Scoring seventh in the Readers' Choice Contest with 378 ballots, the
Albuquerque ROS is a unique bulletin board system in many respects.  The
Sysop, Steve Fox, is also the author of the BBS software, ROS, which gives
FOX the flexibility and responsiveness that have made The Albuquerque ROS one
of the top boards in the country - without offering ANY "adult" material.
One local newspaper columnist says the Albuquerque ROS has a "grown up"
approach to doing things.  Fox simply says his orientation is technical and
that the user base has shown time and again that "adult" materials (pictures,
messages, chat, etc.) are not necessary.  Users like the fact that their
children are welcome to call and not be barraged by referrences to sexually
explicit material.

Running on a a 486DX33 Novell 3.11 file server, Fox uses Cubix multi-CPU
cards to provide a 14 line system with minimum interaction between nodes.
WIth 60,000 files on-line, the Albuquerque ROS is generally considered a
files board.  But with 4000 users, there is a very active social life with
multiuser games and message areas.  A recent addition to these forums is the
HOT area for "Hot topics and a little hot air."  User opinions on a wide
variety of topics have proven that while computer people may share a common
interest, they are also widely divergent in their thinking.  Topics discussed
have ranged from AIDS to Rush Limbaugh and from personal freedom to the
environment.  While the give and take sometimes gets heated, intelligent
argument always wins over name calling and finger pointing.

The Albuquerque ROS is New Mexico's longest continually operating BBS, online
since the state got electricity in 1984.  While subscriptions ($30 per year)
are encouraged to increas users daily time allowances and access to services,
the Albuquerque ROS has always been a free system.  The system provides 14
lines using Supra V.32bis 14,400 bps FAXmodems.  Steven Fox, Albuquerque ROS,

EIGHTH PLACE - ODYSSEY - (818)358-6968

In eighth place with 369 ballots is Odyssey Online.  Called "the largest
adult-based entertainment service in North America, and quite possibly the
world" but the ever-modest and self effacing General Manager Michael Allen,
Odyssey Online line is touted as the high-energy online spot "where adults
come to play."  Allen heads a team of five full-time employees and numerous
contractors that run what PC Computing Magazine terms a "Super BBS" grossing
over $1,500,000 annually.  Odyssey has been seen on NBC's "A Closer Look",
"Donohue", Time Magazine, and a number of computer-related publications.

The service started in 1988 on a single line, and went through several name
changes and line configurations before becoming Odyssey and reaching it's
current 118 line capacity.  The company has plans to expand to some 300 lines
in the future.  Odyssey is available via local numbers covering over 850
cities in the U.S., Canada, and throughout the world.

Odyssey's theme is "adult entertainment," a term that carries a stigma of
hardcore porn that some publications and online services have refused Odyssey
advertising that contains the word "adult" or "mature."  What "adult" mainly
means to Odyssey subscribers, however is "no kids", a simple concept to most
adults.

"Odyssey's real success is an alternative to the neighborhood bar or club",
states Allen, "where people relax and unwind after a hard day.  We're selling
people mixing with people," Allen continues, "all we're doing is giving them
a place - the Odyssey Platform - to do it."   Odyssey's typical user is a 32
year-old male or female professional with upper-middle income.

According to Allen, "Our market is adults with adults.  It's that simple.  If
you're looking for the latest esoteric software patch, you're probably not
going to find it with us.  But if you're looking for a place to express your
ideas in public or private, gaming with the best players in the country,
chatting through the night with new friends, or downloading the hottest image
files in the U.S., then the one place you should be is on Odyssey."

The adult image libraries claim to be one of the hottest file collections in
the country, and there are shareware libraries with over 70,000 titles for

NINTH PLACE - WIZARD'S GATE BBS - (614)224-1635

Scoring ninth in the contest with 339 votes, Joseph Balshone's Wizard's Gate
BBS operates in Columbus Ohio.  This is one of the most unique bulletin
boards you will encounter, run by a gentleman of apparently endless good
humor quite willing to experiment, and his callers have responded on his
behalf.  He's aided in operating the system by his "loyal sidekick", Loretta
Curry.

First, the BBS is free - quite in the spirit of the early days of BBSing.
You can't give them money.  There is no verification.  No validation.  And
you get 90 minutes on your first call, and you can call up to nine times per
day.  In theory, you can spend 13.5 hours per day on this BBS without paying
a dime.  Given the not inconsiderable expense of operating a 10 line BBS with
12 gigabytes of file storage, we're not sure how, or perhaps why he does it,
but the system is quite free of charge and those wishing to "donate" are
politely encouraged to send it to any other local BBS that probably needs it.

Secondly, it doesn't run ordinary BBS software.  The system is the flagship
beta tester for a software system titled SH Systems BBS Software, written by
Steve Harke of Battle Creek Michigan. We're still a little unclear as to
whether this software is actually released yet, but Balshone has been working
with Harke and the software for nearly four years now, and professes a great
love for this masterpiece in process.

Most uniquely, the software offers a COMMAND DOT PROCESSOR.  We're not sure
what that is, but what it does is allow you to insert commands within e-mail
messages themselves to perform such operations as CC, include files, change
sections, change topics, and so forth.  This seems like a terribly cunning
idea.

Wiz Gate was started in November, 1989.  Joseph Balshone, Wizard's Gate BBS,

TENTH PLACE - PLEASURE DOME BBS - (804)490-5878

Tom McElvy's Pleasure Dome BBS takes tenth place honors in the contest with
334 votes.  Running Wildcat! software, Pleasure Dome is located in Virginia
Beach, Virginia and is unabashedly adult in nature.  While the system does
eschew child pornography, bestiality, scanned magazine images, and other
"illegal" images, it is entirely devoted to sexual fantasies, desires, and
erotica.  The system provides chat service, an impressive collection of
erotic .GIF images, and carries message traffic from conferences such as
ThrobNet, Perverts Anonymous, Friends & Lovers, NixPix, RIME, KinkNet,
StudNet, FemNet, HotNet, SwingNet, GonzoNet, 18plus, LightNet, LampNet,
Global Village Net, PlayNet, WildNet, Voyager, and Late Night. They total
over 400 different adult conferences from these various networks. As they say
in their promotional literature, Pleasure Dome is a VERY friendly place.

One of the keys to the success of Pleasure Dome is that they have beaten the
male/female ratio extant online.  By providing free lines specifically to the
ladies, they have attracted a relatively large number of callers from the
female persuasion, and probably more than a few claiming to be.  In any
event, McElvey avows that approximately 33% of their callers are in fact
female, and the average user is 33 years old.  They offer Matchmaker and
Swingers classified ads online that are quite popular.

The system also offers HIV/AIDS information obtained directly from the
Department of Health updated on a daily basis.

The system was started in 1985 on a Commodore 64 with three 160 KB disk
drives and a single 300 baud modem.  Today, they sport 10 lines at 14,400
bps. Pleasure Dome, PO Box 12126, Norfolk, VA 23502; (804)473-1-SEX voice;
(804)490-LUST BBS.

As to the voters, they won't be forgotten either.  Representatives from ZyXEL
USA, Hayes Microcomputer Products, Inc., and U.S. Robotics will each draw two
names from the 20,200 ballots cast to award their top of the line modem
products.  The drawing will be held on Thursday, August 26th, 1993 at 1:00 PM
in Colorado Hall in the Broadmoor Hotel, during the ONE BBSCON.  We calculate
the odds of winning at one in 3367 - not bad for a free contest and a
high-speed modem from the blue. Voters need not be present to win.

The top 10 BBSs in the contest will each be awarded a genuine lucite pyramid
with cheap simulated walnut base and tin inscription plate trophy, a copy of
the Boardwatch 100 Readers' Choice BBS List, an advertisement in Boardwatch,
and our thanks for participating - at the same awards ceremony. BBS operators
DO need to be present to get any of that.  Like we said, this contest is for
callers.
