 OF GAMES AND THINGS
 -------------------

I would like to think of Boardwatch as a "real" magazine.  It isn't, and I
guess I would probably leave for greener pastures if it was, but it is
occasionally delicious to contemplate the concept of planning an issue months
in advance with a theme, articles, graphics, and watching it all come
together as planned.  This really is a fantasy.  The online world moves and
shakes with a speed, that the feigned attempt to keep up with it in a monthly
printed publication is probably folly anyway.  In our efforts to do so, it
always surprises me when an issue nears completion, to learn what the "theme"
was in this issue.  Without any particular planning, it appears that it is
online games this month.

Which is a bit odd since I avoid games for the most part.  Oh, I've tried.
Most recently I carefully gathered information about a fascinating group of
young men down in Texas who are doing a fantastic job of programming some
very engaging games.  They're called Apogee Software and the last time I
asked, they were doing about $300K per month with Shareware games.  I spoke
with the actual programmers, got a couple of review copies of their games,
and intended to write on the topic.

On return to Denver, I loaded their very popular Castle Wolfenstein on my
trusty, if aging 33 MHz 486 machine.  The game was very real.  If I moved the
mouse to the left, my view of the room moved to the left.  If I moved it to
the right, the room swam to the right.  On my machine the motion was very
quick, and very smooth.  Sure, I shot my share of Nazi's, but soon a sweat
broke out across the brow, a funny taste filled my mouth, and despite four
years on an aircraft carrier, the unmistakable queasiness of motion sickness
began to tug at me quite insistently.

I quit playing the game for a few minutes and got a cup of coffee.  I started
to feel better, and went back to play it again.  Within just a couple of
minutes I was ready to paint the NEC MultiSync with a kind of colorful
collage of my own - mostly reminiscent of lunch.

I had other misadventures years ago.  The early video games may have been
crude, but I was apparently cruder.  I would fire a game up on the old C-64
and when I looked up, it would be three days later.  There was something
empty about three days missing from your life with nothing but dead alien
invaders to show for it.

But the real heart of my "disconnect" from games was over Chess.  When I was
a very young man, we had an attempted college student name Harold board with
us for the semester or perhaps half of a second one it took him to discover
his true talents lied elsewhere.  At age seven, I became good friends with
Harold, largely owing to our similar intellectual development. Harold had a
chess board and fancied that if he could learn the game, things would go
better for him.  Perhaps it might have.  In the process, he taught me to
play, and I fell in love with the game.  For years I played at every
opportunity. While I fancied myself somewhat accomplished at it, it's a game
that's played on many levels and there is always someone a bit more
practiced.  I won some, and lost some, and continued to play more or less
casually into adulthood.

Some ten years ago I was still playing a bit now and then.  A friend and I
discovered a tavern with a beautiful large wooden chess set and a pretty good
English Ale.  And we were wont to play of an evening.

It was about that time that someone taught a computer to play chess.  I
dabbled with a game for the Apple II, and then encountered really a pretty
good one that ran on the Commodore-64.  Since the computer is always a
willing partner, I began playing against the PC.

What I discovered went beyond mere electronic masturbation.  The computer
played chess very differently from people.  The mathematics were all there,
in fact the computer could often beat me.  But the game was entirely
different.  I could battle for 30 minutes to go up a single piece, or gain a
single key vantage point.  At every turn it very logically tried to thwart my
efforts.  But if I really worked at it, I could gain the edge nearly every
time and at every level.

But something was missing.  After a 30 minute battle, with the piece taken or
the position secured, the computer didn't panic, it didn't "cave", it didn't
have to regroup. No panic counterattacks, anger, frustration, or lapse. It
was instantly renewing the game taking precise logical advantage of its
current position. It was as if the game were started anew, one piece down.
Win that piece, it started anew - another piece down.  It would battle to the
last pawn, one square at a time.  It was relentless even in loss.

After a few hundred games, it finally dawned on me that there was nobody
home.  The computer was playing a superb game, but the heart of it was
entirely devoid of life, of emotion.  It didn't care it lost.  It didn't
celebrate victories large or small.  It was starkly devoid of even the
faintest glimmer or spark of warmth.  Entirely cold. The computer was dead.

I don't know what I expected. But somehow it wasn't that. Chess can appear to
lend itself to this mathematical precision.  But that's not what chess is.
It's not even a simulation of chess. It is a mathematical parody of chess.
And I actually felt foolish for spending all that time with it.  The
experience not only soured me on computer games, but I don't guess I've
played chess since.

The hot number in this issue revolves around multi-player games.  These are
computer mediated games with the people put back in.  You can play arcade
shootem up games, card games, adventure games, and yes, chess, online any
time of the day or night, just like playing the computer, but you are
actually playing against other human beings at the other end of the line. You
can even chat with them in most cases while you play. It may be that the
graphics are improving, the speed is improving, and the virtual reality
valhalla is at hand.  But, while I think this is the beginning of a new
revival in gaming, the critical piece that has been missing is people.  When
you can sit in your own living room, bring your own chips, but still play
poker with your five buddies spread across four states, it becomes fun again.
With a little drammamine, I think I can ante into that.

 Dear Boardwatch,

In your Internet Notes of your March Issue you say "The system runs on a 14
processor Tandem CLX minicomputer with over 1500 public terminals, 16 dialup
lines operating at 2400 bps at (303) 758-1551 and free access via Internet
telnet login at pac.carl.org or 192.54.81.128". I had to read most of it
three or four times to realize that I couldn't access these resources via
Internet.

Please remember we don't all live in Colorado.

 Dan Westlake
 SMALL1@UTKVX.UTCC.UTK.EDU

 Dan:

Actually, I'm going to guess about 98% of us don't. But you may want to read
it once more through. Telnet pac.carl.org or Telnet 192.54.81.128 pretty much
gets you there from any place with wires - and from whatever continent you
prefer.

 Jack Rickard


 Jack:

Good intentions don't count! I've intended to write several times. Finally
had enough to say I guess. Brief intro: I run two 16-line DLX 5.5 BBS systems
in Minneapolis. I am converting from DLX to TBBS and excited about the
potential! I have been running multi-line BBS systems for the past 6 years.
I've been a Boardwatch reader the past two years.

Thanks for the magazine. I watch for it and read it cover to cover each
month. Your style is refreshing. The Lance Rose column on the Georgia sysop
(April) was interesting. I'm removing X-type gifs from my BBS. This has
provoked discussion. I mentioned this incident and received the attached
e-mail. I though you (and Lance) may find it of interest.

I thoroughly enjoyed last year's ONE BBSCON! I came away with more ideas,
contacts, merchandise and ideas than I ever imagined. Thanks for the vision
to make it happen. This year's convention has posed a dilemma however.

OUTlines BBS is for the gay community. While I don't march, don't carry a
purse and question the value of boycotts, the location is a sensitive issue
for many. I know sysops that won't (or feel they can't) attend because of the
location. I'm not a political animal and a political statement is not my
intent. My goal is to grow my systems so I can leave corporate life. I feel
ONE BBSCON essential to that effort!

Minnesota just added gays to the state's human rights amendment. The
Minneapolis city council has a "ban on travel" to Colorado for city
employees. I want (need) to network with peer systems. This weekend will be
the largest March on Washington ever. Where does all this leave a quiet shy
struggling sysop like me?

I'll attend. I've already made room reservations and paid my fee. I'll keep
my attendance quite from users and peers. I really don't expect any action
from you. I can appreciate your position. I do believe you to be a fair
person and I wanted to share this perspective with you.

 Respectfully,
 Terry Sovil.

 Terry:

I strain to view the world from that perspective, and given what you tell me,
it looks like a very complicated one to me. It's difficult to put myself in
your position, because most organized/activist groups, for whatever purpose,
strike me with a chord of humor, and a touch of disdain.

I believe in individuals - not groups. I suppose at a visceral level I
actually associate group behavior with cowardice, though I'm not certain why.
Whenever a group forms, it is usually to the detriment of an individual some
where, and it usually forms from mutual fears that in some magic way are
dispelled by "groupdom." If we have meetings, boycotts, et al, we will be
strong. Most of the "ugly" things I've seen of humanity come from groups, and
most of the moving heroism, charity, or compassion seems to come from
individuals. As a result, I'm not too sympathetic to groups organized to
accomplish anything. And I generally dismiss them out of hand after
extracting whatever humor/entertainment value they may contain.

Admittedly I oversimplify life, and life seems to let me get away with it.
But for many, the political and social scenario you paint is probably very
real, very complicated, and very hard to deal with. I wish you success in a
complicated world.

I suppose ONE BBSCON is a group. It forms for three days. It has no purpose
except to celebrate the online creation, swap technical and business tips,
and allow everyone to see across the fence to other applications, other
success stories, and even other failures. Perhaps review our history a bit.
It is intended as an annual cross pollination of the online community, to
battle the Balkanization that seems to occur. And I would hope that mutual
respect for individuals and their contribution to the online community as
individuals is what is celebrated. Your sexuality isn't an issue, and I would
prefer it not be one. We will likewise deal poorly with the economy, the
plight of the homeless, and the environment. We probably will deal with sex,
but more on the level of how to deal with x-rated GIF images.

Colorado has been ill served by events of the past year. I have found it to
be one of the more tolerant areas of the world in which to live, which is one
of the reasons I live here. And the disparity between the picture of Colorado
I see emerging from my TV and the picture I see out my window is at least
entertaining. There is a group within our local government bent on destroying
families. And there is a group down south that is anti-gay. But understand
that out of a state with a 3 million plus population, BOTH groups together
couldn't fill a Denny's restaurant. Most of the people here tend to be a
little on the individualistic side as well.

I find it unfortunate that you can be openly gay, but have to attend a
technical exposition "in the closet." I can assure you that you will be
welcomed at ONE BBSCON this year as last, and treated with respect as a BBS
operator, which in our "group" such as it is, is what you are. But I'm sure
there are others that face the same decision, and I can imagine it is not an
easy one. All we can do is hold the convention, and try to make sure that all
those that come leave with a bit more than they brought. Those that stay
home, stay home, and I hope they gain whatever it is they are after thereby.

 Jack Rickard


 Hi Jack.

Just checked out the April 93 boardwatch.. not bad! a lot of useful
information packed into a well-put-together magazine, albeit traditional..
(3-columns standard typefaces, etc). but the national bbs listing is nice {I
like the horizontal lay-out}..

I was wondering if you would consider devoting more pages to Internet stuff
and Internet related message bases/irc channels/telnet and FTP stuff.. I'm
sure the 10-15 million Internet users out there would appreciate it, as would
I.. I really liked Kevin Savetz' article on the Oracle; I just checked it out
today and am awaiting a response.. Few magazines are able to discuss
something and have the reader go out and do it right after reading aout it,
but this one has some practical things in it..

Anyway, keep up the good work, and I hope you consider my suggestion.

 Ciao for now.

 Dear Jeremy:

As you can see, we're getting a lot of mail about what we ought to be
covering more of. But the Internet certainly has my attention these days, and
I think you can count on more coverage of it as we go along. We have a pretty
neat piece on a NASA Shuttle photo database in this issue.

I'm going to guess there are a little over 4 million people actually ON the
Internet with sufficient IP connectivity to do telnet and ftp. Internet
people have a habit of subsuming everything they touch when touting
statistics. But it is a growing force that I think holds the seed for a
future of common connectivity. And we'll be covering it in some detail. One
of our main goals with each story is for our readers to be able to go contact
the service and find out for themselves.

 Jack Rickard


 Jack:

I really enjoy reading your magazine, but I see one major thing that it
lacks: Product Comparisons. I would think that a magazine about BBS's and
BBSing would have modem comparisons, BBS software comparisons or something
similar. Could you please explain to this new boardwatch'er why you don't
feature product comparisons?

 Max Campos

 Hello Jack,

Back again, after that keyboard slip with spastic fingers... No metaphysical
ravings this time... just a request for an article in Boardwatch to be
written by you. How about a comparative review of nearly all BBS packages
itemizing breadth of features, stability under fire, ease of configuration,
ease of customization by either programmer types or those without such
skills, etc. Perhaps such data could be arranged in tabular format and
therefore would not take too many pages. A bit of prose though-why did you
choose TBBS over PC Board for example for the Boardwatch BBS?  Etc.

Your continued editorial comments about harassment of BBS activities and
constitutional rights to free speech and free expression go right to the
heart of the matter. Keep it up. I do believe the constitution supports the
concept that "sticks and stones will break thy bones but words will never
harm thee"; outright calls to treason excepted. When the government decides
that massaging the psyche of its citizens is a political objective that might
contribute to the good of the state, we are seeing the 'dark' side of Marxism
disguised in its new clothing of 'politically correct'.

 Ben Blumenberg
 Reality Software

 Dear Ben and Max:

I know a number of computer publications that have made their mark with
product comparisons. But they generally cater to technically unsophisticated
corporate types who want easy answers, and the publishers basically make a
buck by giving them to them. I'm going to guess the level of readership of
Boardwatch magazine wouldn't let me get away with it.

Product comparisons are brutally hard work when done right, and so generally
it isn't. Any one person, or team, that reviews a series of programs does so
with a bias toward that with which they are familiar. Oh, you can spice up an
article with some gratuitous fair sounding statements, but that doesn't
really hide the problem except from the most naive readers. And at that, most
reviews you read are of fairly homogeneous categories - printer comparisons,
word processors, spreadsheets, DOS utilities.

But aside from personal view of comparisons as a journalistic scam, there are
several reasons we just don't do them. For one, they are tedious and lengthy.
If I'm bored, I assume my readers are.

Secondly, BBS software very closely approximates an online operating system.
What it does, and how it does it, is to a large degree a function of the
philosophy of the designer - what he thought it ought to do. We don't yet
have the common expectations as we do of what word processors should do, what
spreadsheets should do, or what database programs should do. A BBS system
that is quite the thing for running a successful chat BBS, will do many
things quite differently from one designed as a shareware library. Some offer
excellent compatibility for LANs, which can be a very legitimate need. Others
barely tolerate their presence. One system may be just the thing for FidoNet
connectivity, and another sees connectivity as a function of QWK offline
mail, or Internet connectivity. If you try to line up all the columns, there
are a lot of columns to line up.

Further, BBS systems do not operate in a vacuum. Again, they are somewhat
akin to special purpose operating systems. So they tend to have lots of other
things designed to work with them. Some of these packages have thirty or more
third party entities writing utilities and add-ons. At one point, we had a
BBS package that MOST of what people used it for was provided by a third
party developer. If a BBS system does NOT offer FidoNet connectivity at all,
but using a third party utility it does it SUPERBLY, then in a product
review, does it do it, or does it not?

Then there is the problem that at any given moment, half the packages have
just released new versions, and the other half are going to next week.
Whatever we might test, it is all different six weeks later.

PC Magazine, arguably one of the best sources of product reviews on the
planet, tackled this one nearly two years ago. They did it so badly I was
embarrassed for them, but they were so tied up with all the mail about
products they hadn't included, had gotten wrong, had the wrong version of, or
had otherwise maligned, that I'm sure they didn't notice my discomfort.
Essentially, they rushed in where Boardwatch feared to tread. And they can
have all of that they want. BBS callers and operators both are a pretty tough
crowd to snow.

The real problem is that the choice of BBS software has to be keyed very
closely to what you envision doing with a BBS. A system that's lousy at
presenting textual information or databases may be just the ticket for file
downloads or chat functions. There aren't any easy answers. You have to
define what you want to do, and then find the best product to do it. We can
note developments, new features, new releases, and new trends.

Why do we use TBBS? There are several pretty important reasons and a couple
of fairly trivial ones. It's entirely written in assembly language - and I
have a terrible and probably unfair bias in this respect. Originally hailing
from the hardware side of the world, I believe that a given microprocessor
sports precisely one language - the one the guy that designed the
microprocessor designed into it. Everything else is a compromise and usually
a fairly artless one at that.

TBBS presents text files very well and very flexibly, and obviously as a
publication that homes in on one of our main applications. I find that many
things I want a BBS to be somehow always come around to being a database one
way or another. eSoft has a TDBS expansion module that uses dBASE compatible
.DBF database files directly, and allows us to write programs in dBASE
language and compile them to make them available on multiple lines without a
lot of record locking and other housekeeping that dBASE itself requires.

The system can support up to 64 lines from a single 486 machine and allow
downloads at 14.4kbps on all 64 at the same time. It is in fact the only
software that can do that in the real world and I'm not exactly guessing
here. And it can do FidoNet mail sessions on some or all lines while also
serving other callers with the normal BBS presentation. As an accident of
history, we distribute a few online text products such as Boardwatch Online
Edition, Newsbytes, and Gannett's USA Today Newspaper to about 500 bulletin
boards world wide. About 80% of them retrieve these files using very
automated and unattended FidoNet file request functions and get a might
snarley if we aren't up and able when their system does the dirty deed to get
the news. We handle several hundred requests for USA Today alone each AM on
less than a dozen lines from a single machine that until thirty days ago was
a 386SX20 in a broom closet. At 14.4kbps, this 65kbps file takes less than a
minute to transfer, and we handle an awful lot of them within a two hour
period. We couldn't get a dozen machines on a LAN in the broom closet, and I
don't need the aggravation.

Finally, for a system such as ours, I think we need a pretty strong identity.
And philosophically, I think the BBS presentation should be a function of the
creative design vision of the BBS operator, not the BBS software designer.
TBBS lets us design menus in a very flexible hierarchy many levels both deep
and wide. It looks like the Boardwatch BBS, and like none other for good or
ill.

But I'm a bit fickle, and we'll drop it like a bad habit when we find one
better suited to what we're doing.

 Dear Jack:

Thank you for your letter confirming that I am registered for the ONE BBS
CON. Being the first BBS and SysOp of a FidoNet node in the Indian
subcontinent, I was keenly interested to attend this conference. As you would
appreciate, India is very very far away from the US and being just out of
college and only 24 years old, finance for this trip in terms of travel and
registration is a major constraint. However, having taken care of that
aspect, my main and only worry is a place to stay.

Since I shall be spending most of my time at the conference, basically all I
need is a place to sleep at night in a foreign land. Any accommodation on the
lines of a student exchange program or YMCA would be acceptable to me. If
there is any family close the venue who is willing put me up for the period
of the conference that would be just great. This would help me conserve on my
scarce monetary resource and give an opportunity for the US family concerned
to experience a whole new feeling.

I would be extremely grateful if anyone could help me in this regards.

We'll publish your letter and perhaps some Colorado Springs local resident

advice and assistance.

I look forward to meeting you in person at ONE BBSCON this August.

 Dear Jack,

I read with interest your comments on recycled paper in the latest
Boardwatch. You're obviously trying to do the right thing (e.g. use soy inks)
without Doing The Right Thing (jumping on a PC bandwagon). So I thought you
might be interested in knowing that the Audubon Society -- which generally
represents the more thoughtful, quiet, intellectual wing of the environmental
movement -- has been looking at recycled paper VERY seriously. The last 6
issues of Audubon (which is bimonthly) have each experimented, in part, with
a different recycled paper. They've been looking for paper that is
high-enough quality for a magazine that lives on photographs, and that is
GENUINELY easy on the environment. They've found several choices they seem to
think are worthwhile -- you might want to check it out.

 Nathaniel:

Actually I have a great deal of respect for the Audubon Society - and their
publication. And if we could find a recycled paper that actually saved more
than it consumed in recycling it, we would certainly consider it.

I don't suppose the Audubon Society sports a BBS?

 Jack Rickard


 Dear Jack,

I would like to start out by saying what a wonderful magazine you publish. It
is my favorite magazine to get in the mail every month! I would like to
mention that Don McKneely from Cape Girardeau on KFVS 12 is still doing the
weather today. I know you mentioned him a few months ago. And I would also
like to tell you that Telegard BBS is no longer supported. The author's name
is Marty Polland and he quit upgrading Telegard BBS about a year ago due to
circumstances beyond his control.

I was wondering, since you feature different cities in Boardwatch, if you
have ever considered featuring St. Louis, MO. St. Louis is home to over 300
BBSs. Most of our local boards are running Shareware programs, and are run by
hobbyists. We're a great city, and I hope you would consider us one day.
Thanks!

It's wonderful to hear that Don McKneely is still on the air at KFVS. He
pretty much has to encompass the entire development of television in his own
career. And of course, there is the famous Don McKneely career trivia
question - "tell us what Homer did?" For Boardwatch readers, Homer farted -
about thirty years ago - making local television history. I would imagine Don
still hears about it occasionally.

Sorry to hear Telegard is now officially an orphan. We get occasional
inquiries regarding the package, and have been a bit lost as to contact
information. It doesn't sound like we are going to get any better on that
front.

Actually, my first logon to a BBS was in the St. Louis area, and my own first
BBS list was of about 16 systems covering St. Louis and Belleville Illinois.
I lived in St. John, Missouri, a north county suburb, for five years and
served on the city council there for three years. I was in the McDonnell
Douglas computer club with several gentlemen who were quite excited about
this new Fidonet thing in 1984, but since I was pretty enmeshed in developing
software for Commodore 64 and Sinclair ZX-81 computers at the time, felt
rather left out of the party. I guess you can tell Ben Baker I'm more or less
caught up now.

Check out our list this month.  You've got a treasure in Fire Escape and
we're pleased to grant your request.

 Dear Jack:

I was reading your JUNE '93 issue of BoardWatch, and was Somewhat Suprised to
read the artical on page 26 in the SOFTWARE section about R.I.P Graphics by
TeleGrafix. To start things off I am an "Extremly Happy ROBOBOARD Sysop". The
Programing Firm S.H. GRAPHICS located in Ayl., Canada developed a Grapical
User Interface (GUI) System for the use of communications.

It started about 2 1/2 years ago when the founder (Seth Hamilton) made a
comment about making a GUI BBS, they laughed at him! Well he didnt take it
and sit back down he continued to work on the GUI System despite the negative
feedbacks. Well about 1 year later he had developed a functional ProtoType
called ROBO Board (ROBO). Today this system is being used in almost every
major city around the WORLD. The way ROBO utilizes the GUI is most fasinating
in that it accualy Directly Writes 85% of the High Power graphics directly to
the screen! The other 15% are ICONS which are Downloaded and Decompressed
automatically in less than a second. The ICONs Are roughly .2k in size.

Right now you are probaly thinking this must be slow, well acually its quite
FAST. In most cases its Seemingly faster than ANSI. Well it achives the
DIRECT SCREEN WRITES by a Emulation Protocal That Seth Hamilton Developed
called ROBO100, which is so used by his FREEWARE terminal called ROBOterm,
which can be used for all ASCII,ANSI, and ROBO systems Utilizing X,Y,Z,and
Rmodem. Rmodem is somewhat close to Zmodem in efficiency execpt instead of 1k
blocks it sends up to 4k blocks, faster than the y Zmodem does. You can Log
onto any ROBOboard and Not have to manually update the graphics or worry
about the last BBS's Graphics at all, ROBO updates them as needed. Also With
ROBO the Graphics Drawing Program it uses, ROBOdraw, It's very easy for ev
the First time artist to use, even for Detailed Graphics. The whole package
to get RoboBoard up and Running is Right at $55. You can see What I am
talking about by dialing into the systems Listed Below...

 Dear Jack,

Thanks for "being there" and helping me to make my BBS the best I can figure
out how to make it. Without Boardwatch, it would still be a two line MajorBBS
system with no Fidonet, no Internet, and no BirdNet echos sent around the
country, and no fun. Not that it's finished, mind you! Now I'm looking at
PIMP for even faster moving of Internet mail.

Just a couple of things I've had on my mind...

In the May 1992 issue, you had an article on "The Profitable Bulletin Board,
A Sense of Place." In it you said, " Community is the sum of the individuals
there and is crucial to the value of a system. It's worthy of its own article
and we'll cover it in a future issue."

I've been looking for a continuation of this article ever since then! When
might you get to it?

I was a little disconcerted with your comments in the June 1993 issue
regarding "eco-activists". I guess I had always hoped you had a better view
of changing the planet and preserving what's left. I'm not an activist by any
means, but I fear that without the activists, nothing would ever get "fixed".
You're right though, they do have the same fervor/fever in their eyes that
the religous zealots have, and those I have no use for. I like your statement
"there is some legitimacy in the old scout edict to leave your campsite at
least as clean as you found it." If we all did that, then the eco-activists
would have nothing to complain about. Alas, that's not going to happen.

Lastly, I read Boardwatch as my bible. I can live without the monthly list of
BBS in other locations, but I couldn't live without your editorial and
letters to the editor! You're an inpiration to THIS budding sysop!

 Sincerely,
 Terry Rune
 System Operator Bird Info Network Arvada, CO

 Terry:

Glad to hear you are enjoying some success with the Bird Info Network. You're
quite right, we should probably do more on the Profitable BBS, and the
community building aspect does seem to be a common thread on the really
successful boards. The project has not been entirely dormant, but admittedly
not in print.

I've rather artlessly cajoled John Coates and Cliff Figallo into preparing a
presentation at ONE BBSCON on precisely this subject. John and Cliff ran The
Whole Earth Lectronic Link (THE WELL) for most all of its formative years.
THE WELL is virtually a pure play on this community concept. They had no
features, no interface, no performance, and no file areas on a pretty
gruesome UNIXish system that wasn't all that good when it was new. And it's
not new. But it did have some very powerful conferencing features that are
still hard to equal. And they built the system almost ENTIRELY on community.
If any of us can learn to do what they did, with some of the niceties of life
common on any bulletin board system available today, it has to be an instant
formula for success however you measure it. I rather thought they would be
more qualified to detail the nuts and bolts of keeping your mind while
dealing with 5000 egos online than I am. Don't miss this session at ONE
BBSCON in August.

As to the planet, I think there is a lot left, and I AM a little concerned
about changing it. I'm reluctant to. Most of our efforts to play whist with
Mother Nature have not historically led to a good outcome. You can shovel
cane toads out of Australia or try to deal with Smokey The Bear's problematic
legacy in our forest lands if you like. From controlling coyote's (rabbits
three feet deep across Texas), to trying African bees in South America, we
have an uncanny knack for meaning well. I'm suspicious of "pop" science in
general, and frankly utterly horrified at the prostitution of our genuine
scientific community with the grant money/politically correct spiral deal
with the devil they've either wandered into or been forced into - I can't
tell which. But we are approaching ground zero on ever getting an answer
again not tainted by political impact and "activist" agenda.  I think it will
pass, but I fear we'll all wind up knee deep in cane toads with no air
conditioning by the time it does.

 Jack Rickard


 Dear Jack:

Just read your editorial concerning "Clinton White House's new connectivity."

Just because the president can get his message directly to the people without
the "filter" of the press may not actually give him more clout. Add to that
the ability of the people to have their own discussion group(s) on the
"National Information Infrastructure" and the additional "clout" actually
goes to the *people*.

We are told in school that an *informed electorate* leads to good government.
The more the voters actually pay attention and discuss the issues, the better
our government. Many feel that the biggest barrier to good government is the
short attention span of the voters. That may be so, but the networks rarely
give us enough information to draw our own conclusions, only data to support
THEIR conclusion (for example, "Dan Quail is a fool, here is what he has done
now ...") I think if the voters get the unfiltered promises and opinions of
their elected representatives though E-mail, they may actually expect more
from their government. For example, are we expecting too much to expect our
president to at least try to keep *some* of his campaign promises?

Notice how much time people spend (waste?) discussing sports. Opinion seems
well informed. Why? Because everyone is able to watch the entire game and
form their own opinion. If they could only watch a portion of the game, and
only the portion the sports journalists decided to show them, you would soon
notice "the man on the street" losing interest and displaying an uninformed
opinion about sports. Unfiltered information is always helpful.

Frankly I have never felt that the network journalists in Washington were
doing any favor for me when they provided cynical commentary. We should have
term limitations for these folks as much as the congress.

You are right about our electronic wiseacres, George Will, Rush Limbaugh,
etc. But we will soon have amateur commentators on the political discussion
news conferences who may actually be better. We will broaden the wiseacre
bandwidth.

It is my hope that with more complete political data on the "National
Information Infrastructure" our government *will improve*. I do not expect
this to lead to "government controlled news medium."

 John Vindekilde

 John:

I have to agree with a number of your points. The network journalists
generally did a poor job, but they were the only viable counterpoint in the
information game. I personally find my daily feed from the White House
enormously informative, and it is after all what we've said for years should
be done. Microtimes Columnist Jim Warren has taken a leading role in calling
for open government by electronic means, and I think there is a lot of
sentiment in that direction.

I was trying to point out the other, and perhaps non-obvious side of the
coin. Diluting the concentration of reporting power by spreading it across
more channels and more commentators, while enhancing the information control
of the Presidency, does in fact alter the information power structure and to
my way of thinking, in favor of the government. And full text pronouncements
from the White House do NOT assure an informed electorate. They assure an
electorate in receipt of information. Governments, ours included I fear, have
routinely and historically presented information to their advantage, and
suppressed information that is not. If the "news" is defined by what the
President says it is, to a larger degree than we enjoy today, I think that
has some drawbacks.

It may have some pluses as well. Certainly if it lifts debate to full text
from sound bite level, that would be a positive thing. And for many of those
few genetically equipped for the painful process of thought, the availability
of this information is an immediate blessing. Counterforces rising from the
online proletariat? One can hope so. But broadening the wiseacre bandwidth is
precisely the problem. It was the CONCENTRATION of wiseacre power that made
it a force for our leaders to contend with - often to their considerable
irritation and frustration. I confess I don't really have a clue what it
means ultimately. But it will be different. And I thought it worthwhile that
during the thrill of electronic access, we consider the ways in which it
might in fact be different.

 Dear Jack:

Three years ago, while flat on my back recovering from an accident, a friend
loaned me a Vendex 8088 (Old even then!), manuals, printer, uninstalled
internal modem, a Prodigy start-up kit and a copy of the July 1991 BOARDWATCH
(That issue became my bible within a few months!). And my life changed
forever.

Struggling to grasp the "It's Greek to me" concepts presented in what I now
realize were extremely well written manuals, for weeks I lay prone, keyboard
on my tummy, monitor crowded on the nightstand, and two cats dive-bombing in
and out of everything! Daily I plowed onward, cursing my clumsy fingers and
otherwise swift mind as it turned to mush. Forgetting to sleep or eat for
weeks on end, I lived primarily on Jelly Bellies, M&M's, cold pizza, and warm
Cokes.

Using a salad knife (Who hadda screwdriver?), I cracked the case (See how
fast I picked up the jargon?) on the 8088 and following my friend's
handwritten instructions, installed the modem. When a tiny screw dropped into
the open case, I used a magnet to retrieve it (Whaddid *I* know?). Cranking
up the computer, I logged onto Prodigy.

The first month I was thrilled at my discovery! Then, as the realization of
their extensive censorship and hidden costs hit me, I turned to that copy of
BOARDWATCH to find some other board to logon to.

OHMAGOD! There was TONS of boards listed there. By evening, I had logged onto
four and canceled Prodigy! It was heaven as I popped Extra Strength Tylenol
for my bad back and typed twenty hours a day, stopping only for physical
therapy. My mind was spinning, bombarded with new things every moment! I
frantically attempted to stay out of chat long enough to find my way 'round
the 32 line systems. I soon had any number of friends from the boards! My
back felt lousy, but I was having the time of my life!

Which brings me to today... I have my own 16 line TBBS board, BLAZIN' BYTES,
(818-776-2777) <if that is permitted>, and I am an avid BOARDWATCH fan. Every
issue is read and re-read! As a busy sysop I forget to eat and sleep for
weeks on end and live primarily on Jelly Bellies, M&M's, cold pizza and warm
Cokes (SOME things don't change!). My back still hurts like hell and I should
own stock in Tylenol! My mom thinks I'm an "OP-OP," and says "Barbie
dear...when are you going to get a REAL job?" (When I don't work my board 20
hours a day, mom!) My two daughters think I finally HAVE learned to speak
Greek! GAWD! I LOVE THIS JOB!!!

Thanks to you and your staff for contributing so much to my life and career,
Jack. And thanks to the terrific gang of sysops and staff at eSoft for their
warm support, too! (Buncha nut-cases, every one!) I'm making my reservations
for BBSCON and look forward to meeting all of ya!

 Barbara Mallut <aka Blazin' Barb>

P.S. Now WHY do I feel guilty for not having a string of letters, numbers and
symbols listed here under my name? Hmmmm....

 Blazin'Barb@Nuttin'here! <Smile>

 Barb:

And there, in seven paragraphs, lies the gist of so many many things I
struggle to convey every day of my life. It hasn't really got very much to do
with computers, does it Barb? If you can wield a salad knife, that's about
all the technical acumen required. It is the injured, and the meek. And the
old. And those trapped in dreary jobs they detest. It's the isolated. And the
broken. The disillusioned. The cynical. The abandoned and the embittered. The
impatient. The creative. The lonely. The intelligent. A spark of contact. A
link forged painfully in the night. One. And then two. And then two thousand.
And then two million. And now twelve million. Like fireflies in the night
winking in and winking out in fiery lances of hidden light spanning
continents - perhaps a world. Minds in contact from anywhere and everywhere.
Without their broken limbs, their palsy, their loneliness, and their assorted
damage and detritus of the miles of life. Freed of both geography, and time,
they are replaced with joy, and stimulation, and a sense of intellectual and
conversational freedom. The walls recede and the sound fades. We are
somewhere bigger, and there are others. Lots of others. It is in a most
genuine sense a world made over.

I don't know what it means. Faster modems, younger computers, older
passwords, and more whiskey - maybe. But it is this change of life, this
coming of age that I see repeated with magic a dozen or so times a year -
individuals remade by discovery of another world. I can listen to a hundred
demand that I cover their 1982 model 12 custom CP/M machine and give it the
"respect it deserves," and listen to another hundred vendors demand that I
make people call them with money without actually fainting from boredom
because somewhere in the piles and piles of what we do, there is a letter
from someone who "got it." Yes, I love this job too Blazin'Barb.

And now back to the nuts and bolts. Remind me NOT to stop by for dinner.
Jelly Bellies?

We can get you fixed up with a name and funny characters and stop that guilt
thing dead in its tracks via an Internet host account from Holonet or
Colorado SuperNet and a copy of a software program titled PIMP to hook that
16 line TBBS up to do Internet mail. Finally, I am most pleased to learn
we'll meet you in person at ONE BBSCON in August. The world needs more people
willing to take this thing head on with nothing more than a salad knife, a
concerned mother, and a bottle of Tylenol.

 INTERESTING NUMBERS
 -------------------

Theodore Barry & Associates, with Economics and Technology, Inc., recently
did a survey of some 1000 residential consumers to determine demand for
computers, modems, and commercial online services in New York State. The
results are interesting.

With regards to computers, the survey found that 31.0% of those polled
currently own a personal computer at home and an additional 16.2% intend to
purchase one within the next two years. By 1995, 47.2% of households will
have personal computers.

Approximately 14.2% of those polled currently own modems and an additional
8.8% intend to purchase within the next two years. This would indicate that
nearly 45.8% of those owning personal computers now have modems.

Some 7.1% of those polled currently use online services and 5.4% intend to
add online services within the next two years.

We thought it interesting to apply these numbers to current population data
for the United States as a whole. It would appear there are currently 96.5
million households in the United States. This would result in some 29.915
million homes with PCs now, growing to 45.548 million by 1995 - a growth of
some 15.5 million households over the next two years.

It would result in some 13.7 million households with modems at home, growing
to 22.2 million over the next two years.

 ONE BBSCON '93 - Report from the Front
 --------------------------------------
 by Phil Becker

Blowout! There is no other word I know that can describe what happened at ONE
BBSCON '92 (and this one understates it a bit). Since recovering from that
event last August, everyone who attended has been trying to imagine what ONE
BBSCON '93 would be like. Could it possibly be bigger? Could it possibly be
better? Could I possibly feel this good about BBSing again? Eight months
later the answer is starting to shape up, and it is a resounding yes!

The few complaints we had about ONE BBSCON '92 fell into three categories. 1)
We had to turn vendors away - be sure the next one can hold them all. 2) We
had to turn people away - be sure the next one can hold them all. 3) The
hotel was great, but we were stuck in it for four days - get a location that
is near the mountains and let us get outdoors enough to enjoy the beauty of
Colorado.

So we set out to fix these "problems". The site for ONE BBSCON '93 is the
Broadmoor Hotel at the base of Pike's Peak mountain. This is the most
beautiful part of Colorado. Just standing outdoors anywhere in the area makes
you feel glad you are alive. We've arranged the show layout to give you ample
excuses to walk outside by the lake, trees, wildlife and mountains all day
long as you move between the sessions and the exhibit area.

We nearly tripled the vendor floor space, but that doesn't look like it will
be quite enough. Already it is well over 2/3 sold out and we may end up
turning vendors away again. We doubled the meeting capacity from 1,000
attendees to 2,000 attendees but it looks like we will sell those slots out
again too (if registration follows last year's curve we are headed for over
2,500 who will want to sign up). Jack and I are currently devising the
torture methods for the next person who says "those are the kind of problems
to have!"

"But is it worth my time and money to come?" you ask. My answer is that
frankly, if you have any interest in knowing about the online world and don't
attend ONE BBSCON '93, you've blown it. You will miss out on many things you
will not be able to learn in the entire following year. There is simply no
other way to obtain this much information about the online world.

There will be well over 120 hours of seminar material on every facet of the
online "sport". This assures that you can select a full three days of
sessions you are interested in and still miss most of it - no lightweight
time here! With over 25,000 sq. ft. of vendor floor (last year's show had
8,000 sq. ft.) you will be able to see more hands on demonstrations of BBS
and online software and hardware than have ever been assembled before. You
will not have another opportunity to compare software and hardware side by
side like this for another year.

But probably the most valuable part of the show is the evening "schmooz time"
when you can talk to others about your ideas. Maybe you've been wondering if
a particular program or hardware approach is worth your investment of time
and money. If so, come look at it in person on the vendor floor. Attend
sessions by those who made the product so you can understand how it works.
Then, as you walk around the lake in the evening with the sysops you ran into
who use that product, you can learn the parts you really need to know! With
over 1500 active sysops at ONE BBSCON '93, you can be certain that there will
be several present who have used or are using the products you care about.

There is simply no way to describe the value of this personal networking that
happens at ONE BBSCON. Hundreds of users of every type of BBS software and
hardware will be there. There is nowhere else in the world where everywhere
you turn you can talk to people who are interested in what you are doing. No
matter what subject you are trying to find out about in the online world, you
will find several people there who have already done what you are looking at
doing. You can ask those who have tried each of the methods you are
considering how it worked out for them. This research alone is simply not
available at any price anywhere else! And you will have access to the people
who design and build these products that is simply not available at any other
time.

Did I mention luminaries? ONE BBSCON '93 will have hundreds of people each of
whom would be the star attraction at any other event. The people who make the
online world go in every area (BBS software, Internet, BBS networking, modem
makers, commercial online providers, etc.) will be there. The creator of
nearly every part of the technology we use every day will be there. You'll
never get to see so many of the people who make it happen online in one place
anywhere else.

If last year is any indication, ONE BBSCON will also offer you significant
"buying opportunities". In two days last year over $250,000 in merchandise
was sold on the exhibit floor. Vendors offered show specials that made "going
home without it" impossible for many items. This year the vendor floor will
be much larger and it seems likely you will have many more opportunities to
buy at those "show special" prices.

But for me the most exciting part of ONE BBSCON is the way people discover
new ideas they never thought of before they came. Nearly everyone will leave
with at least one "new vision" of some part of their interaction with the
online world that they NEVER would have had without attending ONE BBSCON.
There is something magic that happens when this many active users of online
technology get together and just talk about what they are doing. I call it
"bull shooting as an act of discovery", and the outcome is simply amazing.
The air literally crackles with the energy of the exchange and growth of
ideas this interaction causes. Watching the people who came knowing
everything anyone knew about each part of the online technology interact and
create new knowledge on the spot is feeling I cannot describe. At ONE BBSCON

 HAYES CUTS OPTIMA 144 +144 FAX PRICE TO $179 FOR SYSOPS
 -------------------------------------------------------

Just as we were going to press with the July issue, Hayes Microcomputer
Products of Norcross Georgia released a May 24 announcement of dramatic price
cuts of up to 48% on their modems, and particularly stunning decreases for
qualifying bulletin board operators.  This constitutes the most dramatic
price cut in modems we've ever witnessed.

U.S. Robotics last month cut pricing across their entire Sportster line and
this month on their WorldPort models.  This is taking on all the aspects of a
modem price war - with high quality, high speed iron taking a dive into sub
$200 waters.

Most notably, Hayes dropped the sysop price on their popular OPTIMA 144
+FAX144 to a record $179 from $299 (40% cut).  The ULTRA 144 model got the
biggest percentage cut decreasing to $249 from the previous $499 - a drop of
a little over 50%.  And the company has even offered their ISDN PC Adapter
and ISDN System Adapter, each of which carry a list price of $1199, at a
sysop price of $450 - down from $650.

The OPTIMA 144 model particularly was already getting very high marks in the
BBS community at the $299 discount price Hayes offered to BBS operators.  The
modem has proven a solid performer with extremely few operational quirks and
offers good connections to a wide variety of caller modems.

While these price cuts signal a very competitive time ahead for modem
manufacturers, the consumer market has heated up significantly this year for
all personal computer products and modems in particular as more people go
online.  With high-speed modems suddenly and rather dramatically less
expensive, record unit sales volume levels are almost unavoidable.

The other element of note with regards to the Hayes sysop program is that
they have announced expansion of the program globally.  Commerce Department
export controls on high speed modems had hampered international availability
of sysop modem discount programs in the past. There had been extensive
deliberations within the past few months as to whether to drop the
restrictions entirely. Apparently the decision was favorable as Hayes is
offering the program to BBS operators worldwide.

"We are always looking for ways in which to provide the sysop community with
the best technology available, in both hardware and software products, at
affordable prices," said Hayes President Dennis C. Hayes.  "Smartcom for
Windows, our newest communications package, allows sysops the ability to
develop their own custom interfaces with its built-in powerful scripting
capability."

And apparently they are finding ways.  One of the most dramatic elements of
the announcement was the notice that BBS operators could order modems with
SAME DAY SHIPMENT on orders received by 3:00 PM EST.  To a community
accustomed to waiting up to 12 weeks on modem orders, this sounds too good to
be true.

Additionally, Hayes announced a cooperative program for marketing their new
Smartcom for Windows terminal program.  For each copy of the program ordered
by bulletin board users through their registered Hayes sysop at $49, Hayes
will rebate $5 to the BBS operator.

BBS operators interested in the program can get more information from the
Online With Hayes support system at (404)446-6336 or by calling Becky Smith
at (404)840-9200. The program continues through September 30.


 TELEBIT 14.4kbps QBLAZER
 ------------------------

In our April 1992 issue, we raved about an unusual modem from Telebit titled
the QBlazer. This cube shaped pocket rocket weighed less than a copy of
Boardwatch, when Boardwatch was a bit slimmer than it is now, and delivered
9600 bps data connections for the laptop crowd in pretty good style.

Since that time there have been a lot of product introductions of diminutive
size and better speed. The 9600 bps delivered by the little black cube isn't
so impressive any more, but we still like lugging the little thing around.

This month, Telebit announced the QBlazer Plus - an upgraded version of the
same basic package. The new version ups the data rate to 14,400 bps V.32bis,
and adds a 9600 bps V.29 fax function. With V.42/42bis error correction and
data compression, the cube now sports a serial port speed of up to 57,600
bps. Telebit claims it is the only transportable modem offering both
Macintosh and Windows communications software.

The new QBlazer Plus is available immediately at a price of $599 and features
a two-year warranty. BBS operators can qualify for a discounted price of
$299. The company recently changed their support BBS telephone number to
(408)745-3861. The BBS has full information on the BBS operator discount
program. Telebit Corporation, 1315 Chesapeake Terrace, Sunnyvale, CA 94089;

 U.S. ROBOTICS ANNOUNCES 14.4K PCMCIA MODEMS
 -------------------------------------------

The Personal Computer Mermory Card International Association (PCMCIA) bus
standard has caught on in a pretty big way - particularly among laptop
computers. Hewlett Packard has just announced the successor to the HP-95LX
with the HP-100LX featuring PCMCIA slots. These slots allow the addition of
memory, ethernet connectors, modems, or other peripherals built in a tiny
credit card size package that plugs into the slot via a 68-pin connector. The
market for PCMCIA fax/data modems is expected to grow to nearly 3.4 million
units by 1995.

U.S. Robotics has announced a 14.4kbps V.32bis modem with fax capabilities
built to this PCMCIA specification that can be plugged into this slot in the
HP-100LX or other laptops, which increasing feature the slots.

The new modem is PCMCIA type II compatible - about 5mm thick. It is titled
the WorldPort 14,400 Fax/Data PCMCIA 2.0 and it is priced at $649. It
includes both 14,400 CCITT v.32bis data and 14,400 bps CCITT V.17 fax
capabilities in a tiny package. The new entry is the result of U.S. Robotic's
acquisition of Suresnes, France-based P.N.B., s.a., which began shipping
PCMCIA products last year.

One of the problems with PCMCIA modems is that they are so tiny, how do you
put an RJ-11 jack for interface to the telephone system that is physically
sturdy enough to withstand connections. The key element to the WorldPort
model is what USR terms "Smart Data Access Arrangement" or "Smart DAA". This
uses an adapter with a slim plug that connects to the card, and a fairly
sturdy RJ-11 jack at the end of a short cable. The advantage here is that the
company has a whole series of these adapters. The card-end plug is the same,
but the RJ-11 end can be any type of connector used in any country. This
makes the WorldPort ideal for international work. The "smart" part of it is,
by selecting a different adapter, this also signals the modem to use the
initialization appropriate for that country.

The new WordPort is available in June, with an HST dual standard model
planned for shipment in July.

U.S. Robotics has made news recently with dramatic prize cuts across their
Sportster line. In May, USR announced similar price cuts for the WorldPort
series of portable modems by as much as 30% on some models. The WorldPort
14,400 Fax/Data modem was dropped from $649 down to $469. The same model for
the Apple PowerBook was lowered from $699 to $499. The data only WorldPort
14,400 was dropped from $599 to $439.

On April 26, USR announced record sales and earnings for the second quarter
ended April 2, 1993. Revenues for the quarter were $38.5 million, an increase
of 38% over the $27.9 million for the same quarter of the previous year. Net
earnings were also up 40% to $3.7 million from $2.7 million for the same
quarter of fiscal 1992. Earnings per share for the quarter totaled $0.31 on
11,994,000 weighted average shares outstanding.

Revenues for the six month period were $71.5 million, up from $52.9 million.

"We continue to benefit from our strategies for growth and expansion," said
Casey Cowell, U.S. Robotics chairman, president, and CEO. "This record
quarter is the product of several factors, among them continued revenue
growth of high-speed modem products and the initial shipments of new LAN
access products. Network management systems have continued their strong
growth trend complementing our desktop modem products. In addition,
international sales for the quarter reached a record $14.2 million." U.S.

 WINNIPEG RAID SHUTS DOWN EIGHT BULLETIN BOARDS
 ----------------------------------------------

The war against online pornography has spread internationally, and seems to
be spreading downward to smaller and smaller bulletin boards. Most of the
attention in the past has been lavished on larger bulletin boards such as
Rusty & Edie's 124 line BBS (copyright infringement), and Joey Jay's 32-line
Offworld BBS (pornography).

But evidence is mounting that an even more sinister campaign may be going on
across the country involving smaller bulletin boards who are offered the
following deal" "We keep your equipment, you say NOTHING about this to
anyone, and we won't press charges." Fearing the $30,000 plus expense of even
a successful defense, BBS operators are simply disappearing down the gaping
maw of a legal system run amuck in their efforts to "clean up" the online
community.

On May 20, the Winnipeg Regional Police in Canada's Manitoba Province served
search warrants on eight local bulletin boards accused of distributing
pornography online. All equipment was seized and the systems shut down.
According to Sgt. Dennis Loupin, the raids were the result of a lengthy
investigation where the police subscribed to the bulletin boards, gained
their trust, and downloaded files containing graphical depictions of sexual
acts and bestiality.

Terry Jonasson was one of those shut down. Jonasson operated a small 4 line
TBBS system in Winnipeg for the past two years. It ran on two 386 PCs with
1.5 GB of files and a couple of CD-ROMS.

Terry attends school in the mornings. After class on May 20, he lunched with
a classmate, and dialed his BBS from his classmate's home to retrieve a file.
The BBS failed to answer.

Jonasson rushed home to see what the problem was - assuming some unusual
technical difficulty. The search warrant was left on the kitchen table. He
rushed to the basement to find the place in a shambles. Not only the BBS, but
two other PCs, his voice answering machine, and inexplicably, an electric
drill were seized. "They even took my copy of Lance Rose's SYSLAW book,"
noted Jonasson. "I hope they read it."

The "crime" in Jonasson's case seems to be distribution of files from an
off-the-shelf CD ROM titled "So Much StareWare," a GIF-based title playing
off the success of the "So Much ShareWare" CD by the same company. And
according to Jonasson, the CD has some indecent images of nudity, but none of
the bestiality or sex act depictions or other obscenity even under the
somewhat more stringent Canadian obscenity standards. Nonetheless, Jonasson
was advised by his attorney that it would cost about $30,000 to defend the
case - and according to Jonasson, that is out of the question. Guilty or
innocent, he's essentially guilty of not having the $30,000.

And despite his assertion, the Winnipeg police apparently did do some
homework beforehand, dialing the systems, subscribing to them, and
downloading the files. Specific files were named in the warrant including
BIRRA.ZIP, SUCK.ZIP, OBSESSED.ZIP, FOURWAY.ZIP, DOUBLETAKE.ZIP and
FELLES.ZIP. The focus seemed to be on animated image sequences, and these
were pretty graphic. The warrant didn't actually mention the electric drill
specifically.

Canada R2L 1G2; (204)668-9725 voice; (204)667-0899 BBS (currently down).

With the proliferation of CD-ROM drives, many BBS operators are running as
many as a dozen of these drives from a single BBS containing Gigabytes of
files. Using off-the-shelf CD-ROM titles does not appear to be a "safe"
strategy for online sex anyway. Reviewing each program on each 600 MB CD
should provide hours of fun for BBS operators everywhere.


 DEALING WITH ADULT .GIF IMAGES
 ------------------------------
 By Greg Ryan, Co-Sysop, Exec-PC BBS

Exec-PC has taken a stance on copyright infringement of adult images. This
article will declare our policies regarding said images and propose a
standard way to evaluate newly uploaded pictures. In addition, Exec-PC was
recently approached by a major adult magazine who applauded and agreed with
our new policy.

This topic will be a roundtable discussion at the One BBSCON meeting in
August of 1993.

The following is a bulletin that we have posted on Exec-PC:

Exec-PC is the largest bulletin board in the country and often other sysops
look to us for guidance on current bbs related issues. One of the problems we
sysops face right now is safeguarding ourselves against litigation arising
from copyright infringement. We at Exec-PC have decided to take a pro-active
approach to the situation instead of just waiting for the lawyer's knock at
the door.

After viewing thousands of files, Exec-PC has decided it is impossible to
determine the origins and legality of many adult files. We have not
personally had time to read any adult magazines for quite a few years.
Suffice to say that to know exactly which pictures came from the various
adult publications, we would need to memorize every single issue of all
available adult magazines. A monumental job!

We have tried and tried, but have not found any consistent tests to determine
if a file came from a copyrighted magazine. Can you look for a copyright or
logo symbol in the pictures? Absolutely not. Can you look for filenames or
descriptions to get a good ID on a file? Not consistently, but we give some
good hints later in this article.

Even more shocking - we think there are still some people out there
digitizing copyrighted pictures and distributing them! Don't people ever
learn? If you are a sysop, do not assume that people creating the digitized
pictures are following all the rules. It is not a prudent way to treat the
situation.

Now that Exec-PC has given up on any easy tests for origins of pictures, here
are the initial guidelines we offer you. Please send us updates to this info,
we will post it on Exec. Someone has to do it or the marketplace will be a
mess!

(By the way, will someone, be it the government, some attorney, somebody with
greater knowledge on this topic, please give us sysops some professional
guidelines? Our's were created after we met with someone who is more familiar
with magazines in the marketplace. We had him give us examples of their
artistic styles and type of pictures and we deduced the rest).

The following are blanket recommendations. You will certainly delete too much
with these guidelines, but you will probably catch most of the questionable
files.

WHAT TO DELETE:

(This applies only to images where you do NOT know who holds the copyright.)

a) Pictures that seem too professional. Do a check of reasonableness - does
this look like a $20,000 model posing in a $200,000 set. Is it very clear,
professionally airbrushed, perfectly lighted with no shadows and not a single
imperfection? Don't know who created it? Delete it.

b) Pictures that are of relatively good-to-perfect quality that are R-rated,
not X-rated. R-rated pictures seem to be the copyright problem area. An
informal rule-of-thumb is that if you see any clear details in the lower body
area, you probably don't have to delete it. Otherwise, if you don't know who
created it, delete it.

c) Modern day celebrities in professional nude pictures. How likely is it
that Fred's BBS On the Corner can afford to pay the Tooltime girl or Vanna
White to pose in his basement studio? Not likely. Delete it. These pictures
often fit into the aforementioned b) category of excellent quality R-rated
pictures.

d) Are the persons in the photo more attractive and perfect than you could
imagine any genetic good fortune or stroke of luck or work of God could
create? You don't know who digitized it? Delete it. Since a perfect picture
can end up blurry when digitized, it's frequently true that even a poor
resolution picture of an extremely attractive person will be an infringement.

Again, if the pictures are excellent and the holder of the copyright allows
dissemination of his or her files, it should be ok to post them.

We are not absolutely sure about the following files, but some of them seem
to fail the basic tests we invented above:

EXEC-PC ADVISES THAT YOU DELETE THE FOLLOWING FILES:

 LADYR*.GIF files
 BABE*.GIF files
 DS-F*.GIF files
 GES*.GIF files
 NLR*.GIF files
 L-BUF, L-UND, etc., files
 LH*.GIF files
 HT*.GIF files
 MS*.GIF files
 GL-PB*.GIF files
 GL-R*.GIF files
 Godfather files - GF-*.GIF, GFINS, GFGOD, etc.
 VANNA files
 LATOYA or JACKSON files
 TOOLTIME files
 PRISM Files
 Garlique Pictures
 MaxiPics
 DataShack Pictures
 Price is Right files
 BAYWATCH files
 ELENIAK files
 BARBI files
 Sports Illustrated pictures
 Inside Sports pictures
 Jessica Hahn pictures
 Lato pictures
 Vanity pictures
 BREE pictures

Check out files with PIC imbedded in the filename. Files with
PLAYBOY,PB,PLAYMATE or PENTHOUSE in their name or description Check out files
that say BUNNY anywhere. If you don't see a cute little rabbit in the picture
you probably don't want that one.

Ironically, it's the R-Rated pictures that are the most dangerous. The racier
the picture, generally the safer it is to post. This attitude may change as
the Adult GIF industry shakes itself out.

Aside from the copyright issue there are some other pictures that should also
be deleted.

Are potentially underage persons or animals involved? Why take a chance? Just
delete them immediately.

That's it for now. We invite you to upload other hints to the adult file
collection on Exec-PC, or tell us about it in a message. We will add the
information to this bulletin as we receive it.

If anybody has advice on how to make this job easier we're all ears. For
right now, though, we are going through our entire .GIF collection and
deleting any potential infringers. Any new uploads are screened in a similar
fashion.

A last word of caution. The fact that you have adult CD-ROM's on-line just
means that you have that many more .GIF's to examine. In our experience, most
adult CD's have, at least, some files that need to be excluded. Be careful!

We are trying to lead the industry by setting a good example of how to follow
the laws as they develop, and how to show the proper respect for the work of
others. WE URGE ALL SYSOPS TO FOLLOW OUR EXAMPLE!

 SOFTWARE NOTES
 ==============

 PCBOARD VERSION 15.0 RELEASED
 -----------------------------

Clark Development Company has released version 15.0 of their popular PCBoard
BBS software into "wide area" beta testing - allowing current registered
users of the software to download and test the program prior to final
production and shipping of the product. This may be the most "improved"
version of PCBoard ever released.

The most prominent new feature of version 15.0 is the addition of an optional
PCBoard Programming Language that essentially allows the sysop to "extend"
the basic BBS design by attaching a PPL program to any prompt, input line, or
command that a caller encounters. By using PPL and the new optional menuing
system, the SysOp can create sub-menus for the main menu as well as for any
file area or bulletin menu. This opens up the PCBoard interface to be the
creative expression of the BBS operator, and provides a powerful tool for
designing more custom PCBoard systems.

Also with version 15.0, PCBoard has joined Galacticomm, Mustang, Searchlight,
and others on the RIPship. The new version supports the Remote Imaging
Protocol (RIP) described in our June issue. Using RIPaint, operators can
create graphical RIP menus employing real-time graphics, and a mouse
interface to navigate the board.

The new version also addresses the previously weak chat function of PCBoard.
Earlier versions were line oriented, requiring the caller to enter a complete
line of text which was then "sent" to the other callers. The new Node Chat
function allows callers to select a channel from 256 available, and each
character is echoed to the group as it is typed. This new "real time" chat
function allows both public and private chat channels and supports aliases.

Additionally, the new version includes more serious support for international
languages and character sets, including 2-byte character sets such as those
used in Japan and China.

The message function of PCBoard has been dramatically improved. Addressing
has been expanded to accommodate longer Internet type addresses by expanding
the previous 25 character TO and FROM fields to 120 characters. Messages can
be uploaded using any available file transfer protocol. Messages can have
attached files that callers can send to each other via private message.
Carbon-copy and return receipt functions have been added.

According to David W. Terry, Director of Programming at Clark Development,
"Although almost a year in development, I think our customers will appreciate
the wait after they see the new features which will be available to them in
version 15.0. Basically, our goal has been to make PCBoard the most flexible
and comprehensive BBS software package available from any source. With the
new PPL, along with the many other enhancements to the software, it is
possible to set up PCBoard on virtually any hardware platform and configure
it to do virtually anything the SysOp wants - including the building of
extensive menus and sub-menus, RIPscrip operation, "intelligent scripts,"
operation with almost ANY intelligent serial card, establishment of an
extensive real-time node chat board, etc. My feeling is that if PCBoard v
15.0 can't do what a Sysop wants to do, most likely they will not find the
capability to do it in any other software on the market today at any price!"

The new product will go into shipment  in mid-June with a 2 node package
priced at $170, 10 nodes at $340, 100 nodes at $680, 250 nodes at $1000, and
1000 node version at $2500, plus shipping and handling. The new PPL compiler
will be priced at $80.

Clark Development has also recently established an Internet presence through
a connection with Holonet (800-638-4656). Sales questions are answered from
SALES@CLARKDEV .COM and technical support questions from
SUPPORT@CLARKDEV.COM. Additionally, CDC has created a Usenet newsgroup for
PCBoard sysops to use as a forum for discussion of their software that is
echoed directly to the Salt Air support BBS in Murray, Utah. The new
newsgroup is alt.bbs.pcboard. Clark Development Company, Inc., 3950 South 700
East, Suite 303, Murray, UT 84107; (801)261-1686 voice; (801)261-8987 fax;

 FRACTERM -- A VISION OF THE FUTURE FOR THE ON-LINE WORLD
 --------------------------------------------------------
 By Jim Thompson
 Western News Service

The days of the "text only" BBS are rapidly receding. High resolution color
monitors, fast video display cards and high speed modems have cut a clear
path to the future of the on-line world. It is a world of high resolution,
full-color photographs and graphics and, in the not distant future, full
motion video.

In this, the second installment in my journal on the quest for capturing,
displaying and transferring high quality, color images electronically, I will
look at one method of displaying those images in an on-line environment.

Fracterm by Imagen, Inc., in Vancouver, BC provides a complete approach to
image compression and display for the BBS operator. Using Fractal
compression, an outgrowth of chaos mathematics, this is the first intelligent
approach to the many problems associated with the compressing and
decompressing of high quality images.

The actual compression method was developed by Iterated Systems, Inc. and
licensed to Imagen, Inc. for use in their Fracterm package. Explaining
fractal compression is not an easy task. Iterated Systems, Inc. describes the
term fractal as, "a broken structure possessing similar looking forms of many
different sizes. Fractals are infinitely magnifiable, resolution-independent
patters that can be described by small finite sets of instructions."

Basically, a fractal is a mathematical algorithm from which an image can be
created. A fractal formula generates a fractal picture which is composed of
an image based upon a basic pattern. It is this ability to create a larger
picture from a small subset of data that allows for the creation of a
complete image from a very small data set.

According to Iterated Systems, Inc., "The belief that images are made of
fractals led Michael Barnsley to the discovery of the `Fractal Transform,'
which automates the reduction of images to fractal formulas. This provides a
highly compact file structure from which the original image can be
reconstructed with remarkable accuracy."

Indeed, despite the extremely small size of the fractrally compressed image,
the quality is remarkable. Compression can be done with hardware or with
Fracterm's software package.

Although not a standard, fractal compression is rapidly gaining acceptance.
Presently, the most popular compression algorithm for photos is Jpeg (Joint
Photographic Expert System). Jpeg provides excellent compression, but is not
capable of the ultra-high compression of the fractal technology.

Also, fractal image compression is "resolution independent." If you want to
display an image on a larger monitor (for example, a 19-inch display) the
fractal image will expand to fill the entire screen without the need to
increase the file size of the image. This is not the case with Jpeg
compression.

"Resolution independence means that as hardware gets bigger and faster, the
size of the fractal image will remain the same. With Jpeg, an image could
grow as much as four times in order to fill a display," says Dwight Jones,
CEO of Imagen, Inc. and developer of the Fracterm package.

Additionally, fractal compression allows for "resolution enhancement" -- a
process in which "fractal prediction" is used to create additional detail
within an image.

The one drawback with fractal compression is that it works only with images
of a limited size (640x480). If you are working with a large, high resolution
image, you must first transform it to a lower resolution before compression.
This is not a difficult process (both Aldus PhotoStyler and Adobe PhotoShop
can handle this transformation easily) but is one additional step. Jpeg is
not limited in this aspect and can compress images of any size or quality.

Although Imagen, Inc., advertises their product as providing "real time
graphics for a BBS," this is not technically true. The program actually
provides the ability to dramatically compress an image so it can be quickly
downloaded into the callers terminal program. Depending on the size of the
compressed image, this download process can take only a matter of seconds.

The result is that to the caller it appears that the images are being
displayed in "real time." Actually, they are downloaded images that are
decompressed and displayed on the local machine. Fracterm works with TBBS, PC
Board, Wildcat! or any BBS capable of Zmodem transfers.

The Fracterm software package consists of four elements or modules. Let's
take a look at each.

IMAGE COMPRESSION MODULE

From the Sysops point-of-view, this is the heart of the Fracterm system. This
is the program that compresses the original images so they can be posted for
"on-line viewing." Both a DOS and a Windows version of the software are
available.

The DOS version has been offered for some time, the Windows version has been
in development for several months and in beta testing since late March.

Both programs provide the same features and abilities and the same
limitations. To use either programs you will need at least a 386/SX computer
with at least four megabytes of RAM. The DOS version will compress 24-bit TGA
files with a size of 640x480 or smaller. The Windows version compresses both
TGA and BMP files with the same size limitation. Any other file type or size
will be rejected by the compression program.

In both versions, you can select the speed of compression and the ultimate
size of the file. Higher speeds and smaller file sizes come at the cost of
quality.

The speed can be set at a factor from one (slowest) to four (fastest). The
size of the compressed image can vary from 5k (lowest quality) to 80k
(highest quality). Your actual choice of the speed/quality variables will
determine not only the quality of the image and the compression time but,
ultimately, the speed at which it will be transferred to the callers on your
BBS.

The compression speed can vary significantly. The major deciding factors are
the CPU of your computer, the amount of available RAM and the settings
selected in the compression program.

I tested both the DOS and Windows versions of the program on two mchines -- a
386/33 with 16 megabytes of RAM and a 486/SX with 8 megabytes of RAM, neither
has a math co-processor. I did not find a significant difference between the
compression times on these two machines. For our purposes here, all quoted
times are based on the 486/SX with 8 megabytes of RAM since this is likely a
more typical configuration.

Although a spokesman for the company told me that it can take 30 or 40
minutes to compress an image if I am using a machine without a math
co-processor, I did not find this to be the case. In fact, the compression
times were significantly below this. Here is what my tests revealed:

Original File Size: 715k

 COMPRESSED FILE SIZE: 15k
 (ratio 47:1) (transfer time @ 9600 baud:

 Speed Setting   Time
 ------------------------------------------
 4 (fastest)     2 min. 20 sec.
 3               2 min. 47 sec.
 2               8 min. 20 sec.
 1 (slowest)     13 min. 42 sec.



 COMPRESSED FILE SIZE: 20k
 (ration 35:1) transfer  time @ 9600 baud:

 ------------------------------------------

 2               11 min. 10 sec.
 1 (slowest)     20 min. 49 sec.


 COMPRESSED FILE SIZE: 25k
 (ration 28:1) transfer  time @ 9600 baud:

 Speed Setting   Time
 ------------------------------------------
 4 (fastest)     2 min. 47 sec.
 3               4 min. 16 sec.
 2               11 min. 06 sec.
 1 (slowest)     19 min. 29 sec.


The more an image is compressed, the less the quality. Lines in a highly
compressed image lose their distinctiveness and become very jagged. In some
cases, the image looks as though it was created with mosaic tiles. Flesh
tones can appear as though they have been painted with oils.

The Windows compression program allows you to select the various options from
a menu. You can specify exact settings for size and speed or select "quality
over speed" or speed over quality" and let the program decide on the best
settings for you. If you have the time, the ideal is to compress the images
to about 8-10k in size using the highest quality. This allows for high
quality with the fastest possible download time. The result is the true
appearance of "real time graphics."

For the DOS program, you will have to specify your settings on the command
line. The advantage here is that you can run the whole thing from a batch
file. This is very handy when you have a number of images you want to
compress -- just set up the batch file which lists the images, specifies
quality and speed, then start it running and walk away. Some Sysops use this
approach to compress images overnight. When they arrive in the morning, the
images are ready to be posted on the BBS.

For faster compression, Imagen, Inc. offers several hardware solutions.
According to Iterated Systems, Inc., which manufacturers the half-card sized
board, the FTC-3 compression card reduces compression time from "at least
three times" to "up to ten times." Dwight Jones tells me he compresses files
with the board down to 8k in size in about a minute using the second to best
quality setting (quality over speed). The cost of the FTC-3 compression board
is $990.

Iterated also makes a more sophisticated board selling for $9,000. This card
will handle still images up to 4000x4000 and can compress video.

I have not seen a demonstration of either of these boards, so I cannot verify
this information. I will try to take a closer look in a future article.

FRACTERM BBS UPDATE MODULE (FRACBBS)

This portion of the Fracterm package consists of a utility program for
updating and adding items to the menu which contain the images available for
viewing. The program allows you to create the menu file (CONFIG.BBS) from
which images are selected.

In actual operation, the CONFIG.BBS file is downloaded to the caller
immediately after he/she enters the fractal image viewing area. The
CONFIG.BBS file is actually a menu of the items available in this section. By
having this file on the local machine, moving through the menu structure is
both easy and fast. Also, it remains available after the caller disconnects
from the host, so previously downloaded images can be viewed again.

The BBS Update Module also links to both a viewer and a text editor of your
choice. The text editor allows you to enter any amount of text to accompany a
given image. The viewer allows you to view the images while you are preparing
your menus. This viewer can also be used independently of the update module
to display fractal images from DOS.

When Fracterm was first offered, both this program and the compression module
were copy protected via a hardware device connected to the parallel port of
your computer (dongle). All copy protection has now been eliminated from all
portions of the program. This is certainly good news for all Sysops and makes
the program much more attractive.

FRACTERM TERMINAL MODULE

Just as the compression program can be considered the heart of the system for
the Sysop, the Fracterm Terminal module is the heart of the program for the
caller. This program allows the caller to access and view the compressed
images. Registered purchasers of the program are granted a license to freely
distribute the program to their users. A DOS and a Windows version are
available.

Both the DOS and the Windows versions are essentially the same in that they
are composed of a standard communications program for dialing and connecting
and a decompression program for viewing the images.

The DOS version was the original. It is a barebones terminal program
featuring a dialing directory, basic COM settings, Zmodem upload and download
ability, fractal decompression engine and viewer.

It is very easy to use, just select the BBS you want to call from the dialing
directory via a highlight bar, press Return and the program dials. Once
connected, you will need to fill in your name and password manually since
there is no script or logon language available.

You can enter your password (and only your password) in the dialing directory
and enter it by pressing Ctrl-F10. However, this is normally not easier than
just enter the word yourself. Also, since the password is not hidden, it
means that it can be seen by anyone looking at your dialing directory -- not
very secure if several people share one machine.

Another drawback to the DOS version is that it is necessary to load a device
driver before it will work properly. The drivers will work only with specific
VGA cards and chip sets. As of this writing only the following VGA adapters
are supported:

 ATI VGA Wonder series
 Tseng 3000 (eg Orchid Prodesigner)
 Tseng 4000 (eg Pixel Turbo)
 Paradise
 Trident 8900

If you don't have one of these cards or a card with the appropriate chip set
then forget about using the terminal program. It does work with other cards,
but expect strange things to happen when you try to view the images. Image,
Inc. is working on this and expect to have more drivers available in the near
future.

If you have the correct VGA setup, the program works perfectly. After
connecting to the host and entering the fractal viewing area, you are
presented with a tastefully designed viewing area consisting of an image
frame in the upper left half of the screen, control buttons to the right and
an area for menus or text in the lower half.

An indicator bar registers the status of the download of the images. If your
compressed images are from 10k-20k, and you are using a high speed modem, the
download takes only a matter of seconds. Not only is the image received, but
any accompanying text is also available. Once received, you can zoom the
image to full screen and switch between images. The images, text and menus
remain available for viewing even after you disconnect from the host system.

As noted, if you have the proper video setup, the program works perfectly,
but it is still not without its problems. Creating a terminal program can be
an endless task. It seems that there is always something new to add. As a
freeware program, no one expects it to compete with commercial program, but
there are some minimum requirements that should be addressed.

At the very least, any terminal program should have the ability to open or
close a capture file -- how else can you capture your mail when calling a
system? It should also have a rudimentary script language -- even if this
consists only of such statements as, "wait," "reply" and "disconnect."
Fracterm does not have these features, but according to Image's Dwight Jones,
these concerns are being addressed and will be available in future releases
of the program.

The Windows terminal program is a real pleasure to use. Although it is still
in the early stages of development, it is already blossoming into a first
rate program. It will never take the place of Procomm, Crosstalk Mark 4, or
any of the many full-featured commercial terminal programs, but when it comes
to capturing and viewing fractal images, it's great.

This program is down-right fun to use. Once you connect to the host and enter
the fractal image area of the BBS, a whole new world of graphics and color
open. The downloading of the menu file (CONFIG.BBS) adds a new option to the
menu bar along the top called "Area." Selecting this reveals the menu and
sub-menus indicating the images that are available.

The downloading of those images is smooth and fast. Once acquired, the images
and accompanying text are placed in individual windows which can be moved
around the screen, re-sized or reduced to icons. I must admit, having several
full color images on the screen at once and having the ability and freedom to
arrange them is a real kick.

It certainly gives you a feeling for the ultimate future of the on-line
world. If you have not tried this, you should.

In addition to decompressing fractal images, the current version of the
Windows terminal program allows downloads using Zmodem, Xmodem, Ymodem and
Kermit. Upload facilities using the same protocols and an off-line viewer
should be available by the time this article is published.

However, like the DOS version, Fracterm's Windows version is not without it
shortcomings. There is no capture file ability, no script language and only
basic functions. But the program does deliver on its ability to download and
display full color images -- not a bad trick in itself. Also, since it is
running under Windows, there are no problems with VGA hardware. If you can
run Windows, you can run this program.

Unfortunately, there is no terminal program available for the Macintosh. I
see this as a major stumbling block to having this technology become a
standard for on-line image transmission. Presently, the majority of the
newspapers and magazines, many of the largest corporations and most
educational organizations have standardized on the Macintosh for image
manipulation. Unless, this segment of the computer world is allowed to use
this technology, fractal imaging and compression will never become widely
accepted. As I see it, the race is on for the establishment of a standard. It
is a marathon, to be sure, but to the winner will go all the glory and gold.

As I say, this is a technology that is full of promise. Although the Windows
version has only just been released and is still in its development stages,
already Imagen, Inc. is working on a new, enhanced version called Fracterm
Pro for Windows. This program promises TCP/IP connectivity for Internet
access, links to databases and mail systems, built-in fractal image
compression, Jpeg decompression and viewers for TIFF, PCX, TGA and other
popular image types.

It will likely be some time before the new Pro version is available.
Meanwhile, they are working hard on getting the little bugs out of the
present version. According to Dwight Jones, "Imagen, Inc. is committed to
addressing any problems as quickly as possible and often that means the
frequent release of new versions."

Indeed, it seems they release a new version every few weeks. While this is
admirable, it often results in frustration since each new version has to be
tested and then distributed or made available by a Sysop to his/her users.

On the plus side, it points up the enthusiasm and commitment they have to
this technology. Imagen, Inc. (formally Cardz) had a bit of a rocky start,
but have since reorganized and now appear to be on the verge of starting a
minor revolution in the on-line community.

We plan to integrate Fractal compression technology into the Marlboro Racing
News Computer System and will be using it during our inaugural electronic
photo transmissions from the Indianapolis 500.

Of course, there are other systems that offer the promise of on-line photo
display and I will take a look at them in upcoming columns.

The Fracterm Package includes both the DOS and Windows versions of the
compression program, the off-line viewer, menu maintenance program, and the
DOS and Windows Terminal programs which can be distributed at no cost to your
users. The cost is $700 for an 8-line license, $1,300 for a 16-line license,
$2,000 for a 32-line license and $3,000 for a 64-line system.

Right now, Imagen, Inc. is offering an introductory special 2-line license
for $99. Under this program, Imagen, Inc. will upload the program to you and
give you full use of it for three months. If you decide it is for you, the
full price applies. No refunds or credits are offered under this plan.

 ESOFT ANNOUNCES INTERCHANGE PROGRAM FOR TBBS
 --------------------------------------------

eSoft, Inc. has begun beta test of a new option module program for their TBBS
multiline BBS software program titled Interchange. Interchange turns the
normal BBS transaction of dialing IN to the BBS around by allowing the system
to seize an available telephone line and dial OUT to other systems much after
the fashion of a terminal program - either from the console or in an
automated fashion using a script language.

The utility of this is deceptive. Quite obviously, the BBS operator can dial
out while leaving his system up serving callers on other lines. And of
course, the system could be automated to dial out and retrieve a specific
text file or whatever from another system on a schedule. But scripts can also
be tied to menu items. Item 7 on a menu, for example, could cause the system
to dial another local BBS or online service - a local library card catalog
such as the Colorado Alliance of Research Libraries here in Denver for
example. In this way, other systems could actually be menued from a single
BBS. You could put an entire local list of bulletin boards up on menus for
access by your callers.

One of the primary applications is to use TBBS as a dial-in front end for
larger mainframe databases. The act of connecting to the main frame and
calling up a particular database can be scripted and put on a TBBS menu -
where the mainframe database function looks like just another TBBS menu
entry.

But it may go beyond even that. One of the advantages of TBBS is that it has
its own multitasker built into it - you can run up to 64 lines on a single
PC. But one of the disadvantages of this is that it is essentially a "closed"
system - you can't run other DOS programs for callers in the fashion many
other BBS packages do - usually termed DOORS. There is no way to "shell out"
to run another DOS program.

eSoft has fought this disadvantage fairly admirably with their database
option module (The Data Base System - TDBS) by  allowing the community to
write applications in the dBASE development language and compile them as part
of the BBS. In this way, you can do custom programs, and in fact a thriving
third party market comprised of people developing and selling an assortment
of game and utility programs written in dBASE has emerged. It has opened up
the platform. But for some applications, there is a genuine need to run some
existing DOS program or utility.

Interchange can put another computer on the menu. By connecting to another PC
through a null modem cable and putting the option on a menu, callers can in
fact "shell out" to another computer to run DOORS, or any other application
for that matter. The script language can create any DOORS.SYS file necessary
to run any existing door program from the application server machine. In
theory, Interchange allows TBBS to add a series of "application servers"
connected by serial cable to make available to callers. This opens the
platform a fairly enormous step further.

The script language is powerful enough to be analogous to script languages on
any terminal program, including X,Y,ZMODEM file transfer protocols. One
innovative element is query screens that can be put up on the system allowing
callers to enter data that is then passed to the script as insertion
parameters for the actual dialing process.

The result has been very nearly a contest within eSoft to develop the most
ridiculous applications for Interchange. Currently, about half the
programming staff have the BBS dial them voice or on their pagers to get up
in the morning. One of them actually has a BSR appliance controller hooked up
to the modem. The BBS dials the controller to start the coffee pot, and
fifteen minutes later dials the voice phone to wake him up. They've done some
experiments with dialing a terminal and "delivering" files via ZMODEM.

The program is currently in beta test and officially scheduled for release
this July 1 at a price of $149.95.

Unofficially, eSoft has been busy with development of another project
heretofore referred to only as "secret stuff." But the rumor mill has
produced some details. With TBBS running multiple lines from a single system,
it by rights should be a pretty persuasive chat system - allowing callers to
type conversations to each other in real time. And there have been a few
systems operate as chat services by dint of an act of will on the part of the
BBS operator. But the TBBS chat functions, while adequately impressive
performance wise, have largely been viewed as very "basic" and not terribly
friendly.

And according to TBBS developer Phil Becker, there is a good reason for that.
By his own admission, he doesn't really grasp the nuances of chat. And the
growing market for social chat systems has been dominated by Galacticomm's
Major BBS, DLX, and Oracomm. So eSoft has apparently decided to concede
defeat on the interface and just adopt them all. An option module
unofficially termed UltraChat will not only allow a TBBS to look like a Major
BBS, a DLX, or an Oracomm, but actually each CALLER can pick which interface
they want to use to interact with other callers, many of whom may be using a
DIFFERENT interface.

More interestingly, it would appear that some parts of Interchange made it
into UltraChat. Becker thinks he can engineer an UltraChat link allowing TBBS
operators to easily and automatically link up to 1000 TBBS systems all over
the country for chat with up to 64,000 callers having simultaneous access to
all chat areas of all the boards. This is not a common "channel" - but the
full chat functionality of the entire system - linked 1000 times. Two
callers, each on entirely different BBSs separated by a continent, could meet
each other in group chat and set up a private chat on the side. Insiders at
eSoft think the growing demand for chat services is such that this could
bring them a couple of hundred additional installations almost immediately.

UltraChat is tentatively scheduled for an August 1 release at a price of
$195.

 SPECTRE - MULTI-PLAYER GAME FOR MODEMS AND LANs
 -----------------------------------------------
 by Alan Bryant

The concept of playing games by modem is hardly new. One of my earliest
contacts with the idea was a flight simulator game, barely more technically
advanced than "Pong," which ran on Tandy's Color Computer 2. The "planes"
were hardly more significant than crosshairs flying around on a red and blue
screen, the action was jerky, and you nearly always got nailed before you
even saw your opponent. Thankfully, technology has advanced just a bit since
then, and many current game software titles offer "modem link-ups" so you can
shoot your best friend out of the sky, blow-up his bases, or sink his ships;
but most of these games are designed more for single player use, with two
players by modem being an afterthought. Velocity's Spectre, on the other
hand, is an addicting game that can only be appreciated when you hook-up with
other players in a competitive environment.

At its core, Spectre is a "tank" game. You maneuver the tank around a finite
square playing field, moving around obstacles. Your goal is to pick-up all
the flags which are peppered around the playing field before time runs out.
When you've collected all the flags, you move to the next level, complete
with more obstacles and less time to accomplish your goal. When played
single-user, higher levels also have enemy tanks shooting at you. Simply
running away from them doesn't work especially well; when you reach the outer
limits of the playing field, you'll find yourself bumping against an
invisible wall.

In a single-player environment, Spectre quickly grows old. Its overall
concept is much like that of the early Atari arcade hit "Battlezone," and
Spectre's graphics are almost as primitive. Although obstacles and
backgrounds are interesting high-res images, the tanks and other elements are
simplistic and low-resolution, presumably to maintain fast performance when
the game is played multi-user.

And multi-user play is where Spectre is downright addictive. The game offers
four different types of multi-user play: modem and null modem direct connects
for two players, plus Novell IPX and NetBIOS support for a virtually
unlimited number of simultaneous players in a LAN environment. There's
nothing quite like you and your co-workers forgoing work for awhile blasting
each other to bits from your LAN workstations.

We tested Spectre under Novell 3.11 using IPX mode, and three of us raised
our blood pressure considerably before the boss put an end to our antics. We
also tested two players under LANtastic in NetBIOS mode with success, as well
as modem and direct connections. All modes operated perfectly and were mostly
problem-free to setup, although the modem connections were a little rough to
get going initially due to what turned out to be a configuration error.

In multi-player mode the game's goals and dynamics are slightly different.
The goal is still to grab all the flags, but the flags don't go away as they
do in single player mode; rather, you simply try and "run over" them all
while your opponents attempt to do the same. The screen shows where the
various players stand in their flag collection goal (a color bar showing the
flag colors collected). Whoever collects all the flags first wins that level
and receives a bonus; all players then proceed to the next level. Of course,
you can blow away your opponents if you want to distract yourself from the
real goal of flag collecting. Each player's name is displayed above their
tank so you'll know who it is you're blasting your cannons at, and it also
allows colleagues to gang-up on others in the game. The Spectre manual's
advice on having a conference call going via speaker phone is well taken; it
allows you to hear your enemy's expletives when you nail them for the tenth
time in a row.

Although the game's concept is simple, it will absorb countless hours of your
"free" time when someone's available to hook-up with you and take the game
for spin. Irritating but reasonable, the game will not allow a copy to "play
itself," meaning that you can't simply buy one copy, give a copy to a friend,
and have success playing against each other. The game will recognize that
it's playing a copy of itself and refuses to continue, forcing you to buy one
copy for each person who'll be playing. The game is reasonably priced,
however, so this shouldn't be an undue hardship for serious gamers.

Spectre supports Sound Blaster and Ad Lib for enhanced sound effects;
keyboard, mouse or joystick for tank control; and has configurable graphics
levels for slower machines which may bog down with all options enabled.
Spectre is available in a PC version (which we tested) as well as a version
for the Macintosh. You won't miss Spectre on the software shelves: it comes
in the most unusual product package you can imagine, a weird-shaped green box
with a 3-D black polygon in the middle. Spectre, $49.95, Velocity

 GOVERNMENT DATABASES ARE PUBLIC PROPERTY
 ========================================
 by Lance Rose

What do mining sites, pharmaceutical research projects, timberlands, and
computer databases have in common? Answer: they are among the many kinds of
property paid for by the tax dollars of U.S. citizens. Which makes us the
owners of all this stuff, right?

Er, sure . . . though frankly, a few small problems have cropped up with our
national properties. It seems the U.S. government never really figured out
how to manage the massive assets it steadily accumulated over the past couple
of centuries. Control over different public properties splintered quite
readily among dozens of different agencies, each with its own agendas and
ideas about asset management. Soon after each new kind of public property was
created, clever entrepreneurs inevitably found ways to sell our own property
back to us, often in commercial markets and always at a handsome profit.

As outrageous as it may seem, this is business as usual for many companies
that deal regularly with the government. Until recently, precious little has
been done to investigate the problem, much less try to fix it. Now, however,
the public has a new champion, dedicated to cutting off the flow of pork to
private interests and giving us back the benefits of our own public property:
the Taxpayer Assets Project or "TAP", based in Washington, D.C.

TAP was started in the late 1980's by Ralph Nader, the famous consumer
advocate. It first project was discovering and cataloguing all the different
properties owned by the U.S. government. Somehow no one ever did this before
throughout the long history of this country. The U.S. owns an immense amount
of property of all kinds, but the extent of the full portfolio was always a
mystery. From the signing of the Constitution forward, we have been kept in
the dark as to what kinds of property our government owns, how much of it,
and how well or poorly it manages that property.

TAP found that the government indeed holds a vast array of assets, including
mining resources, research and development products, information databases,
buildings and lands, and radio spectrum. As its picture of the government's
property portfolio came into focus, TAP started moving past the pure research
stage. This effort took off when economist Jamie Love assumed the post of
TAP's research director. His first move was to narrow TAP's focus toward
certain classes of government assets. He also began "value- added" research
efforts, resulting in white paper reports to help inform the public debate on
taxpayer asset issues.

TAP's first couple of white papers analyzed the government's grants of mining
rights on public lands to private companies. It then moved on to reviewing
the government's timber management efforts. TAP recently shifted its focus
again, and is currently devoting much of its efforts to two other areas: the
products of government-funded R&D projects, and government information
products.

In the area of government information, TAP is pursuing its goals across two
broad fronts: seeking and responding to lawmaking concerning government
information assets, and the "Crown Jewels" project, in which TAP identifies
and seeks greater public access to the most valuable collections of data
managed by our government.

What exactly are TAP's ultimate goals? According to Jamie Love, there are two
main purposes. First, TAP seeks to raise the public's consciousness about the
full range of its own public property, and how it is handled (or mishandled)
today. The public owns a lot of things that are worth a lot of money.
Unfortunately, our government often does a poor job of realizing the full
value of those assets. Too often, government agencies dominated by industry
loyalists give mining rights, drug patents and other valuable property to
private companies cheap or for free. These companies take those same assets
and sell them back to the very consumers who funded them in the first place
with their tax dollars. Before these vicious, institutionalized cycles can be
effectively countered, the public needs to learn the facts about them, and
develop some suitable concern about how all that money we pay in taxes is
frittered away through government mismanagement and favoritism.

Second, TAP seeks to develop models for how government should handle our
public resources, and for assuring public accountability by the managers and
controllers of publicly-owned property. Public property in this country is
routinely treated by many large companies as if it is "other peoples money"
for use in their private profitmaking schemes. Except in this case, all of
us, all taxpayers, are the "other people!"

In the government database arena, TAP does not want to keep private companies
from distributing government information to the public. To the contrary, it
believes private companies play an essential role in distributing
government-held data to the public. TAP just wants to cut a better deal for
the public than the deals being made today. An important part of TAP's
program of change is to halt the government's current practice of granting
exclusive rights to private companies to distribute designated government
databases. Such exclusivity, and the resulting denial of public access that
results from overpricing and other common discriminatory practices, just cuts
too deeply against our ability to hold the government accountable for its
activities. It also prevents most of us from ever directly benefiting from
the exclusively controlled public data.

TAP is still a small organization, and needs to operate in "David and
Goliath" mode much of the time. It is set up as a "project" within Nader's
Center for the Study of Responsive Law, and has 501(c)(3) tax-exempt status.
Currently TAP has three employees, plus a number of interns and consultants,
both paid and volunteer. According to Love, Ralph Nader himself is strongly
involved in TAP, and considers it one of the most important of his
consumer-oriented initiatives. TAP's funding comes partially from the
Center's general budget, partially from contributions from private
foundations and individuals, and partially from sales of its own
publications. It is very careful to avoid accepting money from sources that
might influence it to compromise its goal of loosening the control of private
interests over public property. Fortunately, TAP is able to leverage its
influence by working with other organizations with similar or overlapping
concerns. These include such groups as the American Library Association,
Computer Professionals for Social Responsibility, Public Citizen, and the
Center for Media Education.

The question commonly comes up whether the Freedom of Information Act can
play an important role in TAP's project of opening government databases to
the public. According to Love, there are major obstacles preventing FOIA from
being of much use in this area. One is that the government does not need to
satisfy FOIA requests where the data is considered proprietary to a private
company. Since much of the data that TAP seeks to open to the public is
currently under exclusive contract to private companies, the government can
often successfully seek shelter from disclosure under that exemption.
Another, more subtle obstacle is a different exemption from FOIA obligations,
for data that is being "published" in some form. Under this exemption,
government information that is privately published for an enormous price
would be exempt from FOIA disclosure, even though for all practical purposes
it is so highly priced that practically no one can afford it in published
form. Finally, FOIA is designed mainly for providing access to specific
publications and records, rather than ongoing general access to large
databases.

TAP is currently concerned with a couple of major pieces of proposed federal
legislation relating to government databases. One is HR 629, the Improvement
of Information Access Act ("IIA Act"), originally introduced in late 1991 and
reintroduced in January, 1993. In its own words, the IIA Act "is based on the
simple, irrefutable premise that Government information belongs to the
people." To this end, the IIA Act would establish certain general procedures
to be followed by all government agencies. Each year, every government agency
would have to issue a comprehensive report on its information dissemination
policies and practices, and accept and consider public comments on how it
might improve its practices. It would also have to announce and justify every
discontinuance of a previously established data service, and consider public
comments before finalizing the discontinuance. All information would have to
be disseminated "in useful modes and through appropriate outlets", which
seems to mean it should be distributed in a form people can use. Finally, no
agency could charge more for the information than the actual cost of
distributing it to consumers, which should be very low in almost all cases if
honestly accounted, and could not charge any fee to recipients if they choose
to redistribute the information further to others. It would be a nice start
if this bill was to become the law.

Another bill being closely watched is known as "GPO Access" as we go to
press. It is a scaled-down version of the WINDO and Gateway bills introduced
last year. Unlike the mostly procedural IIA Act, GPO Access would direct that
certain databases be made available online by the Government Printing Office.
These include the Federal Register (in full text), the Congressional Record,
an electronic directory of Federal public information, and information from
federal agencies specifically requested to be placed into the online access
system by such agencies. Like the IIA Act, GPO Access would limit the
government's fees to users to the incremental cost of access. Access would be
free for the federal depository library system, which has 1,400 members
across the country.

This sounds pretty good, but TAP has some telling criticisms of this
approach, including: GPO Access does not provide for any start-up funding of
the online system; it does not mandate Internet access to the data, meaning
the government could actually set it all up on a two-line BBS if it wanted;
while the earlier WINDO/Gateway bills would have given the GPO broad
authority to designate federal information that would be placed on the
system, the GPO Access proposal only mandates a small number of core
publications for online access, and leaves additional information entirely to
the discretion of individual agencies, which in many cases could be motivated
to keep their information out of the system in order to make a little money
in exclusive deals with large private companies; and various other problems.
TAP addresses such issues not only from an idealistic viewpoint, but with an
understanding of the practical mechanisms that must be set up by legislation
to assure that the promised information access will actually be delivered.

In addition to such broadly drafted legislation, TAP is also working to
secure meaningful public access to the so-called "Crown Jewels" of the
government information system: the SEC's EDGAR system that maintains all
public filings made under the federal securities acts; the Justice
Department's JURIS system, containing among other things all federal case
reports online; the LEGIS systems used by Congress, with full text of all
pending bills and other congressional information; ISIS, a superset of LEGIS
containing additional research and Library of Congress materials; the
Automated Patent System; SCORPIO, a system used by Library of Congress;
abstracts contained in the NTIS system; and the Foreign Broadcast Information
Service maintained by the CIA, with abstracts of foreign news from all over
the world - currently available only in paper.

Opening public access to each of these systems raises major issues. One
glaring example is the EDGAR system, currently the subject of much
controversy. Mead Data Central has an exclusive contract to compile and
maintain EDGAR information, provide EDGAR-based information services to the
government, and to provide EDGAR services to other companies and individuals
as part of its own LEXIS legal database system. The problem arises from
Mead's extreme stinginess in providing basic EDGAR information to others on a
wholesale basis outside of Mead's high-priced LEXIS services. Mead will only
provide same-day tapes of all SEC filings on a given day, unsorted in any
meaningful manner, and including errors and even filings that might be
rejected the next day by the SEC. Only a huge company with an ongoing
large-scale data processing operation, like Mead, can extract the information
on these tapes in a meaningful form and keep a historical database of old
filings. The result is that only Mead, and perhaps a couple of other large
data companies, actually gain access to the government information on a
meaningful wholesale basis. Everyone else who uses EDGAR data contributes to
MEAD's hefty profit on its private data services. Oh yeah - the government
actually pays Mead to do all this . . .

This regime is light years distant from the goal of letting the public have
access to its own data at a reasonable cost, or what those proposed bills
call the "incremental cost of dissemination." Fortunately, some genuine
controversy has been stirred up over this major pork barrel deal which
benefits Mead Data Central and burdens everyone else. One neat move recently
made by TAP was a letter to Representative Markey, who is now very
influential on telecom matters in the House, protesting the EDGAR setup
describe above, and signed by some major computer network companies including
America Online, Performance Systems International (PSI), and Community
Information Exchange (CIX). Although there's a lot of long-built momentum
behind Mead's current monopoly over the supposedly public EDGAR system, TAP's
clear-eyed pursuit of the issues in the public interest creates hope that the
situation may be somewhat righted within the next year or two.

RE: Ten firms involved in networking services ask Congress to provide online access to SEC filings.

RE: SEC's EDGAR system

Dear Representative Markey:

We have watched with interest the development of the SEC's new EDGAR system,
and in particular, the SEC's plans for public access to the EDGAR filings. As
organizations engaged in the providing telecommunications and networking
services, we are unhappy that the SEC is not providing better methods for
citizens to access these filings electronically.

Since economies of scale apply in networking, we are interested in increasing
our customer base to decrease our costs. The availability of more public
information at a low cost will significantly increase the demand for our
services. As you know, the SEC is required by law to provide online access to
the EDGAR filings. However, the SEC's contractor for the dissemination of the
EDGAR information, Mead Data Central, is currently only providing an online
system based upon bulk access to filings, no more than 72 hours old. Not only
is this service priced far too high for individuals, but it requires
expensive telecommunications and computing equipment to receive the data.

We propose that the SEC provide online access to the EDGAR filings to
individuals.

As a starting point, the SEC should make individual filings available to
anyone with access to the internet. To make this service as widely available
as possible using very simple technology, the SEC could develop a low cost
system of dissemination that would provide copies of individual filings by
electronic mail or internet ftp. The SEC could do this by providing users
with a single file which provides the ID numbers for the companies filing the
data, and an index of each firm's filings.

Data users could then send an email message to a server to order individual
filings, or they could ftp the data directly.

By allowing the data to be retrieved using email or ftp, the service would be
available to the millions of Americans who have full or email access to the
Internet, using such services such as America Online, Performance Systems
International, EcoNet, PeaceNet, Fidonet, Pathways, MCI Mail, SprintLink,
UUNET, AppleLink, Compuserve and others.

A system as outlined above could be provided at a low cost in a short amount
of time, and it would vastly lower the costs of receiving SEC filings.

This service would not only benefit citizens who use SEC information, but
also organizations like ours, by increasing the demand for our networking
services.

 STEVE JACKSON GAMES v. US SECRET SERVICE
 ----------------------------------------
 by Peter D. Kennedy

On March 12, 1993, a federal judge in Austin, Texas decided that the US
Secret Service broke the law when it searched Steve Jackson Games Inc., and
seized its bulletin board system and other computer equipment. The decision
in this case has been long-awaited in the computer world, and most observers
have hailed it as a significant victory for computer user's freedom and
privacy.

I had the fortune to be one of the lawyers representing Steve Jackson and his
co-plaintiffs. During the course of the lawsuit, I met many people
passionately interested in the issues the case raised. I watched and listened
to the discussions and arguments about the case. I've been impressed by the
intelligence of the on- line world, and the interest that computer
enthusiasts show -- especially computer communication enthusiasts -- in the
law. I've also been impressed and distressed at how the Net can spontaneously
generates misinformation. Steve Jackson has spent untold hours correcting
errors about him, his company, and the case on both the Net and more
traditional news media.

The decision in the Steve Jackson Games case is clearly a significant victory
for computer users, especially BBS operators and subscribers. I hope to give
a simple and clear explanation for the intelligent non-lawyer of the legal
issues raised by the case, and the significance and limitations of the
court's decision.

The facts.

By now, most people interested in the case are familiar with the basic facts:
On March 1, 1990, the Secret Service, in an early-morning raid, searched the
offices of Steve Jackson Games. The agents kept the employees out of the
offices until the afternoon, and took the company's BBS -- called
"Illuminati" -- along with an employee's work computer, other computer
equipment, and hundreds and hundreds of floppy disks. They took all the
recent versions of a soon-to-be-published game book, "GURPS Cyberpunk,"
including big parts of the draft which were publicly available on Illuminati.

On March 2, Steve Jackson tried to get copies of the seized files back from
the Secret Service. He was treated badly, and given only a handful of files
from one office computer. He was not allowed to touch the Illuminati
computer, or copy any of its files.

Steve Jackson Games took a nosedive, and barely avoided going out of
business. According to Jackson, eight employees lost their jobs on account of
the Secret Service raid, and the company lost many thousands of dollars in
sales. It is again a busy enterprise, no thanks to the Secret Service
(although they tried to take credit, pointing to the supposedly wonderful
publicity their raid produced).

After months of pestering, including pressure by lawyers and Senator Lloyd
Bentsen (now, as Treasury Secretary, the Secret Service's boss) the Secret
Service returned most of the equipment taken, some of it much the worse for
wear.

By then, Steve Jackson had restarted Illuminati on a different computer. When
the old Illuminati computer was finally given back, Jackson turned it one --
and saw that all the electronic mail which had been on the board on March 1
was gone! Wayne Bell, WWIV developer and guru, was called in. He gave us
invaluable (and free) help evaluating the condition of the files. He
concluded, and testified firmly at trial, that during the week of March 20,
1990, when the Secret Service still had Illuminati, the BBS was run, and
every piece of e-mail was individually accessed and deleted. The Illuminati
files the Secret Service had returned to Steve Jackson left irrefutable
electronic traces of what had been done -- even I could understand how the
condition and dates of the e-mail files showed what had happened, and when.

The lawsuit.

Suing the federal government and its agents is never a simple thing. The
United States can only be sued when it consents. Lawsuits against individual
agents face big legal hurdles erected to protect government officials from
fear of a tidal wave of lawsuits.

Amazing as it may sound, you cannot sue the United States (or any federal
agency) for money damages for violating your constitutional rights. You can
sue individual federal agents, though. If you do, you have to get past a
defense called "qualified immunity" which basically means you have to show
that the officials violated "clearly established" constitutional law. For
reasons I can't explain briefly, "qualified immunity" often creates a vicious
circle in civil rights litigation, where the substance of constitutional law
is never established because the court never has determine the Constitution's
scope, only whether the law was "clearly established" at the time of the
violation.

The strongest remedies for federal overstepping are often statutes which
allow direct suit against the United States or federal agencies (although
these are less dramatic than the Constitution). Fortunately, these statutes
were available to Steve Jackson and the three Illuminati users who joined him
in his suit against the Secret Service.

The legal claims.

The Steve Jackson Games case was a lot of things to a lot of people. I saw
the case as having two basic goals: (1) to redress the suppression of the
public expression embodied in Steve Jackson's publications (including his
publication via BBS) and thereby compensate the company for the damage
unnecessarily done by the raid, and (2) to redress the violation of the
privacy of the BBS users, and the less tangible harm they suffered.

The individual government agents involved in the raid were sued for
constitutional violations -- the First and Fourth Amendments. The Secret
Service was sued under two important laws which embody the same principles as
the First and Fourth Amendments -- the Privacy Protection Act of 1980 and
provisions of the Electronic Communications Privacy Act of 1986. There were
other claims, but these were the core.

After the case was pending a year and a half and all discovery completed, the
government moved to have the claims against the individual defendants
dismissed, claiming qualified immunity. This motion (usually brought early in
a case) guaranteed that the trial would be delayed by over a year, because
even if the government lost its motion, the individuals could immediately
appeal. In December, 1992, the tactical decision was made to drop those
claims, rather than suffer the delay, and proceed promptly to trial on the
claims against the Secret Service itself.

The Privacy Protection Act of 1980.

In the late 1970's the Stanford Daily was subjected to a fishing expedition
conducted by police officers in the Stanford Daily's newsroom. The police
were looking for notes and photos of a demonstration the newspaper had
covered for a story, hoping the newspaper's files would identify suspects.
The Supreme Court held in 1979 that the newspaper had no separate First
Amendment right protecting it from searches and seizures of its reporters
notes and photographs if they were "evidence" of a crime the paper had
covered -- even when the newspaper was not under any suspicion itself.
Congress responded in 1980 with the Privacy Protection Act, which, until
Steve Jackson came along, was distinguished mostly by its lack of
interpretation by courts.

The Act's wording is rather obtuse, but basically it enacts a "subpoena only"
rule for publishers -- law enforcement officials are not allowed to search
for evidence of crimes in publishers' offices, or more accurately, they may
not "search for or seize" publishers' "work product" or "documentary
materials", essentially draft of publications, writers' notes, and such. To
get such material, the police must subpoena them, not with the much more
disruptive search warrant. Every BBS sysop should read this act, located at
42 U.S.C.  2000aa in the law books, because I can't fully explain it here.

The Act is quite broad, protecting from searches and seizures the work
product and documentary materials of anyone who has "a purpose to disseminate
to the public a newspaper, book, broadcast, or other similar form of public
communication ..." It also has a big exception -- if the publisher is the
person suspected in the criminal investigation.

The Electronic Communications Privacy Act.

Two provisions of the Electronic Communications Privacy Act (or ECPA) were
paramount in the suit. The plaintiffs claimed the Secret Service violated two
provisions -- one prohibiting unjustified "disclosure and use" of e-mail (18
U.S.C.  2703; the other prohibiting "interception" of e-mail (18 U.S.C.
2511(1)).

The parties' positions were fairly simple, and laid out well before trial. As
for the Privacy Protection Act, Steve Jackson claimed that his company's
publications, both in book form and on Illuminati, were obviously "work
product" protected by the Act, and the government had no right to seize them,
and therefore owed him money for the damage the raid caused his business. The
government replied claiming that (1) Steve Jackson Games' products are not
the type of publications protected by the PPA; and anyway, (2) the Secret
Service didn't know that Steve Jackson Games was a publisher when it raided
its offices; and even then, (3) the Secret Service didn't mean to take the
books, the books just came along when the computers and disks were taken.

As for the e-mail, Steve Jackson and the other BBS users claimed that the
seizure, disclosure, and deletion of the e-mail was both an unlawful
"disclosure and use," and an "interception" of electronic communications in
violation of the ECPA. The Secret Service replied that (1) there was no
"interception" because the e- mail was just sitting there on the hard drive,
not moving; and (2) the Secret Service didn't read the mail, but if it did,
it was acting in good faith, because it had a search warrant authorizing it
so seize Steve Jackson Games' "computers" and to read their contents.

The trial.

When the individual defendants were dropped, the case quickly went to trial.
The plaintiffs opened their case on January 29, 1993. The trial took the
better part of four days; the witnesses included now-familiar names: Timothy
Foley and Barbara Golden of the Secret Service, William Cook, formerly of the
U.S. Attorney's office in Chicago, Henry Kluepfel of Bellcore, Steve Jackson
and the BBS users Elizabeth McCoy, Walter Milliken and Steffan O'Sullivan,
and WWIV master Wayne Bell.

At trial, Judge Sparks was introduced to the labyrinthine E911 investigation.
We also set up and ran Illuminati as it looked on March 1, 1990, and Steve
Jackson walked Judge Sparks through his BBS, lingering on discussion areas
such as "GURPS Old West" to give the Judge a taste of the scope and breadth
of BBS publication and communication which the Secret Service had shut down.
The judge appeared upset by the callous and suspicious manner in which the
Secret Service had treated Steve Jackson, and with the Service's apparent
disregard for the effects the raid might have on the company.

The decision.

Judge Sparks decided the case in February, 1993, in a long written opinion.
The full text of the opinion is available on the Internet at ftp.eff.org, and
on Illuminati itself (512-447-7866). I recommend all sysops and BBS users to
read it, as it is one of the very few legal rulings specifically addressing
bulletin boards and electronic mail.

First, the bad news: Judge Sparks accepted the government's argument that the
seizure of the BBS was not an "interception" of the e-mail, even mail that
had not yet been read. Essentially, he decided that the definition of
"interception" implicitly means "contemporaneous with the transmission"; that
is, for there to be an interception, the government must position itself in
the data stream, like a conventional wiretap. Since the e-mail was
temporarily stored on the BBS hard drive, he held there was no
contemporaneous interception.

Ruling that there was no interception means two things. First, the plaintiffs
did not receive the $10,000 minimum damages a violation of the "interception"
law provides, even though the judge found the Secret Service had not acted in
good faith. More importantly, it lowers the standard for seizing BBS e-mail
-- and threatens to lower the standard for the seizure of all electronic
communications which reside long enough in computer memory to be seized
(which is most all computer communications, as far as I understand it). To
"intercept" wire communications you need a court order, not just a routine
search warrant. This ruling (which technically only applies in the Western
District of Texas) means law enforcement is not limited in its seizure of
BBSs by the higher standards required of wiretapping.

Now, the good news: the plaintiffs won the "disclosure and use" argument
under the ECPA, getting back most of what was lost in the "interception"
decision. First, Judge Sparks found the obvious: that while the Secret
Service had Illuminati they or their agents read and deleted all the e-mail
on Illuminati, including the plaintiffs' mail -- persons the Secret Service
admittedly having no reason at all to suspect of any illegal activity.

Next, he rejected the Secret Service's argument that its agents were acting
in "good faith." While he didn't list all the reasons, quite a few are
supported by the evidence: the Secret Service's investigation was "sloppy",
he said, and there was no attempt to find out what Steve Jackson Games did as
a business; the Secret Service was told the day of the raid that the company
was a "publisher," and refused to make copies or return the files for months
after they were done reviewing them; and the Secret Service apparently
allowed the private mail of dozens of entirely innocent and unsuspecting
people to be read and trashed.

The  judge ruled that Steve  Jackson, his company, and the three Illuminati
users who joined Jackson in the suit were each entitled to an $1,000 award
from the government, as provided by the ECPA.

The Privacy Protection Act was pretty much a clean sweep. While the judge and
Steve Jackson still differ over how much money the raid cost the company, the
court's ruling was squarely in Jackson's favor on the law. Although
unconventional, the court found that Steve Jackson Games' publications were
clearly covered by the Act, should not have been seized, and should have been
promptly returned. At trial, the Secret Service agents had freely admitted
they knew nothing about the Act. Former U.S. Attorney William Cook claimed he
knew about it before the raid, but decided (without any investigation) that
Steve Jackson Games wasn't covered. The Privacy Protection Act (unlike the
ECPA) allows no "good faith" excuses, anyway, and since the Secret Service
was repeatedly told on March 1 and afterwards that the company was a
publishing business there was no defense for the seizure of "GURPS Cyberpunk"
or the other book drafts. Most of the over $50,000 awarded in damages was due
to the violation of the Privacy Protection Act.

Steve Jackson Games publishes traditional books and magazines, with printed
paper pages. Is the BBS operator who publishes only on-line articles
protected, too? It's a question Judge Sparks did not need to address
directly, but his opinion can and should be read to include the on-line
publisher. The court's opinion includes the BBS files as material improperly
seized, and the Act specifically includes work product in electronic form.
Publishing via BBSs has become just like publishing a "newspaper, book, or
other form of publication..." -- the only source of news many people get.

If the Privacy Protection Act is broadly understood to encompass electronic
publishing (as it should) it should provide meaningful protection to innocent
sysops whose boards may be used by some for illegal purposes. It should
prevent the "preventative detention" of BBSs -- where boards are seized in
investigations and held indefinitely -- which seems to be one crude means
used to attack suspected criminal activity without bothering to actually
prosecute a case. It should also force law enforcement to consider who the
actual suspect is -- for instance, in the recent spate of seizures of BBSs
for suspected copyright violations. The Privacy Protection Act should prevent
law enforcement from seizing a sysop's board who is not suspected in engaging
or condoning illegal activity.

Those of you who have followed this case will note how little significance
I've given the "Phrack" investigation and the overvaluation of the E911
document. Of course the Secret Service misunderstood or exaggerated the
importance of the purloined E911 document, and were chasing imaginary
goblins.

The real significance of the Steve Jackson Games case, however, was not
knocking holes in that one investigation (the Neidorf trial effectively did
that), but taking a solid step to set firm, discernable limits for criminal
investigations involving computer communication. To focus on the specific
foibles of the E911 investigation is to miss the importance of what the
Secret Service really did wrong. Out of ignorance or callousness, they
ignored the legal rights of people not even suspected of crimes; people who
simply shared common electronic space. There are and will continue to be
legitimate computer-crime investigations. The closeness that people live in
Cyberspace, though, means the government must learn ways to conduct
investigations without violating the rights of all the innocent members of
the on-line community. In March 1990, the Privacy Protection Act said that
Steve Jackson could write and publish his books without having them seized;
the Secret Service didn't know that. In 1990, the Illuminati users had the
right not to have their e-mail seized and read without at least being
suspected of a crime; the Secret Service apparently didn't know that, either.
Now they do, and hopefully the word will spread to other government agencies,
too.

(As of this writing, there is still no decision whether the Secret Service
(or Steve Jackson, for that matter) will appeal Judge Spark's decision.)

 UPDATE ON GENIE
 ---------------
 by Donn King

Each of the commercial services has a unique appeal to its members. One of
GEnie's major drawing cards is its Multi-Player Games area. GEnie recently
introduced a new game, and several of the existing ones are undergoing
upgrades.

CyberStrike strides on stage

CyberStrike takes full advantage of the IBM compatible with at least a 20MHz,
386SX or better and VGA. It is described as "a sophisticated futuristic shoot
'em up" featuring 3-D VGA  graphics, polygon animation and explosive digital
sound effects. By means of a downloadable front-end program, players control
a walking CyberPod in a virtual reality environment.

If you strapped yourself into one, you would join one of four team battling
for territory in one of several CyberCities. You would travel down streets,
through tunnels and over bridges. You would climb buildings and leap to
another if you wished. You would seek out and destroy enemy pods (real
people, other GEnie users signed in elsewhere).

Your pod could  install up to nine expansion modules from a selection of over
forty, modules which could provide anything from increased firepower to the
ability to actually modify the specifications of the CyberCity.

Simutronics designed the front-end program to ease learning for first-time
users, with intuitive controls accessed by mouse. The game also includes a
Training CyberCity for rookies to taste first blood.

GEnie members move around the system by entering either keywords, or the
letter M (for move) followed by the "page" number. Those wanting to try
CyberStrike can either enter CYBERSTRIKE or M1380. As with most of the
Multi-Player Games, game play costs only regular connect-time rates,
currently $6 per hour at 2400 baud or less between 6 p.m. and 8 a.m. (GEnie
also charges a flat $4.95 per month for basic access. Much of the system,
including e-mail and most RoundTables, can be accessed for no charge other
than the monthly fee). At press time, CyberStrike was still in open beta
testing.

The menu on page 1380 looks like this:

Options marked with a [*] currently are available as GEnie Basic services
(noconnect-time charges).

Air Warrior gets a face lift

Air Warrior, a long-time Multi-Player Game from Kesmai, is beta testing a new
IBM PC front-end portending new levels of realism and better responses to
controls.

Players in Air Warrior fly World War II vintage fighters in live dogfights
against members of any of three nationalities. In addition, ground vehicles
such as tanks and jeeps can be commanded. Heavy bomber aircraft can be
commanded and staffed by up to seven live crew members. Paratroop aircraft
and dive bombers are also simulated.

Air Warrior also has a World War I theater and aircraft as well as Korean War
vintage Jet aircraft and the ME-262 jet.

Because it is still in beta test, it's not yet clear what the hardware
requirements will be; programmers are still writing documentation. I couldn't
get the software up and running, but my machine is a 386SX of only 16 MHz
with only 1 meg of memory (remember when that was state of the art?). The old
front-end program still gives impressive interaction, although by the time
you read this you will need the updated software.

To get the front-end program of your choice (available for Macintoshes, IBM
PCs and compatibles, and Amigas), enter M871, or enter keyword AIR and choose
option 1 from the menu.

GEnie casts Internet wider

GEnie has offered access commercially to Internet e-mail for several months
now, although informal discussion in bulletin boards seems to indicate that
many users considered the service overpriced (they still describe the gateway
as "in beta"). For United States subscribers there is a one-time charge of
$2.00 to register onto the gateway. Then each letter sent or received costs
30 cents for each 5,000 characters, about the equivalent of one single-spaced
8.5 by 11 inch page of paper.

Although the service has not expanded to include full Internet access, GEnie
recently opened the Internet RoundTable to provide support for the gateway
and avenues for requesting FTP transfers and other services.

The bulletin board area explains to members how to use the Internet gateway
on GEnie, but it also includes several topic areas to teach new Internetters
the ropes, regardless of their means of access. For instance, although GEnie
members do not have direct FTP service through GEnie, they can learn the
rudiments of using FTP--handy for members gaining access directly to the
Internet through their jobs.

Other topics cover USENET news groups, FINGER, GOPHER, WHOIS and other
Internet utilities. Members of the RoundTable may request that a file be
found via FTP or the text of a USENET feed be captured. The resulting file
will be uploaded to the Internet RT software library, which can then be
downloaded by any interested member at regular GEnie connect-time rates.

Members can get to the new RoundTable by entering either INTERNET-RT or
M1405.

Bits and pieces

GEnie gained a late entry in the scramble to provide electronic access to the
White House. Enter either WHITEHOUSE or M1600 to find a bulletin board for
discussing the Clinton Administration, a software library containing official
White House press releases and a menu option for sending a letter to 1600
Pennsylvania Ave.

Dragon's Gate is a fantasy, multi-player, text-based adventure game with over
20 races and 8 classes to choose from. "Elders" are available nightly from 7
p.m. to 1 a.m. EDT to answer questions or help with problems. Organizers have
set aside Tuesday nights especially to welcome newcomers. Enter M915;3 to
explore.

If you're not a GEnie subscriber already, follow these instructions to sign
up. (These instructions apply to U.S. and Canada only; e-mail me (address
below) for details for international access.)

1.Set your communications software for half duplex (local echo), at 300, 1200
or 2400 baud. GEnie literature says you can set for No Parity, 8 Data Bits, 1
Stop Bit, but I have had more luck setting up all sessions with GEnie at Even
Parity, 7 Data Bits, 1 Stop Bit.

2.Dial toll free: 1-800-638-8369 (in Canada, call 1-800-387-8330).
Immediately upon connection, type HHH (no need to hit the <RETURN> key.

3.When you see the U#= prompt, enter SIGNUP then press <RETURN>. Note: the
system at this point is very slow; be patient, it will load the signup
software and get to you.

4.Have a major credit card ready. In the U.S., you may also use your checking
account number. However, GEnie recently began a surcharge on automatic drafts
of checking accounts; a credit card is the best way to go.

Write to DKING%PSTCC.DNET @NET.VANDERBILT.EDU with questions about GEnie as
well as comments and observations.


 THE SIERRA NETWORK - ONLINE MULTIPLAYER GAMES WITH A VENGEANCE
 --------------------------------------------------------------

Sierra Online was one of the earliest into the computer game business with a
program titled Mystery House for the Apple II. They've produced games for
virtually every PC platform since, and today own 23% of the dollar market for
PC games. Current titles include the SpaceQuest series, the KingQuest series,
and most recently, a series of games featuring ex-LA police chief Darryl
Gates titled PoliceQuest. Their flight simulator games include Ace of the
Pacific and Red Baron - a classic World War I shoot 'em up.

In 1991 they began experimenting with an online service featuring their
games. In October 1992 they actually began marketing it a bit with version
2.0 of their online software. Today, The Sierra Network (TSN), a subsidiary
of Sierra Online, is plowing some new ground in online interactive games
where callers not only can play games online, but play them against each
other. And the graphical interface is probably the most impressive of this
genre.

The system, while purportedly for online gaming aficionados, does offer some
of the functions of any online service, including electronic mail, bulletin
board conference areas, and online chat. In fact, most games allow chat
between participants and in some ways, the actual act of gaming becomes
secondary to the social elements of the games.

One of the most interesting elements of this is a graphical representation of
the caller. You actually make up a character with a kind of software Mr.
Potato Head function to select sex, head shape, nose, eyes, glasses, clothes,
hats, hair styles, jewelry etc., to create your own reasonably unique visage.
At any point in most games and certainly chat, you can click on someone and
see a bit of what they look like and where they are from geographically.
These additional cues subtly and not so subtly alter the online experience.

Not that the characters truly represent the callers. A fifty-year old
Manhattan advertising executive may look for all the world like a
nine-year-old girl from Kansas - and versa vice.

The program requires extensive software on the caller's end, beyond anything
else going. The terminal program requires easily four times the disk real
estate of the Prodigy terminal program for example, and nearly as much as a
bare bones OS/2 installation. Plan on having 8.5 MB free. And the program
itself requires 550KB of RAM, pretty much precluding it's use with anything
else at all. We had to strip CONFIG.SYS and AUTOEXEC.BAT pretty much down to
parade rest to get this thing in operation. A good deal of the work is done
on the terminal end as well, and callers playing Red Baron from a 486 50MHz,
for example, enjoy a distinct advantage over callers using a 16MHz 80386
machine. Your old hardware can literally get you shot down in flames. Minimum
requirements include an 80386 machine, and VGA graphics.

The program comes on four 3.5-inch diskettes, and the installation is
actually pretty straight forward although the drives grind away pretty
impressively to get it up. The highest speed currently supported is 2400 on
the modem connection, and the installation includes a lookup table to get the
nearest local number for your area code.

When you start the system, you'll encounter the TSN title screen followed by
a charming picture of a house with satellite dish bouncing signals off a
satellite to a big office building. The whole thing is reminiscent of
illustrations of Hansel and Gretal. Once online, a theme park view combining
Candyland with Hansel and Gretal covers the screen. You can click on
different areas such as the Post Office, the Mall, Town Hall etc.

By clicking on a mountain in the background, you access Medievaland. This is
somewhat a misnomer because everyone online terms it Yserbius, which is the
adventure game series you access there. This brings up a menu of different
areas. All are actually different implementations of the same Yserbius
adventure game.

Yserbius is adventure gaming like you've never done it before. You create
characters, complete with whatever funny nose you like, and form teams to
enter the adventure game, slaying an assortment of dragons, wolves, et. al
along the way. You can converse with your teamates by simply typing to them,
and all the various swords, bucklers, potions, lotions, and magic spells are
quite graphic. The scene is three dimensional. It is a basic form of virtual
reality WITH the interactivity of multiple cooperative players - and you can
get quite drawn into it. According to TSN, about 90% of their callers spend
most of their time in Yserbius.

But the system has dozens of other games to choose from. Another popular one
is the online version of Leisure Suit Larry. Again, you can make up a
character, as sleazy looking as you prefer, and go mingle with other callers
in the casino or chat areas - a multiplayer version of the popular Leisure
Suite Larry game by Alan Lowe.

Undoubtedly the chat/adventure game innovation is the draw for this service.
But we could hardly stay out of a bit different game. In Sierraland, we found
The Red Baron. This works EXACTLY like the stand alone Red Baron game where
you are actually in a flight simulation using World War I aircraft to try to
shoot down other airplanes. But in this case, the other aircraft are manned
by other callers. The graphics are excellent, though we couldn't tell who was
who most of the time. The other drawback was that dogfights were limited to
maximum sets of four players. We think larger play groups would be in order.

The service has grown impressively enough in the past six months that
American Telephone and Telegraph has made an offer to acquire an equity
interest in it. So far, the major effect has been to strike everyone in the
company deaf, dumb, blind, and amnesiac over how many people are on the
service, how fast it is growing, what it runs on, or what time it is. It
really is incredible to watch a group of people in a business just lose their
water over the smell of money.

And the service could certainly shape up as profitable - assuming the AT&T
cloud doesn't kill it. The basic plan is $12.95 per month for 30 hours of
access. Since this doesn't allow access to SierraLand, LarryLand, or
MedievaLand, this offer is somewhat disengenous and I would be surprised if
they had anyone at all on the service under this plan. You can't even send
e-mail at this price. Sierra Stamps are required for that at $2.00 per month,
and each of the "Lands" you will want to access are $4 per month per land.
That all adds $14 in options to the $12.95 per month - basically $26.95 per
month. But additional non-prime hours are a very reasonable $2 per hour and
even daytime access is just $7.

The service does eat hours, and some of the delays in waiting for messages,
waiting to get into "lands" and generally navigating from screen to screen
are horrendous. Almost every time we were on, some technical glitch promoted
us to a bare command line at sometime during the session. But with all that,
this service really does convey a sense of place better than anything we've
seen online. The caricature characters add visual cues that ought to be
superficial, but in practice actually do change the experience in a subtle
but powerful way. The service basically sets a new high water mark in
interactivity and graphics. And yeah, it's fun. They currently offer new
subscribes the software and three free hours on the system for the price of a
call to their toll free (800)SIERRA-1 number. The Sierra Network, 41486 Old

 PHOTOS FROM THE SKY - NASA SPACE SHUTTLE - PHOTOGRAPHIC DATABASE
 ----------------------------------------------------------------
 by Jack Rickard

One of the treasures produced by our government resides in a vast trove of
photographic materials created by satellite, exploratory spacecraft, and
astronomical sites. Some of these photos just aren't available from private
sources and there are literally millions of them scattered across various
archive sites in the land. Unfortunately, few benefit from them because few
know they are there, and most of those who do haven't a clue how to pick out
the photo of interest from the millions archived.

One of the most fascinating efforts at making at least a tiny sliver of this
pile of silver available is the Space Shuttle Earth Observations Project's
Photographic Database. The system operates from a DEC system at the Lyndon B.
Johnson Space Center in Houston and it is available over the Internet by
telnet. In short, it provides a catalog of photos taken of earth from the
space shuttle and the photos themselves in digital format. The system holds
hundreds of these photographs available for file transfer.

The photos are in a digital format developed by AT&T for their TARGA image
board, and appropriately enough, everyone calls it TARGA format. The files
normally end in a .TGA file extension. They are fairly enormous, as detailed
color photographic images tend to be - typically in the 3.5 MB range. This
brings up the problem of transferring the files.

The only way we found to access the system was by telnet. It doesn't support
ftp logons as a matter of course (more on that in a minute). To access the
system, enter telnet sseop.jsc.nasa.gov. It will ask for a logon name - enter
PHOTOS and at the password, again enter PHOTOS. You will have a chance to
enter your last name and the state you are calling from a little later in the
process.

From the main menu, entries are  available to look up shuttle photographs by
latitude and longitude, geographical location, or shuttle mission. The
catalog itself works admirably well, and appears to contain hundreds of
photos from around the world, the Soviet Union, Middle East, Japan, Asia,
Hawaii, most of the United States, etc.

The IMG selection allows you to simply browse the database and select a file.
A DL function allows you to download. This is where things get a little
complicated.

Telnet is an interactive login function. It does not typically support file
downloads directly. A number of UNIX BBS packages have offered file transfer
protocols that more or less work over a telnet connection if you are using a
terminal program at your end that supports a protocol. But most of them don't
work - with the exception of KERMIT.

The problem with KERMIT is speed. Despite the fact that we were logged into
Colorado Supernet at 14.4kbps, a KERMIT file transfer protocol over telnet
MIGHT produce a transfer rate of 165kbps downwill with a wind and following
seas. A 3.5 MB file transferred at 165cps takes almost exactly THE REST OF
YOUR NATURAL LIFE to get from there to here.

The system offers some other options - all a little quirky. First, you can
have the file e-mailed to you. But you have to be on DECNET or know how to
address it out gateways to the Internet. We couldn't figure it out. Second,
you can FTP the file. Now this gets a little strange. You can't logon to the
service with FTP, you have to use TELNET. And TELNET doesn't have FTP, but
you can login with telnet and the system will FTP it to you??? Actually yes.
It asks you for the IP number of the system you are calling from (system name
appears to work fine). It then asks you for a filename where you want the
file stored on your host system. Finally, it asks if they need to "logon"
when ftping your system. We said yes and that seemed to work. If you say yes,
you will wind up facing the ftp logon BACK into your host system. You DON'T
want to use ANONYMOUS here. We entered our normal logon name and password,
and the NASA system sent a file by ftp to our host service while we watched.
When we closed the whole thing down and were back in our host account, we
found the files in our HOME directory waiting for us. That was why it needed
to logon as our real logon account instead of anonymous FTP. It actually
placed the files in our own home directory. While we have never seen this
sort of ftp process from telnet before, it worked quite well actually. When
we logged off the service, the files were waiting in our home directory. We
could then download them to our own PC using the somewhat more rewarding
ZMODEM protocol via an sz filename command at a more gratifying 1600 cps.

The system sports about 200 photographic files which you can locate by
geographic location, shuttle mission, or even lattitude/longitude. These are
not greyscale satellite data images, but data files containing actual quality
color photographs taken from the shuttle. Our cover this month sports a shot
of the Colorado front range for example. We took an interest in a shot of
Manila Bay in the Philippines showing Mount Pinatubo, the mountain that got a
little upset a year or so ago. A shot of San Francisco Bay shows the bridges,
and even buildings making up the city. Unlike satellite photos, these aren't
all straight down shots. Some show the curvature of the earth, sunrise from
the shuttle, and oblique views of various landmarks, smoke over Kuwait, etc.

All in all it is a treasure trove of quality photographs of earth from the
shuttle. You can also order the photographs by mail from:

 PLUG IN, LOG IN, TUNE IN - INTERNET TALK RADIO
 ----------------------------------------------
 by Kevin M. Savetz

From the depths of cyberspace, a new medium has emerged. "Internet Talk
Radio," is a new information service that is blurring the line between the
online world and traditional media.

Internet Talk Radio (ITR) distributes weekly "radio shows" via the Internet's
anonymous FTP service. Each show - a half hour or an hour long - can be
downloaded to a workstation or home computer and played using audio playback
software. Unlike a myriad of other Internet newsletters and journals,
Internet Talk Radio is the only one that actually speaks.

Each show is composed of several .au format sounds which can be played on a
Sun or NeXT workstation, among other machines. Personal computer users can
also listen in, but (depending on the computer) you may need to convert the
".au" sounds into a format more familiar to your hardware.

All this talk comes at a price, however. A typical hour-long radio show
consumes a whopping 20 megabytes of disk space. Despite its slow sampling
rate of 8KhZ, ITR is a memory hog.

Carl Malamud is the founder of ITR. "The idea for ITR came from my
frustration with the trade press. I knew they weren't providing the
information I wanted and was looking for an alternative." He notes that the
trade press focuses on marketing and reviews, leaving a gap for a
general-interest, technically-oriented publication for Internet users. "I
couldn't start a magazine because it takes money to print and distribute a
magazine," he said. Malamud turned to the Internet as a general-purpose
distribution method.

"I looked at the trends in multimedia support on the Internet, at the number
of users with more and more bandwidth and bigger disk drives, and decided to
give 'radio' a try," he said.

Some net users have criticized the talk radio concept as a grandiose waste of
network bandwidth, given the fact that the same information in text format
could fit into only a few kilobytes. "The reason you get audio information
from a $3,000 (or $30,000) computer," Malamud said, "is because ultimately
this gives you a very new medium. We're not trying to replace radio, just as
the trucks didn't replace the railroads and the telephone didn't replace the
telegraph. There are things we can do that you can't do on a radio, like go
interactive or add WAIS databases to support a program, or use
general-purpose languages like PERL to make an audio-on-demand server..." It
is the versatility of ITR that is its selling point.

ITR's parent company, Internet Multicasting Service, isn't doing this just
for glory. Each program carries sponsors, and a minute of each program is
given to acknowledge the supporting vendors. The blurbs aren't quite
commercials; they resemble public TV's post-show sponsor messages. ("Brought
to you by a grant from Frobnitz Corp., and viewers like you!") Current
sponsors include Sun Microsystems and O'Reilley & Associates book publishers.

DON'T TOUCH THAT DIAL...

For the most part, ITR consists of interviews. Whether they're talking with
the "Geek of the Week (a featured member of the technical community) or
focusing on "the new American reality" in the "Tech Nation" show, it all
boils down to people conversing with each other. Like the name says, Internet
Talk Radio parallels its mainstream counterpart. Except ITR is a lot more
nerdy.

TechNation is a weekly radio show that focuses on "the new American reality"
- that the U.S. has become the "tech" nation. The premise is that this new
reality is causing introspection - "Americans are looking at who they are and
where they are going."

Tech Nation is hosted by Dr. Moira Gunn, a former NASA scientist and robotics
engineer. She focuses on uncovering core issues as well as important
technology announcements. Unlike "Geek of the Week," which is only
distributed via the Internet, Tech Nation is broadcast over the Public Radio
Satellite System, which makes the show available to nearly 600 radio stations
in the United States. The show has been produced in the studios of KQED in
San Francisco since 1987, and became part of ITR's schedule in March of this
year.

Interviews on Tech Nation have included Dr. Linus Pauling, two-time Nobel
Prize Winner; Jane Metcalfe & Louis Rossetto, Editors/Publishers of "Wired"
magazine" and Bill Koch on winning the America's Cup. Occasionally the
program seems narcissistic, like when Gunn interviewed Carl Malamud, the
creator of Internet Talk Radio.

"Geek of the Week" is a weekly interview with prominent members of the
technical community. The show focuses on "sophisticated discussions of issues
facing the Internet, networking, and computing." Malamud calls it "the
intelligent alternative to today's trade press."

In April, Malamud  introduced a cousin to ITR, called Internet Town Hall,
which includes audio recordings of speeches. In the first week they released
speeches by the Dalai Lama, Bob Dole, Hershel Shanks on the Dead Sea Scrolls,
and the hearings by Congressman Markey on encryption and privacy.

Internet Town Hall programs are good to pick and choose from. Unlike ITR,
Town Hall doesn't necessarily focus on computers and technology. One program
consisted of Secretary Bruce Babbit presenting Clinton's environmental
program to the National Press Club. This sort of archival sound information
could prove useful for those of us who don't want to watch C-SPAN all day. If
you find you need information from a speech given last month, Town Hall might
be the forum to find it.

LISTENING IN...

The programs sound good, considering the medium is in its infancy. After a
snazzy musical introduction, Malamud announces (in his best DJ voice,) "This
is Internet Talk Radio, flame of the Internet." Sound quality isn't great.
Most of one program suffered from speakerphone syndrome: it sort of sounded
like the voices were coming from the middle of an empty room. Malamud said
the sound quality is improving "as we learn how to use our equipment and
adapt it to the realities of this rather strange publishing platform."

Sound quality aside, the programs are indeed interesting to listen to. Its
nice to be able to hear the voices behind the technology. One interview
featured Brewster Khale, the father of WAIS, Inc. and the Wide Area
Information Server. Conversation flows neatly from one topic to the next. The
interview breaks for an offbeat selection such as "The Incidental Tourist"
(restaurant reviews, one which featured ways to achieve gastronomic heights
in the basements of Asian Department stores,) a book review, or "Name that
Acronym," delivering an "arcane acronym to reverse engineer."

Sun workstation listeners only need the system's "audiotool" program to
listen in. Listening on a PC requires SoundBlaster or some other audio
source, plus a program that plays ".au" files or converts them to ".wav"
files. Macintosh users need a program to convert ".au" to "audio IFF" format.
Everyone needs enough disk space and memory to hold 5-megabyte chunks of the
program. (Information on finding the free conversion utilities is available
from info @radio.com.)

As compression technology advances, ITR (and its eventual copycats) will be
able to stuff longer programs into less space. This may be essential to the
proliferation of the medium. At about half a minute of sound per megabyte,
ITR doesn't have time to waste.

 WAIS RELEASES NETWORK PUBLISHING PRODUCTS
 -----------------------------------------
 by Bill Gram-Reefer

At a recent news conference, Wide Area Information Services Inc. (WAIS),
after extensive product development, and testing by Internet users for more
than two years, announced its formation as a new company and unveiled its
initial products. WAIS Server for Unix and WAIS Workstation for Unix are the
company+s first commercial-quality network publishing applications that
enable local- and wide-area network (LAN/WAN) publication of structured and
unstructured data, including text, news or satellite feeds, images, and
sound. The cost of the software ranges from $10,000 to $50,000.

Backed by a consortium of Apple Computer, Dow Jones News, Pete Marwick,and
Thinking Machines, WAIS also announced that Sun Microsystems plans to
cooperatively market WAIS' products, as WAIS becomes an independent vendor
for Sun products. The products support use on Sun 4.1x and Sun Solaris 2.1
and NeXT machines. Upcoming support for DEC Alpha, IBM RS 6000, HP Unix, and
other Unix platforms is planned. Software and documentation is available via
ftp; support will be handled primarily by e-mail. Prepayment is required.

Based on international standards such as Z39.50 and TCP/IP, the WAIS system
represents an open network publishing system that lets users find and
retrieve information anywhere on a LAN or WAN, including the ability to
access participating WAIS servers on the Internet. WAIS is currently used by
people in more than 28 countries to search over 400 information sources
around the world. Current customers and developing partners include Perot
Systems, the Library of Congress, the Environmental Protection Agency, U.S.
Geological Survey, Encyclopedia Britannica, Rice University, Lockheed, Johns
Hopkins University, and TRADE.

Similar, in many respects, to Gopher and like products designed for
individual use, the WAIS products add many features to the Z39.50 data-access
protocol. The WAIS Server provide a powerful information delivery system that
is designed for client-server operation on WANs and enterprise-wide LANs. It
helps users understand what information is available on various server
volumes and provides natural language searching ability that includes
relevance feedback and full, weighted and mixed Boolean queries and fielded
searches. It also supports restricted access and logging for billing
purposes. These logging features also provide system administrators with
feedback and usage patterns for reporting and marketing purposes. The system
also supports the indexing of documents in original formats, including MS
Word and QuickTime; in addition to support for mail, netnews, and r-mail. A
user-definable thesaurus can be used for synonym selection. WAIS Workstation
offers all of the same features, except that it is designed for use on
servers containing less than 100 Mbs for use within an enterprise or by
smaller publishers.

In terms of BBS applications, many opportunities exist for independent
software developers to design graphical user interfaces that will help users
across many platforms--as clients--access and take advantage of accessible
WAIS servers, including BBSs. As content publishers build online libraries,
new opportunities will arise where BBS operators may, for instance,
"subscribe" to and resell to their callers, access to any number of optional
content and/or service packages, which could well include: newsfeeds,
databases, abstracts, shopping catalogs, user-customized electronic
newspapers, yellow-pages, or access to local library card-catalogs or the
22-million volume Library of Congress.

Sysops, who might possibly desire to specialize in a particular vertical
market other than adult GIFs, Chat, or "local Macintosh support," for
instance, would be able to offer customers specialized access to medical
digests, trade information, access to government records and regulations,
legal libraries, or regional business data. An enterprising sysop could earn
a real living serving as a clearinghouse for hard-to-find auto parts by
offering various after-market catalogs online. Another could do nicely by
offering a database of QuickTime clips of actors or digitized recordings of
musicians to talent agencies, or store gigabytes of royalty-based copyrighted
images and sounds for use by commercial artists and advertising agencies.

One could offer almost endlessly specialized online, searchable support for
the handicapped, small businesses, relief and non-profit organizations,
native cultures, or educational institutions. By the year 2001, some sysops
might even be able to afford to offer callers digitized versions of the over
10,000 classic books to be made available by the Gutenberg Project; or, for
the engineering-oriented caller with that special crazed look in their eyes,
access to the digitized works of J. Robert (Boomer) Oppenheimer.

 CONNECTING A TBBS SYSTEM TO THE INTERNET
 ----------------------------------------
 by Jack Rickard

It's a little hard to work both sides of the street. Generally, we are in the
magazine business and leave software development to those who do it best. And
writing about our own product is a bit awkward. But we're pretty persuaded
that the worlds of bulletin boards and the worlds of global Internet mail are
on a pretty imminent collision course. Demand  for the actual utility of
Internet connectivity is rising at a precocious rate, and those demanding it
are showing a decided distaste for the command line interface available from
most Internet providers. Ultimately the familiar BBS wants to be the face of
the Internet and for many callers, the details of UNIX don't hold a lot of
interest. They just want the files, the databases, and the mail.

The last is the most immediate concern. Now that the smell of universal
e-mail is in the air, nobody wants to be left on an e-mail island. And so
bulletin boards are scrambling to make the most basic Internet connection -
domain name e-mail connectivity.

This is not a marriage that technically wants to work. The dialup way to
connect to the Internet for mail uses a Unix to Unix Copy Program (UUCP) g
protocol developed a little earlier than XMODEM actually. And few DOS tools
exist to perform this feat. Thomas Dell's WAFFLE BBS contains a
Unix-to-Unix-Copy-In-Copy-Out (UUCICO) program that functionally operates as
the "mailer" between DOS machines and most hosts. Chris Ambler developed
something similar in his Fubar Systems Unix to Unix Copy Program (FSUUCP).
And a commercial product titled UULINK is fairly widely available.

There have been a few small developers working on the project. Sparky Herring
did an early port for PCBoard systems that Canada Remote was selling. Last
year, Ed Hopper released a program titled uuPCB for PCBoard, and Roy Pereira
of Merlin Systems more recently has been working on a fairly full featured
program titled PCB-UUCP.

Tom Tcimpidis, somewhat famous as one of the first BBS operators to have his
BBS seized by law enforcement in a very bizarre situation several years ago
is reportedly developing a system for Wildcat! BBS systems. Locally here in
Denver, Bill Thoen is working on something similar for Wildcat!.

The problem was that we at Boardwatch felt a pretty urgent need to have a
fairly good connection for Internet mail on our system over a year ago. We
run TBBS software on our own system, and neither eSoft nor any of the
traditional third party developers for TBBS showed a lot of enthusiasm for
the project. So we had to write it ourselves - or abandon TBBS.

Actually there WAS a way to do Internet mail - using a Fidonet gateway. But
an odd combination of events soured us on this approach rather quickly. The
local gateway system was a single line BBS that apparently was born with a
busy signal. And second, there was Henry R.

We don't know Henry very well. He's not a sysop. Doesn't subscribe to USA
Today for his BBS, we're not too sure HOW he stumbled onto Boardwatch BBS but
we were a little fascinated because he appears to be a BBS user. Now
understand that we have about 16,000 actives in our user log, but we hadn't
had a lot of experience with a "user". Most of our people are sysops, press
people, modem manufacturers, or whatnot that are more or less players in the
industry in one way or another. We're not sure, but we think Henry has a
modem, and just wants to call our bulletin board. He did ask directly how to
use Internet mail and we provided instructions to using the Fidonet gateway.

Mr. R apparently had a daughter at a University in another state, and he
wanted to correspond with her by Internet mail. The Fidonet gateway service
is technically accessed by sending an Internet message to UUCP at the
net/node of your gateway. So from our system, Mr. R would address a message
TO UUCP and the system would then ask for a net/node. He would enter 104/2
which is the local gateway. It would then ask for a subject. And finally, he
had to learn that to actually address the internet message as the first line
of the text of the message by entering TO: whoever@whatever.domain.com. It
can't be the second line. It has to be the first line. There HAS to be a
space between TO: and the address. The line has to START with the TO:.

The message is scanned out, sent to 104/2, and software at that point reads
the address from the first line of the text, readdresses it to that address,
and sends it to an Internet host.

The daughter replies. The reply comes in. Mr. R can read the reply. And the
natural thing to do on a TBBS system would be to press R for REPLY and then
draft the message. But no, you have to send a message TO UUCP, select a node
number, and then enter the entire Internet address again - without error - on
the first line of the message text. With each reply, you must enter the
entire address all over again.

During some routine maintenance, I happened to catch Mr. R dutifully
performing this oblation for our computer on the monitor one day. "Mr. Funk -
we can FIX that or shut it DOWN - but if that damn computer isn't smart
enough that our  callers don't have to  go through all THAT to send an e-mail
message, I'm likely to impose a sudden voltage reduction on the ass end of
it." Or words to that effect.

After a good bit of calling around, earst while assistant Mr. Funk  reported
that it appeared there was about to be a power shortage, and if I was going
to do the turning purple thing, could he go home for the day to wash his
hair.

So I announced that I was going to actually write a program myself, in
assembly language, which caused no end of mirth all over the office.

We decided to call it the Personal Internet Mail Processor. I had no interest
in handling Usenet News, I just wanted the uncomplaining Mr. R. to be able to
send personal mail without actually hand carrying the message across state
lines himself. I'd been playing with it for three months before the acronym
became evident. And so PIMP was born. As of January, Mr. R could simply press
R to reply to his daughter. We put an ad in our own magazine as a bit of a
joke, knowing there would be at least three other systems on the planet that
would have to have it. Which at our price for a half page ad, was roughly how
we determined the $179 price. We sold 28 the first month.

PIMP is a full TBBS option module, the only one on the market we're aware of
not actually developed and sold by eSoft, Inc. It's written in 100% assembly
language, and stands slightly over 16KB in length. It loads as part of the
BBS. It allows a TBBS system to import and export SMTP mail files received
over a UUCPg link from an Internet host. It does it more or less continually,
as part of the normal BBS operation. You don't have to take anything "down",
wait till later, or any of that. Mail usually goes out to the network within
three minutes.

Initially PIMP used the UUCICO from FSUUCP or WAFFLE to actually dial the
host and exchange mail. We ran the UUCICO from a separate machine we termed a
"nanny" machine connected across a LAN to the TBBS system. Inbound mail was
placed in an inbound directory, and every minute PIMP checked that directory
for mail, tossed the mail into the TBBS message directory in a specified
Internet e-mail board, and deleted the files. It also scanned that message
board for any new messages and created the outbound files UUCICO needed to
send to the host. The nanny machine checked for outbound mail every two
minutes and if there was any, it dialed the host immediately. So mail would
go out in less than three minutes in all cases. The Internet has improved
dramatically in mail delivery and it is not uncommon to see messages
delivered cross country in two or three minutes. We've actually observed
callers in a gruesome form of cross country slow chat using the message
system. We also implemented a semaphore file system to avoid contention
between the two machines over the directory.

A couple of things came up immediately. The Internet has an unbounded
propensity to send messages of all sorts to people who don't exist. We would
get mail addressed to SYSADMIN, and ROOT, and POSTMASTER and all sorts of
people that never existed. So we implemented an ALIAS file that PIMP would
check to reroute mail to POSTMASTER, who doesn't exist, to SYSOP, who does. I
found a month old message from Ward Christensen to
Jack.Rickerd@boardwatch.com and it was strictly an accident that I found it
at all. A conversation with Ward revealed that he just assumed that I didn't
care to reply, was busy, didn't like him anymore, or something since I had
never bothered to reply and he of course thought I had received it. So we
implemented a function to check the userlog and send back a BOUNCE message to
the sender if no match is found. In this way, if someone misaddresses a
message, they will automatically get a reply from the system noting that no
such user is registered at this site. No more e-mail disappearing into vapor
trails.

The design goals were pretty simple. We wanted Internet mail to work as much
like TBBS mail did locally as possible. And of course, we constantly tried to
picture what Mr. R. would think about all this. One of the functions I have
always liked about TBBS is the ability to attach files to a message. You can
send an e-mail message and before saving it, one of the options is FILE. If
you press F, it allows you to upload a file, of any size or type just as you
would to a file directory. When the recipient receives the message, a line at
the bottom of the message says ENCLOSURE: myfile.zip. If you press E for
enclosure, you can download the attached file. They are very private, and
very intuitive to use.

In the Internet, files aren't generally passed as mail because many of the
mail gateways have historically been 7-bit ports designed to pass ASCII or
EBCDIC text. They will make rather a mess of an 8-bit data file. So the
Internet has developed a common convention of passing binary files as ASCII
data. Two common utilities, UUENCODE and UUDECODE allow this. UUENCODE
converts binary data into ASCII text. UUDECODE converts ASCII text back into
binary data. So we added a function to take outbound messages containing
non-text data file attachments, and automatically uuencode the data and
attach it to the bottom of the text message. And if we received any text
messages with UUENCODED text at the bottom, it automatically UUDECODES it and
reconstitutes the data file presenting it as a file attachment. The result is
that between two TBBS systems connected to the Internet, you can send a file
attachment, and it looks the same on arrival at the other system as it does
at the originating system. Only PIMP knows about all the UUENCODING and
UUDECODING. We tested this function with Roy Pereira's PCB-UUCP, and we can
do the same end-to-end file attachments with PCBoard 15.0.

Another thing that is common in the Internet is mailing lists. Mailing lists
are actually just a list of e-mail addresses with an alias.
JOES.LIST@BOARDWATCH.COM might actually be a list of 100 different e-mail
addresses from all over the world. But any message sent to
JOES.LIST@BOARDWATCH.COM will be resent or forwarded to EVERY ONE OF THOSE
E-MAIL ADDRESSES. In this way, it forms something of a worldwide discussion
group. Everyone on the list receives each of the messages, and if they reply,
everyone else on the list sees the reply as well. We added the mailing list
function to PIMP, and promptly started the PIMPLIST@BOARDWATCH.COM for
discussions about the product.

Offline mail readers currently have a TO field limit of 25 characters
generally. Occasionally, Internet addresses can exceed this length. So we did
cave and implement the wretched TO: line address on the first line if you
need it. If you enter TO: and an Internet address on the first line of any
message, that address overrides whatever is in the TBBS TO field. In this
way, offline mail aficionados can still send Internet mail from their
machine, to the TBBS system, and ultimately out to the Internet.

By the time you read this, we should have completed testing of PIMP Option
Module version 2.0. This release will actually do away with the requirement
for an external UUCICO. We have built the UUCPg protocol into PIMP itself,
and if anyone enters an Internet message, PIMP spawns another task that
seizes one of the BBS modem lines, dials OUT to the host, and does a mail
session - without an external UUCICO, LAN, or nanny machine to do it. It also
includes hooks to spawn a TDBS program on receipt of mail or on creation of
mail. In this way, you can write your own TDBS application to do random sort
and delete operations, or whatever, on inbound or outbound mail, and the
application will be run by PIMP at the appropriate times.

Others are actually developing things to work with PIMP (third party
developers to a third party developer?) Ben Cunningham (Ben.Cunningham%
nashex @uunet.uu.net) has written a TDBS application titled Internet Address
Book. This is a database containing public addresses (Clinton's White House
address for example) that anybody can send mail to and private address books
for each caller, where they can enter an individual's name, company and
notes, and Internet address. Each record has a number and you can rather
conveniently draft a message to number 32 and it fills in the address for
you. Jon Larimore (jon@glib.org) was concerned about cost accounting. He
developed a package he calls TRAFFICOP that simply calculates how many bytes
of traffic each caller sends and receives, so at some future point they could
be billed for it.

Development of PIMP continues. Usenet News Groups should be added quite soon,
and we plan to add a function similar to what is on the Internet as an FTP
e-mail file server. Callers will be able to send e-mail to
FILESERVER@BOARDWATCH.COM with the filename in the body of the message. PIMP
will reply with an e-mail message and uuencoded attachment containing the
requested file.

In this way, PIMP should provide the most seamless Internet e-mail
integration possible for TBBS bulletin boards. And while we haven't actually
discussed it with him, we're pretty confident Mr. R. approves.

We will also be hosting a private developers meeting at ONE BBSCON for
everyone developing Internet mail utilities for BBS software of all types - a
private evening meeting to discuss various items to ensure we can pass mail,
file attachments, and so forth from one BBS package to another, and answer
any questions anyone has about how to handle various Internet mail issues.

 SCHOOLS AND RESELLERS EXPAND BBS APPLICATIONS
 ---------------------------------------------
 by Bill Gram-Reefer

While the Provincial Ministries of Education across Canada grapple with how
best to formally integrate computer technologies into their curricula and
educational process, many Canadian school districts, and the computer
resellers that serve them, are forging ahead with innovative solutions. One
example is the increased use of bulletin board systems (BBS) that let
students, faculty, and administrators exchange mail, download files, and join
in electronic conferences to exchange ideas.

"Computers and technology are an integral tool for learning that cuts across
all subjects and grade levels," explains Lance Macsymic, Director of
Education for the Lanigan School District, 70 miles southeast of Saskatoon,
SASK. "A BBS is a great tool for learning and teaching telecommunications."
Using Spider Island Software's TeleFinder+ Group Edition BBS software for the
Macintosh, Lanigan's 1,100 students in six buildings communicate with their
peers across town in special projects, while teachers hold an ongoing
conference to record ideas, share resources, and exchange solutions for
lesson plans.

Other schools in Saskatchewan, including Middle Lake, Regina, Spiritwood and
North Battlefield have also gone online. Saskatchewan's Viscount district,
with its BBS that offers community-wide access and an electronic mail network
throughout the schools in the district, has been designated as a "school of
the future" by the Province. Meanwhile, educators expand their knowledge of
how to use computers by networking online, using the University of Waterloo's
MacJanet networking software, or by logging onto the SASK Education BBS, and
in joining membership organizations such as Saskatchewan's Association of
Computers in Education (SACE), which already holds yearly conferences.

In Ganges, BC, on the Salt Spring Island situated north of Victoria, the
district's 1,600 students and faculty located in nine school buildings use a
TeleFinder BBS for electronic mail and conferences. The conferences include
discussions regarding the district's technology plan, a different message
base tracks professional development events and opportunities for the
educators, while another conference serves as a repository for ideas for the
district's curriculum development. It doesn't take much to get a BBS going,
either, observed Kevin Vine, vice principal of the Salt Spring Elementary
School. The BBS supports two active lines with but a Macintosh Plus with just
2.5 Mb RAM and a 30-Mb hard drive. Connections are made via a GVC 2,400-bps
modem and a 9,600-bps modem from Zoom.

In addition to the TeleFinder BBS, Tom McKeachie, a classroom teacher for the
fifth through seventh grades at the Salt Spring School, has involved his
students in a special project that features worldwide telecommunications,
thanks to British Telecommunications (BT) and the London Times, which supply
the databases and high technology. Throughout the spring semester, Salt
Spring students, the only school in Canada to participate, excitedly followed
the British Steel Challenge Race. By making modem connections to North London
via BT Tymnet dialup telephone lines, the students were able to track the
progress of a real-life yacht race featuring 10 identical 65-foot steel
Bermuda cutters sailing around the world.

Each ship was equipped with satellite communications and global positioning
equipment. Everyday, at 9:00 pm GMT, each yacht reported its position and
uploaded human interest stories for the students, in addition to
environmental observations including data on ocean currents, water
temperature, and vertebrate sightings. Students, who were assigned to follow
the progress of a particular ship during the race, logged onto the database
in London and downloaded the updates as they enthusiastically plotted the
position of their respective boats on full-sized navigation maps.

Another program that Salt Spring students participated in was an interactive
space adventure, Planet X, where students from many different schools from
around the globe played the roles of space explorers helping to colonize a
new and mysterious planet. All of the participating schools were assigned a
different part of Planet X to explore and cultivate, while trading clues and
solutions with other schools as each solved problems peculiar to its assigned
territory.

The Powell River School District (#47), also in British Columbia, has used
TeleFinder and FirstClass, another Mac-based BBS developed by Toronto-based
SoftArc. Bill Stewart, supervisor for educational technology, explained that
the district+s schools use FirstClass so that students can access the BBS
from the 3 to 5 computers in each classroom. They use the BBS for chatting,
writing projects, accessing materials on CD-ROMs, and for logging onto the
library+s database.

Similar, exciting developments can be found in every Province across Canada.
"There's no way to force-feed kids information anymore," related Richard
Ralphs, director of educational sales for Byte Computers, Vancouver, BC's
oldest Apple dealer. Ralphs referred to the conclusions of Year 2,000: A
Framework for Learning, a document prepared by British Columbia's Ministry of
Education, which defines the broad goals of implementing new information
technologies into the Province's schools. "Students need the skills to source
out information and communicate with others on their own. A BBS is a great
way to train students to do that."

While Lanigan's Macsymic, for instance, noted that there were no problems
installing TeleFinder and the modems without dealer support, teachers find
meaningful ways to interact with computer resellers that serve their
districts. In fact, teachers have challenged their resellers to find ways to
add value with new levels of service and support for computer-literate
customers.

"If you can't beat them, join them," are words to live by for Randy Kokesh,
Education Manager for Memory Lane Computers located in Saskatoon, SASK.
Memory Lane is an Authorized Apple Dealer and Education Support Dealer for
all of Saskatchewan. This includes product sales, support, and service for
all pre- and K-12 schools, and higher education in the Provincial colleges,
and for the Saskatchewan Institute of Applied Science and Technology (SIAST).
About 85 percent of the Province's educational market is Macintosh and
Mac-related product sales.

In addition to direct sales and support, Memory Lane offers its customers
access to a BBS operated by the dealership. Although designed as a sales tool
dedicated to building new and repeat business, the BBS also provides a wide
variety of services. While online, teachers and administrators can find new
product announcements, pricing, and notification of special offerings and
closeouts. Teachers and school administrators also take advantage of an
active "flea market" classified section where one school district can find a
buyer for its older equipment to make room for new purchases from Memory
Lane. Students, meanwhile, upload articles that are published in a weekly
supplement distributed by a local, daily newspaper. Memory Lane also uses its
BBS to advertise its sponsored special events, including its one- and
three-day training camps that teach educators how to telecommunicate, or work
with multimedia and other high-end Macintosh applications. Naturally, modem
sales are brisk.

"We used to spend hours on the phone taking support calls," Kokesh recalled.
But now, by accessing a trouble-shooting message base, teachers find quick
answers from their peers, while the dealership's tech guru logs on for 15
minutes to respond to questions. Future plans for Memory Lane's BBS include
obtaining a FidoNet address and setting up outlying districts as "points," so
as to take advantage of online, networked K-12 conferences. He also plans to
upload in-depth software reviews for customers to access and download.

Like Vancouver's Byte Computer, Memory Lane selected TeleFinder for its own
BBS.

"None of the teachers showed much interest in our old BBS with its straight,
text-based, command-line interface," noted Kokesh. "Users, even those
familiar with DOS, felt lost," Kokesh continued. "A graphical user interface
like TeleFinder, however, lends itself to people who have very little
experience with computers and telecommunications. It's so easy, once they've
learned to use the Mac's Finder, they can translate that expertise into
productive work without getting lost like on most other networks." In Salt
Spring, McKeachie's experience of watching the kids learn to download files
from London provided an important lesson. "Downloading on the text-based
system was difficult; the kids would get confused about which layer of the
database they were in and would get lost easily," he explained. "But
TeleFinder's just great, the kids always know how to find their way home, no
problem."

Kokesh summed it up this way, "Ease of use is the key!" By offering an easy
to use graphical-based communications system, computer stores and educators
have been able to make telecommunications easier for clients and students.
That ease of use turns into productive learning.

 MACINTOSH BBS NEWS

 NOVA-LINE: 40-LINE MAC-BASED BBS
 --------------------------------
 by Bill Gram-Reefer

Go big or stay home! A 40-line Mac-based BBS using ResNova's NovaLink
Professional 3.0 has emerged from June beta tests and is available now for
public callers from around the nation via its 22 toll-free 800-access
telephone lines. In addition, the Nova-Line Information Exchange offers 18
local access lines. Based in Okemos (East Lansing), MI, Nova-Line becomes
probably the largest Macintosh-based graphical-user-interfaced information
exchange in the world.

Nova-Line's goals are to offer member-based associations, organizations,
small businesses, and individuals access to information and resources only
available in the past to large corporations that could afford such services.
Initially, Nova-Line will contain information for Michigan's business users,
the business community, and for business people traveling to Michigan.
Additionally, the main service is to provide a cost effective way for
Michigan-based businesses to reach statewide, local, and national audiences.

Formed by a partnership between the law firm of Abood & Doyle, and the
Dynamic Training Corporation, Nova-Line was originally seen as a way for each
service company to better meet the needs of their respective small business
clients, with interactive advice from legal counsel, accountants, marketers,
and human resource professionals. Additional services these companies can
offer their clients include job placement and counseling, organizational
networking, membership polling, online business briefs, state and local job
bid information, investment counseling, travel services, and small business
forums. James Maceri, president of Nova-Line believes the availability of
these services puts small businesses on a level playing field with larger
corporations.

Separate and private forum areas are being designed for businesses,
organizations, professional and other associations that have between two or
more locations and memberships between 50 and 25,000 people. Using Nova-Line,
members can interact privately with the organizations in special forum areas,
as well as take advantage of the main menu and features offered to the
general public.

Within a year, Nova-Line plans to expand its information base to include the
Midwest and other regions. Because NovaLink Professional is extendable to
allow multiple servers in locations across the country, the business plan
calls for Nova-Line to issue licensing agreements to put satellite locations
in various states around the country to link small businesses and
organizations via computer using Nova-Line's own information network,
InfoLink, the new incarnation of ResNova's NovaNet. Once connected to a
"supervisor" node, any licensed site can exchange appropriate private
electronic e-mail and public messages or files that have been sent to an
InfoLink address. These messages and files can travel to destinations around
the world via built-in intelligent routing, the company claims. This
capability, coupled with planned Internet gateways makes Nova-Line a
potentially powerful and affordable connectivity tool.

In Beta since May 3, the system was scheduled to open to the public in June.
Upon registration to Nova-Line via local-access lines, users will be able to
download all of the software needed to begin communicating with the service.
Additionally, a starter kit will be available in many computer stores in
Michigan. These kits will include a user guide, keyword shortcuts,
complimentary online time and the Nova-Line user disks containing the
customized NovaLink user program and settings. All purchases and billings
incurred from use of Nova-Line will be directly invoiced to a user's Visa or
Mastercard.

Costs for individual memberships to Nova-Line include a one-time set-up fee
of $4.95, a monthly charge of $4.95, and a per-minute rate of 5 cents for
local-line access and 16 cents per minute for 800 not so toll-free access.
Before the summer is through, the service plans to offer Nova-Chat for users
that only want to chat. This feature will give users the choice of the
regular service at the rates above, OR, a special chat package for a $15
set-up fee and a $15 per-month charge for unlimited chat time between
off-peak hours, 6 p.m. to 6 a.m.

Group rates for organizations are also available depending upon the size of
the group and the specific services each requires including private areas for
conferences, file transfers, and real-time secured chat. Potential benefits
to organizations include increased marketing communications to members,
clients, and donors; automatic collection of dues, cost-savings by providing
on-line organizational newsletters, the ability to poll members on critical
issues, and by distinguishing the organization, for better or worse, as one
using leading-edge technology.

Ongoing developments include services to handicapped users. Nova-Line is
currently searching for a chain or several independent grocers to set up an
online grocery service. Nova-Line couriers will deliver the groceries to
users for a small fee. The group is also working with high schools to offer
e-mail, parent-teacher conferences, and access for faculty, administration,
and students.

By using NovaLink Professional's GUI, in addition to other graphic technology
including RIPSCRIP, a front-end graphics protocol for DOS users, Nova-Line
promises point-and-click ease of use for all of its users, regardless of
computer platform. Many services will be available on Nova-Line, including:
Membership Registry, Michigan Pick List, a fee-based service that provides
profiles of most businesses in Michigan; organization newsletters,
legislative alerts to keep users and organizations up to date on debates
concerning their interests, automatic polling, USA Today Decisionline,
educational seminars, electronic mail, courier and travel services,
classified ads, Grolier's Encyclopedia, a collection of commonly used
business forms, a job bank, a bid list, on-line access to lawyers,
accountants, marketers and financial consultants in a forum format;
entertainment listings including sporting events, concerts, movies, and
related services including the ability to buy tickets online via
TicketMaster.

In mid April, a spokesperson for Nova-Line indicated that a national
distributor had already signed on with Nova-Line so callers could reach them
through the service. Another California-based organization with 35,000
members reportedly has signed on as well. With an 800 number, callers don't
need to know the hard disk is in Michigan. "The response we're getting from
places in California, even Florida, is phenomenal," noted Maceri. "The key to
this is ease of use," Maceri continued. "We're not going after the normal
online users, but new users. A straight text-based, command-line user
interface would make access just too complicated. ResNova's product gave us
the opportunity to provide a point-and-click, user-friendly interface to all
of our users."

Len Anderson, CEO of ResNova Software, the developers of NovaLink believes
Nova-Line "is the first serious application of NovaLink as we've designed it.
It pushes the Mac to the max, and is clearly the largest publicly accessible
installation of our product. ResNova will be closely involved. The
significance of Nova-Line," he continued, "has to do with it being a local
board branching out to other regions rather than a national board like
CompuServe."

A source familiar with the project claimed that running on one Quadra 950,
the system could expand to 60 lines via third-party multi-port serial-port
NUBUS cards. Sources estimate that it will even be possible to daisy chain at
least 3 Quadras running EtherTalk and still share all of the resources needed
to run the system from one site using multiple Quadras. This is just a guess,
but with content royalty payments, the NovaLink software with all of the
bells and whistles including TCP/IP, a Quadra 950 loaded for bear, 40
high-speed modems, Hurdler cards, Second Wave external NuBus expanders, telco
hookups and long-distance setup fees, you're talking $40,000 upfront, easy.
I'll also bet there is a very interesting proposal concerning electronic
democracy on John Engler's desk; he being the Governor of Michigan. Nova-Line

 TEXT SEARCH & RETRIEVAL FROM APPLE
 ----------------------------------

Tucked away in the very back of Apple's March CeBIT announcements for its new
Quadra-based servers was a shy press release for AppleSearch, Apple's
client/server-based search and retrieval software available this summer. No
big deal, right? Wrong! Did you ever wonder why there was never a version
update for On Location? Read on.

AppleSearch is a new software tool that lets users access information on a
server by providing full text search and retrieval. Users can search for
information on any number of user-definable topics, or let AppleSearch act as
an agent in performing those same searches periodically at designated
intervals. Supporting Boolean query language and fully-customizable proximity
searches of key words, AppleSearch ranks documents in order of relevance to
the search criteria. XTND file format translators extract plain text from
various document types so users can view the text regardless of the
document's native format. Indexes can be generated as well, for documents in
shared folders, or on CDs.

Using a newspaper metaphor, the AppleSearch Client software provides
electronic reporters and customized newspapers as an intuitive way to
retrieve information. The AppleSearch reporter created by the user "finds"
the stories it was sent to look for on the selected server volumes. It then
delivers a list of all of the stories it found ranked by relevance to the
initial search criteria. Then users can choose to view the text of the
document or view the full document in its original format. AppleSearch can
also display the selected "stories" in a "newspaper" created automatically,
and even deliver it to a specific location on a user's hard disk. These
reporters can be saved for future or workgroup use in a networked
environment. If you've seen Apple Librarian Steve Cisler's demo of a program
called Rosebud, you've seen AppleSearch. Citizen Kane, newspapers, reporters,
AppleSearch; get it?

The Server software performs the searches it receives from the reporters.
Based on Personal Library Software's search engine technology, the Server
maintains indexes of all potential query terms within a document and their
relationship to each other, and keeps a a database of reporters on the system
so they can be accessed by other users on a network. It can be scheduled to
automatically update the index of files on any server on a periodic schedule.
The software can index at apx. 10-15 megabytes per hour.

To set up an AppleSearch server you need an 68040-based Apple CPU (Workgroup
Servers, Quadras, or a Centris), System 7, 8 Mb RAM (at least--AppleSearch is
a true memory hog requiring a 4 Mb partition). The Client software requires
any 4-Mb Macintosh computer running System 7. To set up a network with
AppleSearch you need AppleShare 4.0 or the Macintosh file-sharing feature,
AppleTalk software, and an AppleTalk network connection including LocalTalk,
EtherTalk, TokenTalk, or AppleTalk Remote Access.

Cross-platform support is provided by Personal Library Software, which has
announced it is developing AppleSearch-compatible products for major client
and server platforms including UNIX and Windows.

A separate Newspaper Format Developer's Kit is a separate purchase. It
contains utility routines and a developer's guide needed to write software
that can read and write AppleSearch-compatible newspapers. An additional
Client Developer's Kit is also available if any brave Macintosh BBS
developers want to write custom user interfaces to work with the AppleSearch
Server software. The API comes in C Library and AppleEvents versions. The kit
includes several header and object files, developer documentation, a sample
application with source code, and a suite of test tools. This kit also
includes the Newspaper Format Developer's Kit described above.

Per Apple's usual, pricing for AppleSearch will not be released until the
product ships in the summer. But since Apple seems pretty serious about
getting this product into law offices, hospitals, school districts, colleges,
corporations, and small businesses, it should be a reachable figure for most
budgets. "This is not 'expert system technology.' Pricing will follow Apple's
desire to place this product in the mainstream," assured Susan Gladwin,
product marketing manager for Apple's Enterprise Systems Division. There has
even been reasonable speculation that the client software may even be freely
licensable in the same fashion as ResNova, SoftArc, Spider Island, and XBR
offer their respective user software. In fact, such a strategy would benefit
Apple greatly by giving the blades away to create demand for the razors.
Plus, in tandem with the announcement of its Workgroup Server line, Apple's
new attempt to provide real hardware and solutions for the Fortune 500 makes
for serious price-point consideration. In real-time, the true value will come
from the third-party devs and VARs that will gussy up the source code and
customized scripts for specific applications, like a BBS.

The Apple way to do the remote Client twostep with AppleSearch would be
AppleTalk Remote Access. The ResNova way, of course, would be (I can hear Len
screaming at Alex) "write an external" so callers could gateway to a BBS
system's AppleTalk network and operate the Client software remotely. One
possible Spider Island way would be to gerry-rig something like the Take Your
Order utility, where a user fills out the search criteria offline, uploads it
to your BBS, where the information gets tossed into a bin that would create
and execute a reporter run via AppleEvents. Users could call back and
download their newspapers to read with their morning coffee. The FirstClass
way might involve employment of a reporter form online to schedule a search.
A CD publisher, like Grolier or Voyager, might index the documents using the
Server software, press the disk and include the Client software on the disk
for searches.

It really all depends on Apple's pricing for the software and developer kits.
If the price is right you can bet that any serious developer is going to take
a look at AppleSearch to divine workable solutions for a variety of markets.
One obvious BBS application would be the equivalent of offering an executive
news service (like you know who's) where, for a fee, sysops could offer
callers a selection of most asked-for reporters or even fully customized
ongoing searches of USA Today's Decisionline or satellite-fed news feeds from
organizations like Utah-based Mainstream. Other potential content-rich
partners include Dow Jones News Service, McGraw-Hill, and important workgroup
applications like Lotus' Notes.

On the downside, AppleSearch is not Z39.50 compliant which makes it a
parallel (but shipping) development to a more widely accepted but constantly
evolving protocol that is the foundation for similar applications including
wide area information searching (WAIS). Nor will the first versions support
TCP/IP connectivity, or so we're told. And, finally, we wonder why Apple
stopped at just text. Can we expect graphic or sound searchability before the
end of the century? You can order AppleSearch through Apple's catalog.
Wanna-be developers can get licensing information from Apple's EDS Licensing
Department in Cupertino (408) 974-2320, or via AppleLink: ESD.LICENSE.


 MAC BBS OF THE MONTH
 --------------------

We found two boards of interest recently. The first is Heart of the North
(HOTN), operated by John Darrow and Clarence Christian. Located in
Northwestern Michigan, and serving Dickinson County out of Iron Mountain near
the Wisconsin border, HOTN is a BBS that proves there's not much to do in the
winter up yonder, so go putz with your computer if you're not of age. One of
the first NovaLink boards we've seen running version 3.0, you'll want to
download NovaTerm version 3.03 to get the full affect of the sound and
graphics.

This board shows a lot of potential, running two Supra 14.4 modems on a Mac
Classic II with 10-Mb RAM. It offers 185-Mbs of hard drive space and 2 NEC
CD-ROM drives that provide access to GigaRom 3.0 for Mac callers and Night
Owl (version 7) for DOS users. Over 11,000 DOS and 13,000 Mac files are
available for users. There is a $25 annual registration fee to defray costs
of system maintenance and improvements.

HOTN takes full advantage of ResNova's BBS host software with graphical icons
that help the user navigate through the system when using the NovaTerm user
software and the board's special configuration file. Interestingly, this
version of NovaLink Professional also lets the sysop choose to provide an
un-configured look to the system that shows nested folders much like a
FirstClass system. Being the first NovaLink BBS we've looked at, we were
generally pleased with the performance and layout, once we got our
(admittedly) obscure modem to work with the Config file. Although the plain
vanilla modem would connect easily when used in a non-configured mode, it had
problems responding to NovaTerm when using HOTN's configuration file.

Supporting both Mac and DOS users is a tricky business, and HOTN has taken a
fair shot at it with a variety of files and conference areas. The Mac section
offers conferences on the usual suspects, HyperCard, Graphics, Apple Rumors,
propaganda from Apple, etc. DOS discussions also seemed lively. Cool
implementations of sounds are used throughout to announce logon, completion
of file transfer, and other events.

The Hard Disk Cafe is by far the most intruiging area to wander through.
Here, you'll find conference sections on topics such as: Hints on Games,
Cinema, Books, Sports, Music, What's Up, and World Events. The Interactive
area was not fully operational when we called in mid-April, but promises a
voting booth for online polling of members, a floating trivia contest open to
all comers, a game room, dates in history, and a NovaNet (InfoLink) area for
future networking capability with other ResNova systems.

Unfortunately, the Cinema section mainly contained very personal reviews of
current flicks by would be Roger Eberts. I recommend that one way sysops
could begin to jazz up these kinds of areas is to poll or start a thread
where callers could list their top ten best-ever movies, rather than beat
Indecent Proposal to death over and over. The Book section, too, could use
such a discussion starter. And don't expect the New York Times Review of
Books. It's Northwestern Michigan, folks. Actually, what I saw were charming
notes from high-school students complaining about their junior and senior
reading assignments for English class. Typically, the kids think To Kill A
Mockingbird, a Pulitzer prize winning novel, is a bore. And, to see that A
Separate Peace, is still required reading for Michigan's 12th graders was an
eyebrow raiser, too. From the tone, I was surprised there wasn't a thread on
Catcher in the Rye.

Overall, there are lots of GIFs and assorted pabulum for kids of all ages. In
fact, I was interested to see just how popular Kathy Ireland can be where the
sun don't shine for months at a time. But like I said, there's nothing else
to do in the winter than play with your machine. Just wait until summer when
sweaty-palmed, late-night tradewars action kicks in. Heart of the North;
(906)774-3260 bbs.

After having just to much fun with a GUI BBS, I took the challenge of calling
The Mountain Air BBS. Not to be confused with The Mountain Air BBS of
Roanoke, VA, Paul White's board based in Cedar Glen, CA, runs Hermes 2.1
software under 6.5 system software on a Mac SE with 4 Mbs and 100+60 megs of
hard drive space. An HST Dual from USR runs the show. Open 24 hours since
1990, Mountain Air features free and immediate access with no download
ratios. Plans call for a FidoNet node by the time you read this. Mountain Air
also supports both Mac and DOS users via this (can't help but say it) hard to
use command-line interface. O.K. I'm a wimp, I admit it.

You'll find a reasonable selection of files for DOS, MAC, Windows, even
Amiga. Online games include Merchant, Hangman, and Safecracker. The not
interesting voting booth lets callers admit to a variety of tastes and skills
by noting what kind of musical instrument you play, or what you like to put
on your French fries. Who cares? Pretty lame, actually. Why not ask people
better questions like: "What part of Saddam Hussein's body would you cut off
first? That'd get them going, wouldn't it? The Mountain Air BBS (909)
336-6080 bbs.

 THIS MONTH: ST. LOUIS MISSOURI
 ------------------------------

This month in our feature list, we list 322 bulletin boards in St. Louis.
Since 1985 St. Louis has been a pretty good town for bulletin boards. This is
the city that saw the birth of the FidoNet nodelist and was the home of that
list for several years.

While Beth Brooks has been running a bbs for only about 6 months, she has
been keeping tabs on the boards there going on four years now. To the many
BBS callers, she is known as Fire Escape, and maintains Fire Escape's St.
Louis BBS Directory, which you can always find on "Fire Escape's BBS
Directory HQ" at (314)741-9505 using TriBBS software. She's Fire Escape, and
the board is named after HER, not the other way around. The list is available
as BBSmmmyy.ZIP where mmm is the month (i.e. jan) and yy is the year.

"Fire Escape" got her start in the BBS world when her husband brought home a
modem and told her she might need it. And like most people that keep a BBS
list, she does so because she became very disgusted with the lack of accuracy
with the lists she found readily available. Each month, she personally calls
each and every BBS listed to make sure it is up and running and devotes 4-7
hours daily, ten days per month to the task. Fire Escape is a very unusual
lady - a devout Christian homemaker with a mohawk haircut and a penchant for
dialing bulletin boards with a vengeance. As a result, St. Louis has one of
the most accurate and detailed bulletin board lists in the world.

While we found a nice mix of BBS software in St. Louis, we were a little
surprised to find that 133 (41%) of the systems run WWIV. This may explain
the number of requests we are getting to cover WWIV. Number two is Wildcat!
with 19 systems. St. Louis is overwhelmingly a WWIV town. The St. Louis
metropolitan statistical area sports a population of some 2,444,099
indicating a density of one BBS per each 7590.37 humanoids.


 THIS MONTH AGAIN: MAINE BBS DIRECTORY
 -------------------------------------

Maine is a land of few words, and apparently even fewer electronic bulletin
boards.  But Mark Stoffan of Gorham, Maine took us a bit to task for not
covering the state of Maine in our BBS listings.  He also sent us a pretty
good list of bulletin boards to prove it could be done.  Scott Bodeen
operates the Street Corner BBS for the benefit of the residents of Bath Maine
at (207)442-0997 using Spitfire BBS software.  Street Corner is a member of
FidoNet at 1:326/208 and Mr. Bodeen is the keeper of the numbers up in Maine.
Since we've never covered an entire state on a single page before, we
couldn't resist the temptation.

Actually, the entire state has a population of but 1,227,928 with about two
thirds of the population living in rural areas scattered across some 31,000
square miles.  But with 57 BBSs listed, that is still some 21,542 Mainer's
per BBS.  Just not much to say I guess - ayuh. Scott R. Bodeen, PO Box 962,
Bath, ME 04530

    SYSOPS: To have your board included in the Directory or to modify your

 Fire Escape's BBS Directory HQ (741-9505), The PC Journal Information Exchange
 (965-2717/8755/8528/4759), The Gathering BBS (839-2978) OR on any other system
