			    CERT Advisory

			   October 26, 1989

			Sun RCP vulnerability

A problem has been discovered in the SunOS 4.0.x rcp.  If exploited,
this problem can allow users of other trusted machines to execute
root-privilege commands on a Sun via rcp.

This affects only SunOS 4.0.x systems; 3.5 systems are not affected.

A Sun running 4.0.x rcp can be exploited by any other trusted host
listed in /etc/hosts.equiv or /.rhosts.  Note that the other machine
exploiting this hole does not have to be running Unix; this
vulnerability can be exploited by a PC running PC/NFS, for example.

This bug will be fixed by Sun in version 4.1 (Sun Bug number 1017314),
but for now the following workaround is suggested by Sun:

Change the 'nobody' /etc/passwd file entry from

nobody:*:-2:-2::/:

to

nobody:*:32767:32767:Mismatched NFS ID's:/nonexistant:/nosuchshell


If you need further information about this problem, please contact
CERT by electronic mail or phone.
