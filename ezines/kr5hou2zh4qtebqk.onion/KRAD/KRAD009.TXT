        You know they will.  They always are, they always have been.  Recent
events concerning two well-known Kidz, Forsythe and Narcosis, only further
illustrate this fact. 
        Silly wabbit.  Forsythe's a kid.
                Well, I think it's about time Forsythe received a grow-up
                call, don't you?  

        By the looks of things, namely, his recent 'zine, issue 8 of the 
"Colorado Elite Magazine," Forsythe's scared.  He can't handle a little 
competition.  He was so scared, he didn't even want to admit that KRAD is an
elite 'zine, so he kept his cry-for-help ad, claiming to be "The only 303
elite 'zine!"  Tough.
        Competition is a good thing.  Maybe it will up the quality of his 
"little" publication.  What a waste of good copper wire the transmittal of
that low-level peice of trash is.  Put some pride into your work, boy!

        I, as well as several other KRAD members, have had too much of 
Forsythe's stupid behavior, so we decided to take him up on his offer.  You
remember, don't you?  Elite #8.  Forsythe published his phone number as
"303-FIND-IT".  Well, guess what?  We here at the KRAD Home Base in 3o3 did
just that.  We found it.

        Uh, oh, Forsythe.  Looks like you're up shit creek now, doesn't it?
                That's good.  Cause you are.

        0-day.  It's a way of life.  Some of us live it a bit better than
others.  KRAD teaches you how.  Unfortunately, Forsythe didn't listen.

        By:  The Warez Ranger

  It was several days ago now; me, my computer, and my modem.  Sending warez
throughout the known 0-day world, continuing the legacy that started so long
ago.. Suddenly it occured it me.  
        Where did 0-day come from?  What started the amazing 0-day revolution
that has swept the world, changing the software buying patterns of every self-
respecting k0urrier ever?  How did it all occur?
        Warez.  I needed to know.

  I began my search on a dusty old Telegard board that had somehow managed to
stay alive until then.. I requested a chat call with the sysop, and asked him
just where the warez came from...

        "Find the Trader of -1.. He knows all.."  Suddenly, the board froze..
It was if I could hear the electronic scream of the sysop on the other end,
and the board died on me.. Forever lost to the digital frontier...

        Onwards I went, asking everywhere as to the location of this mythical
Trader of -1, yet it seemed as though no one had heard of him..  Was all lost?
        Perhaps not.  

        For on a secret board located high on a Los Angeles hill somewhere, I
found someone who knew someone who had once mentioned the fabled Trader...
        It took a week before I contacted the eerie old woman who called 
herself Trader of 0.. "yeah," she said.. "I was his assistant in the old days,
but I haven't talked to him for a long time..."  
        Continuing, she added, "He sold his computer, modem, and telephone
line when the warez started getting older.. He just couldn't take it anymore,
I guess.  Anyway, all I have is his address.  He's living on a farm in Iowa,
plowing wheat during the day, dreaming of warez all night long..."

        Thanking her for the address, I hung up the phone, and was out the
door in under a second, not bothering to take a bag with me.. I ran all the
way to the airport, coughing up enough blood along the way to make my jeans
look doubly kewl, and was able to mug enough people in the airport parking
lot to afford a ticket to Iowa...

        Next thing I knew, I found myself in Iowa, en route to the mystical
farm... And there, I saw a man with a golden halo about him, cast upon him
from the sun.. A man plowing wheat.. He look beautiful, like god's gift to
warez, and I couldn't help but gasp.. I knew I had to be staring upon the
mystical Trader of -1.. 

        Approaching the man, I yelled out to him.. "Trader!"  The man turned
to me, pointed, and said "He's in there."

        A small, decreped shack was the object to which he referred, and as
I approached it, my excitement grew by the minute.   The Trader! 
        Upon entering, I could smell the stench of five-day old shit, mixed
with rancid vomit.  An old, shriveled man sat there amidst it all, staring 
up at me, and moaned.. "Warez!"

        "Trader..." I said, somewhat diappointed with what I saw.. 

        "Somewhere, I'm still the Trader," he said... "But lately, even my
shit is 5 day.  No longer am I the Trader of -1..."

        "Trader, you have to tell me!  Where did warez come from!  What's the
origin of 0-day??!"

        "Sit down boy, find a dry spot.. Once upon a time, there was a BBS 
called the Trader's corner, where they had a few public domain--" Suddenly,
the Trader leaned over, and spit violently onto the ground... "--games.. We'd
trade 'em, but it was nothing big.. Until, one day, I discovered it.  The
copy command.  I had just purchased a new game, and it had been released that
day, so I copied it onto the BBS.. Someone asked me how old it was, and I
realized that it was only 0-days old.. 0-day.  Ever since then, I was able to
get the -1 day warez no problem, and did so with glee.  Until, on that fateful
night, I saw a 3-day ware on a board, and realized that the scene would never
be the way it once had been.. So I came here, and was forever doomed to a life
without Tetris..."

        "I'm sorry, Trader..." I had nothing else to say...

        "Now get the fuck outta here, you little shit!"  

        I ran from the place, but as I went, the Trader gave me one final 
peice of knowledge...

        "... Old warez never die!.. They just get deleted away..."

        Hi there, I'm the EleKTr0N, number one electronics expert in the 
electronics field!  Kewl, eh?

        Anyway, I have developed a way for you to convert your 28.8k modem
into a 110k modem real quick and easy!  I'm talking 110k real time, here!
Know how much faster that is?  'Bout 4 times as fast!  Think of how much 
better you'll be able to kourrier stuff once everyone does this!  Kewl, eh?

        Okay, well, there's these thingies, they're called resistors, and 
what they do is slow down the 'ole flow of electricity, so what we're gonna
do is just speed it right back on up again, real easy and neeto-like!  Yeah!
        You get it!

        So just pop open that li'l 28.8 external, or rip that internal model
right outta that machine.  Now, ya gots tah take yer scisors, and be real 
careful and all, and cut off all them resistors.  You c'n go to radio shack,
and take a look at what a real resistor looks like if yah want tah see what
you should be lookin for!  

        Once that's done, solder back inta' place some normal wire, and you
gots you a real nice li'l setup!  A real, live, 110k modem!  Neet, eh?  Now
you just gotta call up the warez board, and download everything in sight,
baby!  Cause you're cruisin' at 110k!

        Yeah!
