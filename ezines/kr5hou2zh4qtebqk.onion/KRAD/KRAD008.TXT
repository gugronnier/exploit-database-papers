        Kewl.
                CEM is so elite.  They were EVEN nice enough to do what I
didn't do for them.  They published a copy of my 'zine in theirs.  That's
very nice, guys, and I thank you.  You can only spread the gospel more.  
The KRAD ledgend lives on.  Joker and Forsythe... I bless your small, your
innocent, naive souls.  For you could not possibly understand something so
much bigger than the both of you.  KRAD is an institution.
        Oh, and by the way, my 5-day friends, you seem to have forgotten in
your 6-day file_id.diz that CEM happens not to be the only ELiTE 'zine in
303 any longer.  Yes.  KRAD is on the scene.  The KRAD 'zine.  The best of
the best, elitest of the elite.
        KRAD reigns over the eliteness.  And how.  How could anything else 
compare?  

I just don't understand 
The things you do.  
The things you say.
You don't even peddle
The 0-day.

        How?  This is a mortal sin, you know. 

        And how does KRAD reign?  Oh, let me.  Let me count the ways!

        KRAD is small, easy to download, a quick, fun, informative read!
                If you use KRAD, you can get back to courriering within 
                        SECONDS!  With CEM, the download time is longer 
                        than the read time!
                KRAD is informative.  CEM isn't.  Did CEM teach you how to
                        build an ELiTE PHiLTER?  Did CEM tell you the gnuest
                        PHASHiON Statementz?  Nope.
                KRAD is what KRAD does.  KRAD IS KRAD!
                        What the fuck is CEM?  I guess it's CEM.  That's it.

Yes, my loyal, KRAD readers.  KRAD reigns.  There can be no competition, for
KRAD will forever be 0-day.  Numero Uno, yet numero cero at the same time!
        The NUMBER ONE ZERO DAY 'ZINE!  How could there ever be competition?
                I see not.

                        WhY?
                                Coz.
