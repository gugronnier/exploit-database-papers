$$ Why Warez Are #####
%% REally K00l! @@@@@@

        By:  THe k0d3z Master

        OKay, Guiz.  I know you all love warez, but I don't think that you
know just how kewl they really are, cause I don't think any of you have 
respect.  You see, the thing about warez is, They're *FREE*!  Yup!  I'm not
joking with you here.  You may not have realized it previously, but you're 
actually not paying even a cent for the warez you get.  Now, I know this may
take awhile to understand.  I was courriering for a major group called The
Warez Abode Kiddies for several years before I realized it, but then, one day,
a Senior Courrier called me in to chat.  After paying my deep warez respects
for him, he told me the secret to the whole thing, which I'm now telling you.
You aren't paying!  I went to a software store, and I saw people actually
paying for their software.  They got some like books, or something like that
with it, but who needs those?  Cause I don't know how to read anyway.  
        So you see?  If you don't need to pay, why should you?  And that's
what makes Warez REALLY REALLY k00l!  Cause if you had to pay, they wouldn't
be so cool!  Why?  I dunno, but they just wouldn't, okay?  Trust me on this.
        Anyway, I think that warez are really cool.  And you should too, 
cause you know about warez.  Oh, let me add one more thing.  The newest 
information, the Warez K00lNess Skale!!!!!:

        -10 to -40 day  -       K00l az ICE!
        -1 to -9 day    -       Really Cold!
        0 day           -       Blizzard
        1 to 2 day      -       Arizona Desert
        2 to 4 day      -       Blowtorch
        5 days          -       Who knows, I've never seen any this old!!

  So now you know how cool you are if you have the newest warez!  Anyway, I
  have to go now, before my warez turn into 1 day, so I'll catch you all in
  the next issue of the elite-o k-neet-o 'zine!  C-ya!

        WEll, Panther Modern asked me to rite a screen saver for this issue,
so I got right to work, and created a very neeto one for all of you!  I 
call it the "elitest screen saver you've ever seen by Dah Fantom Koder".
        But you can simply call it "elite.bat" cause then you'll know that 
it's an elite screen saver!  
        But without further ado, the kode!!

        Okay, well, I haven't tested it on all video cards yet, so tell me
if you find any bugs in it, cause there might be some!  I'm not sure.  But
I'm sure you can tell that it's very elite and 0-day, and you should use it
as your screen saver!  Also tell me if there are any bugs in the code, cause
there probably aren't, but could be!!
        Have fun!

$ Why those hackers suck
$$$$$$######  By:  The Dewd

        I hate those hackers and those guys that say they call themselves 
"phreakers" or something like that, cause they suck.  That's why.
        Yeah.  

        Know whY?  cause they really suck.  Cause they do, okay?

        Cause once, they called my house and they said that my mom was on
crack rock.  

        So what if she was?  Huh?  What are you gonna do about it, okay?

                Them guys suck.

                I hate 'em.  They suck.

                        Cause once, they called my BBS, and uploaded 3-day!

        It gave me a really bad name in the scene when someone saw 3-day on
        my b0rd!  
                Those guys suck.  Yeah.
