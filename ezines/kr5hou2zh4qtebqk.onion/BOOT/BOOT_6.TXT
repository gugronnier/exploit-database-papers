IT SEEMS THERE'S A DEMAND FOR A W/P
SWITCH ON THE ANDROMEDA -- SO HERE IT
IS ...
 
 LOCATED ON THE ANDROMEDA RAM CARD IS
 A PIN NUMBER 25 WHICH HAPPENS TO BE 
 THE POWER (+5V) PIN. IF THIS PIN IS
 FOLLOWED ONTO THE PC BOARD, THERE WILL
 BE TWO RESISTORS (SMALL TUBE-LIKE 
THINGS WITH COLOR BANDS AND ONE LEAD
OUT OF EACH END). AT ONE END THE POWER
WILL GO INTO THIS RESISTOR, AT THE OTHE
R ANOTHER TRACE WILL GO OFF TO SOME
OF THE OTHER ELECTRONICS ON THE BOARD.
WE WANT TO USE THE END THAT HAS THE
TRACES GOING TO OTHER CHIPS ON THE 
BOARD. (CALL THIS POINT #1 (USE EITHER
RESISTOR - THERE ARE TWO)). POINT NUMBE
R TWO IS WHERE PIN 18 FROM THE APPLE
CONNECTOR (7 PINS DOWN FROM 25 ON THE
SAME SIDE) ENTERS ONTO THE PC BOARD
AND IMMEDIATELY GOES THROUGH TO THE
OTHER SIDE (AFTER ABT 1/2 "). THIS
IS POINT #2.  IF YOU TRACE WHERE TH
E THING COMES OUT ON THE OTHER SIDE, 
YOU'LL FIND OUT THAT IT POPS BACK ON
THE SIDE IT STARTED FROM ABOUT 1/2" 
LATER... THIS LITTLE LINK IS WHEERE WE
CUT THE TRACE TO INSERT THE SWITCH.
OK, WE CUT THE TRACE BETWEEN THE TWO
POINTS THAT IT GOES THROUGH THE PC
BOARD. LABEL THE OTHER PLACE WHERE THE
TRACE GOES THROUGH POINT#3.  NOW WE
WILL ATTACH AN SPDT SWITCH TO THE BOARD
 SOLDER ONE WIRE TO POINT 3, AND ATTACH
IT TO THE CENTER TERMINAL OF THE SWITCH
THEN SOLDER A WIRE TO POINT 1 AND 
ATTACH IT TO EITHER SIDE OF THE CENTER
SWITCH. LASTLY, TAKE A WIRE AND SOLDER
IT TO POINT 2 AND THEN TO THE UNUSED
PIN ON THE SWITCH. THERE YOU HAVE IT!
WHEN THE SWITCH HANDLE IS ON THE SAME
SIDE AS THE WIRE FROM POINT #1, REG-
ULAR OPERATION WILL TAKE PLACE. IF THE
SWITCH IS THROWN IN THE OTHER DIRECTION
THE CARD WILL BE WRITE PROTECTED.

To the User: A Key To Abbreviations, Notations, etc...
------------------------------------------------------
>>         = More than just an AE or a BBS
b          = Board has been busy for a while and we didn't get through
n          = System has n drives
Rn         = System has n drives and a Ramdisk
nM         = System has an n Meg hard disk
(-Ind Pw-) = Passwords are assigned individually
(-Unk Pw-) = We don't know the password -- let us know if you do
(-No Pw-)  = Lucky you!  No password to memorize!
SS         = Saturday and Sunday (Weekend, you dweeb!)
3/12       = Board runs at both 300 and 1200 baud

Please only call boards during their stated operating hours!

To the Sysop: How We Compile This List
--------------------------------------
Every two months or so, we go through our current list of confirmed and
reputed ae's and CALL EVERY ONE TWICE; once on a weekend, then a second
time a week later.  All calls are made during the board's claimed operating
schedule.  If the number RINGS both times we call, the AE is removed from
the list (we usually allow 5 or 6 rings when we're checking numbers).  If
the number is BUSY it stays on the list.  For this reason, if you are a sysop
and your board is down temporarily we ask that you leave your phone off the
hook during operating hours if you want your board to remain on the list.
If you decide to go down for good, PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE call the phone company
and have the line disconnected, or your number changed.  This makes it easier
for everyone involved, as constantly ringing numbers are an annoyance to all
of us.  Better yet, let us know, and we'll do our best to eliminate unwanted
late-night wake-up calls.

DISCLAIMER:  We can't be responsible for mistakes unless you have called
             them to our attention.  If there is a problem with the entry
             for your AE then call us and let us know.  We'll fix it!
             Remember, we aren't perfect yet!

CAUGHT MY EYE..IN LIGHT OF THE NAZI BBS
THE MOLESTERS BBS AND THE BUST IN N.J..
A NEW FEDERAL LAW THAT WOULD OUTLAW OR
SEVERELY RESTRICT BBS ACTIVITY IS BEING
PUSHED THROUGH CONGRESS, ACCORDING TO 
TWO SOURCES THE METAL DETECTOR AND JOHN
EDENS. ANOMG THE RESTRICTIONS DISCUSSED
ARE: *REGISTRATION OF ALL BBS AS PUBLIC
      UTILITIES.
     *SYSOPS REQUIRED TO KEEP LOGS OF 
      ALL USERS "VERIFIED" NAMES AND
      ADDRESSES.
     *SYSOPS REQUIRED TO KEEP LOGS OF
      ALL MESSAGE POSTINGS AND TIMES OF
      POSITNG
     *CRIMINAL PENALTIES FOR SYSOPS WHO
      ALLOW ILLEGAL MESSAGE POSTINGS
      WHETHER OR NOT THEY HAVE KNOW OF
      THE CONTENT OR HAVE HAD A CHANCE
      TO REMOVE IT.
     *BBS USERS WOULD BE "REQUIRED" TO
      USE THEIR LEGAL NAMES.
I HAVE NO WAY TO BE SURE THIS DATA IS 
CORRECT, BUT I SUSPECT IT IS CLOSE TO

WHEW-

WHAT A YEAR SO FAR-
BOARDS BEING BUSTED THROUGHOUT THE U.S.
NEW COMPUTER CRIME LAWS BEING ABUSED BY
COPS IN MOST STATES (THOUGH MOST OF THESE LAWS CERTAINLY WILL PROVE
UN-CONSTITUTIONAL IF EVER TAKEN TO THE SUPREME COURT).
AND-NEW FEDERAL LAWS IN THE FEDERAL SUB-COMMITTEES WAITIN TO BE VOTED ON!
ALSO,YE SECRET SERVICE HAS TAKEN OVER
FEDERAL COMPUTER INVESTIGATIONS FROM
THE FBI.

SEEMS LIKE EVERY PREDICTION I MADE IN
EARLIER ISSUES HAS COME TRUE!

NOW LET ME TELL YA WHATS HAPPENIN AND
WHY. THE FEDS KNOW EVERYTHING IS GOIN
COMPUTER IN THE NEAR FUTURE,AND NATURALLY LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCYS WANTED THE
WORST LAWS POSSIBLE ON THE BOOKS SO
THEY COULD RUN AMOK WITHOUT ANY CONCERN
OF OUR CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS.
SINCE OUR LEGISLATORS KNOW LITTLE OF
COMPUTER HAPPENINGS,YE SNEAKY FEDS 
DECIDED TO RAID VIRTUALLY EVERY KID
THAT RAN A GOOD BOARD THIS SPRING.
NATURALLY,THEY SPENT MEGA-THOUSANDS
ON THESE RAIDS AND THEN WERE KIND
ENOUGH TO MIS-INFORM THE PRESS AS
TO FABLES LIKE HACKERS MOVIN SATELITES,
ETC.NOW WHEN OUR INK HUNGRY MEDIA GOT
HOLD OF ALL THESE LIES, THEY TRUMP

IT SEEMS THERE'S A DEMAND FOR A W/P
SWITCH ON THE ANDROMEDA -- SO HERE IT
IS ...
 
 LOCATED ON THE ANDROMEDA RAM CARD IS
 A PIN NUMBER 25 WHICH HAPPENS TO BE 
 THE POWER (+5V) PIN. IF THIS PIN IS
 FOLLOWED ONTO THE PC BOARD, THERE WILL
 BE TWO RESISTORS (SMALL TUBE-LIKE 
THINGS WITH COLOR BANDS AND ONE LEAD
OUT OF EACH END). AT ONE END THE POWER
WILL GO INTO THIS RESISTOR, AT THE OTHE
R ANOTHER TRACE WILL GO OFF TO SOME
OF THE OTHER ELECTRONICS ON THE BOARD.
WE WANT TO USE THE END THAT HAS THE
TRACES GOING TO OTHER CHIPS ON THE 
BOARD. (CALL THIS POINT #1 (USE EITHER
RESISTOR - THERE ARE TWO)). POINT NUMBE
R TWO IS WHERE PIN 18 FROM THE APPLE
CONNECTOR (7 PINS DOWN FROM 25 ON THE
SAME SIDE) ENTERS ONTO THE PC BOARD
AND IMMEDIATELY GOES THROUGH TO THE
OTHER SIDE (AFTER ABT 1/2 "). THIS
IS POINT #2.  IF YOU TRACE WHERE TH
E THING COMES OUT ON THE OTHER SIDE, 
YOU'LL FIND OUT THAT IT POPS BACK ON
THE SIDE IT STARTED FROM ABOUT 1/2" 
LATER... THIS LITTLE LINK IS WHEERE WE
CUT THE TRACE TO INSERT THE SWITCH.
OK, WE CUT THE TRACE BETWEEN THE TWO
POINTS THAT IT GOES THROUGH THE PC
BOARD. LABEL THE OTHER PLACE WHERE THE
TRACE GOES THROUGH POINT#3.  NOW WE
WILL ATTACH AN SPDT SWITCH TO THE BOARD
 SOLDER ONE WIRE TO POINT 3, AND ATTACH
IT TO THE CENTER TERMINAL OF THE SWITCH
THEN SOLDER A WIRE TO POINT 1 AND 
ATTACH IT TO EITHER SIDE OF THE CENTER
SWITCH. LASTLY, TAKE A WIRE AND SOLDER
IT TO POINT 2 AND THEN TO THE UNUSED
PIN ON THE SWITCH. THERE YOU HAVE IT!
WHEN THE SWITCH HANDLE IS ON THE SAME
SIDE AS THE WIRE FROM POINT #1, REG-
ULAR OPERATION WILL TAKE PLACE. IF THE
SWITCH IS THROWN IN THE OTHER DIRECTION
THE CARD WILL BE WRITE PROTECTED.

Please only call boards during their stated operating hours!

To the Sysop: How We Compile This List
--------------------------------------
Every two months or so, we go through our current list of confirmed and
reputed ae's and CALL EVERY ONE TWICE; once on a weekend, then a second
time a week later.  All calls are made during the board's claimed operating
schedule.  If the number RINGS both times we call, the AE is removed from
the list (we usually allow 5 or 6 rings when we're checking numbers).  If
the number is BUSY it stays on the list.  For this reason, if you are a sysop
and your board is down temporarily we ask that you leave your phone off the
hook during operating hours if you want your board to remain on the list.
If you decide to go down for good, PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE call the phone company
and have the line disconnected, or your number changed.  This makes it easier
for everyone involved, as constantly ringing numbers are an annoyance to all
of us.  Better yet, let us know, and we'll do our best to eliminate unwanted
late-night wake-up calls.

DISCLAIMER:  We can't be responsible for mistakes unless you have called
             them to our attention.  If there is a problem with the entry
             for your AE then call us and let us know.  We'll fix it!
             Remember, we aren't perfect yet!

AN INTERESTING MESSAGE POSTED ON TEXCON
CAUGHT MY EYE..IN LIGHT OF THE NAZI BBS
THE MOLESTERS BBS AND THE BUST IN N.J..
A NEW FEDERAL LAW THAT WOULD OUTLAW OR
SEVERELY RESTRICT BBS ACTIVITY IS BEING
PUSHED THROUGH CONGRESS, ACCORDING TO 
TWO SOURCES THE METAL DETECTOR AND JOHN
EDENS. ANOMG THE RESTRICTIONS DISCUSSED
ARE: *REGISTRATION OF ALL BBS AS PUBLIC
      UTILITIES.
     *SYSOPS REQUIRED TO KEEP LOGS OF 
      ALL USERS "VERIFIED" NAMES AND
      ADDRESSES.
     *SYSOPS REQUIRED TO KEEP LOGS OF
      ALL MESSAGE POSTINGS AND TIMES OF
      POSITNG
     *CRIMINAL PENALTIES FOR SYSOPS WHO
      ALLOW ILLEGAL MESSAGE POSTINGS
      WHETHER OR NOT THEY HAVE KNOW OF
      THE CONTENT OR HAVE HAD A CHANCE
      TO REMOVE IT.
     *BBS USERS WOULD BE "REQUIRED" TO
      USE THEIR LEGAL NAMES.
I HAVE NO WAY TO BE SURE THIS DATA IS 
CORRECT, BUT I SUSPECT IT IS CLOSE TO 
THE TRUTH. CONTACT YOUR CONGRESSIONAL
REPRESENTATIVE, THEY ALMOST ALL HAVE 
800 #'S, AND FIND OUT AND EXPRESS YOUR
OPINION, TOO, WHILE YOU HAVE THE CHANCE

WHEW-

WHAT A YEAR SO FAR-
BOARDS BEING BUSTED THROUGHOUT THE U.S.
NEW COMPUTER CRIME LAWS BEING ABUSED BY
COPS IN MOST STATES (THOUGH MOST OF THESE LAWS CERTAINLY WILL PROVE
UN-CONSTITUTIONAL IF EVER TAKEN TO THE SUPREME COURT).
AND-NEW FEDERAL LAWS IN THE FEDERAL SUB-COMMITTEES WAITIN TO BE VOTED ON!
ALSO,YE SECRET SERVICE HAS TAKEN OVER
FEDERAL COMPUTER INVESTIGATIONS FROM
THE FBI.

SEEMS LIKE EVERY PREDICTION I MADE IN
EARLIER ISSUES HAS COME TRUE!

NOW LET ME TELL YA WHATS HAPPENIN AND
WHY. THE FEDS KNOW EVERYTHING IS GOIN
COMPUTER IN THE NEAR FUTURE,AND NATURALLY LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCYS WANTED THE
WORST LAWS POSSIBLE ON THE BOOKS SO
THEY COULD RUN AMOK WITHOUT ANY CONCERN
OF OUR CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS.
SINCE OUR LEGISLATORS KNOW LITTLE OF
COMPUTER HAPPENINGS,YE SNEAKY FEDS 
DECIDED TO RAID VIRTUALLY EVERY KID
THAT RAN A GOOD BOARD THIS SPRING.
NATURALLY,THEY SPENT MEGA-THOUSANDS

'T' INDICATES A TRACK NUMBER.  WHEN A
RANGE OF TRACKS ARE TO BE COPIED, YOU
WILL SEE "TX-TXX".  THIS MEANS SET THE
START TRACK TO "X", AND THE END TRACK
TO "XX".  IF ONLY A SINGLE TRACK IS TO
BE COPIED, YOU WILL SEE "TX".  THIS
MEANS USE "X" FOR BOTH START AND END
TRACKS.  NUMBERS TO THE RIGHT ARE
PARAMETER CHANGES THAT SHOULD BE MADE
BEFORE COPYING THE TRACKS SHOWN.
"STEP" MEANS TRACK INCREMENT.

WHEN MAKING A BACKUP, BE SURE TO FOLLOW
THE STEPS IN ORDER.  OFTEN A PARAMETER
WILL NOT BE RE-LISTED IF IT IS SET FOR
A PRIOR RANGE OF TRACKS.

IF A PARAMETER LISTING INCLUDES "SECTOR
EDIT", USE THE COPY II PLUS SECTOR EDIT
OR TO MODIFY THE TRACK AND SECTOR
SHOWN.  BE SURE TO PATCH THE READ/WRITE
ROUTINES IF THE LISTING SHOWS "PATCHED"
AND TO USE THE CORRECT DOS (3.2 OR 3.3)
.

SOME DISKETTES CAN BE DUPLICATED USING
THE DEFAULT PARAMETERS (OR COPY DISK
FROM THE MAIN MENU).  IF THE DISKETTE
YOU WISH TO BACKUP IS NOT LISTED, TRY
THE DEFAULT SETTINGS OR COPY DISK FIRST

  I will start this article by giving
you an overview of what is in DOS and
what it does. First of all there is
the RWTS. This allows you to read or
write a sector at a time. All oper-

$B600 and ending at $BFFF RWTS takes
up about 2.5K. Next is the File
Manager. This goes from $AAC9 to $B5FF
This is a bunch of subroutines which
execute your commands from basic.
Then there are the main DOS routines.
These interpret your commands and tell
the file manager what to do, which in
turn uses the RWTS to do them. These
routines go from $9D00 to $AAC8.
When you have MAXFILES set to 3, DOS
reserves memory from $9600 to $9CFF.
Setting MAXFILES higher will take up
more memory, lower than $9600.
There is another part of DOS, which
resides in the latter part of page 3
or from $3D0 to $3FF. This is called
the Dos Vector Table. I will go into
detail on that later.

 Well now, lets say you put a disk in
the drive and turned your computer on.
Then you loaded a file, edited it and
saved it. Why don't we take a look and
see exactly what is happening.

 When you turn your computer on (if
you have autostart) the code on your
drive controller prom takes over.
This loads in a routine at $800.
This is called Boot 0. Then it jumps
to $801 and executes that code (boot
1). That code loads in sectors 1
through 9 which in turn loads in the
rest of DOS. Then it looks to see if
you have a HELLO program and jumps
to it. The first thing it does when
loading in a program, in this case
the HELLO program, is look at the
catalog track. Then after it finds
the file and the track and sector it
starts on, it reads in the first
sector. The first sector of a program
is called the Track Sector List or
TSL. This is a listing of all tracks
and sectors that have data for that
program. DOS reads this into memory
and then starts loading the program
in. But where does it know where to
load the program in and how does it
know what file type it is?
The file type was back on the catalog,
more (lots more) on that later...
On the first sector of data, not the
TSL, in the first two bytes is the
address to start loading in at. These
bytes as usual are in reverse order.
Well, now you know a little of how
DOS works. Lets go into more detail.

 Here is where I will probably lose
you. If it gets confusing hang on.
 Now we will look at track $11, which
is the catalog track. The VTOC or
Volume Table Of Contents is stored
at track $11, sector $00. This tells
DOS such things as: what sectors are
free, volume #, DOS version, first
link to catalog sector...
Bytes $01 & $02 of the VTOC tells us
 where to find the
first catalog sector. This usually is
track $11, sector $0F. Byte $02 is
the DOS version. Either a "1", "2",
"3", for DOS 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, consec-
utively. Byte $07 is the volume #
usually $FE (254). The next thing of
interest is the Bit Map. Starting at
byte $38 you will see "FFFF0000".
For now, ignore the last two bytes.
The "FFFF" is a binary representation
of what sectors are free on a certain
track. In the two bytes there are
16 bits. Makes sense doesn't it, 16
bits and 16 sectors. If the bit is
set or a "1" then that sector is free.
If it is a "0" then it's used.
Now lets look at the catalog link.
On track $11, sector $0F, byte $01,
are two bytes that tell what track
and sector to find the first catalog
sector. This is almost always track 11
sector $0F. On track $11, sector $0F,
bytes 1 and 2, is a pointer to the
next sector, track $11, sector $0E.
The links continue until sector $01
where you will see zero's in those
bytes. I have been asked many times
how to get more than 105 files onto
a disk. If you edit the second and
third bytes on track $11, sector $01
to "100F", you will be able to use
track $10, sector $0F for a catalog
sector. You can continue on track
10 sector F and make a link to the
next sector and so on. Be sure to
mark it on the bit map or it will
get wiped out when DOS has to write
there. Well, we have covered most
of the VTOC, lets look at how the
catalog sectors are formatted.

 Starting at byte $0B on any catalog
sector, is the entry for a file.
The first two bytes after that, tells
what track and sector the program
starts on. Then is the file type (more
on that later). Next comes the file
name, up to 30 characters. The last
byte before the next entry tells us
how many sectors the file takes.
This usually never goes over 255
sectors, however text files can take
more than 255 sectors. Now we can
look at the file type. We have to look
at this at the binary level. If the
first bit is set, it is a text file.
If the second is set, it's Integer.
Third is applesoft, fourth is binary.
If the eigth or MSB is set, the file
is locked. It's really quite simple.
$00 means a text file. $80 means a
locked text file. If it is a $84,
we have a locked binary file.

 Now for the complicated stuff, how
DOS writes sectors, INITs a disk,
the "6 & 2" split. Lets say you put a
blank disk in the drive, initialized
it, and saved a file onto it. Lets see
what happens. First off, at $A54F is
the INIT routine. If you did A54FG
from monitor, it would INIT your disk
without a hello program. This lets
your disk boot faster because it does
not have to load in that file.
Ok. So you type in "INIT HELLO". DOS
takes over and starts formatting your
disk starting with track 0 and ending
with track $23. Then it writes the
catalog track and VTOC. Last it writes
in DOS. Lets take a close look at a
disk at the track level. First off we
have what is called a GAP. This is made
up of "FF"'s. Then we have the prolouge
marks, ye olde "D5 AA 96". After that
comes the volume, track, sector, check-
sum, epilouge "DE AA EB". Then comes a
smaller GAP with a different prolouge
"D5 AA AD". Then $342 bytes of user
data. Oops! $342 bytes of user data?
I thought there were only $FF or 255
bytes per sector! (more on this later).
Then we have the checksum. And last
we have the epilouge "DE AA EB".
There are certain bytes that DOS
doesn't write as data. These bytes are
used in proulouge and epilouge marks.
DOS looks for these when trying to find
a sector. Now for the "6 & 2" split.
The hardware on the apple doesn't allow
for more than $3F different bytes to
be written. That's why they used the
"5 & 3" split on 3.2 disks. What that
means is that from one byte, five bits
are taken out and form one byte. The
other three bits form one byte also.
The six and two split is the same thing
as the five and three but allows for
more combinations.

 Now for a little on copy protection.
Back in the good 'ol days we could just
demuffin everything. All they had was
a modified DOS or changed address marks
etc. After that they got a little
smarter and some wrote their own DOS
or used a modified RWTS. But nothing
stops us pirates, all you had to do
is read in data through their RWTS and
write it back out standard. Then they
got dirty, using the text page and the
input buffer for data or code. They
even used the stack (page 1) for code.
To get around this, NMI card like
crackshot and cracking chips were made.
these dumped all memory to disk allow-
ing the text page and the input buffer
to be undisturbed. The newest thing
seems to be SPIRAL TRACKING. The first
game I saw this on was Maze Craze.
Cracking it was quite easy though. All
you had to do is cut out one part of
disk access (at $855) that wasn't even
needed. But who knows what we will be
up against in the future.

 I suggest you read "Beneath Apple DOS"
 and look at the DOS manual supplied
with your Apple. This is for beginners
or people who are too lazy to read
a book...

 I would appreciate lots of questions,
I may not have made myself too clear
or you may want to know more about
a certain area. Just leave me e-mail.

   The Freeze

       D O S     T R I C K S        
 
 TRY THIS TO SEE ANY DOS, REMOVE THE
REAR MOST SET OF RAM CHIPS FROM YOUR
APPLE (THE ONES NEAR THE I/O SLOTS).
THEN INIT A DISK, REPLACE THE RAM AND
BOOT UP UNDER THE PROGRAM YOU WISH TO
DEPROTECT. THEN FORCE A REBOOT WITH THE
DISK YOU INITED IN DRIVE 1. THE DOS 
FROM THE PROTECTED DISK WILL (IN MOST
CASES) STILL BE IN THE RAM UP TOP....
 
THIS NEW DOS IS A SLAVE AT 32 K AND
THE OLD (AND PROTECTED DOS) IS STILL
AT 48 K. THIS WILL WORK ON ABOUT 50%
OF THE PROGRAMS.  ENJOY
 

YOU CAN ALSO REMOVE THE TOP 32K AND
GET TWICE AS MUCH.

=======================================
CHECKSUM TRICK

A  VERY  HANDY TECHNIQUE FOR  TAKING  A
LOOK AT THE DATA ON A PROTECTED DISK IS
TO  DISABLE  THE CHECKSUM IN THE  RWTS.
THE  FORMATS  OF MANY  PROTECTED  DISKS
VARY ONLY IN THIS CHECKSUM,  SO TURNING
IT   OFF  SHOULD  ALLOW  ANY   STANDARD
TRACK/SECTOR  UTILITY  TO LOOK  AT  THE
DISK!  TO DO THIS, BOOT UP THE DOS THAT
YOU WISH TO USE, AND ENTER THE MONITOR.
THEN  ENTER   B942:18 FOR  DOS  3.3  OR
B963:18  FOR DOS 3.2.   THIS CHANGES  A
SET  CARRY INSTRUCTION TO A CLEAR CARRY
INSTRUCTION.  NOW RETURN TO DOS AND RUN
YOUR  EDITOR.   IF  THE  DISK  YOU  ARE
LOOKING  AT  IS  PROTECTED  WITH   THIS
SYSTEM,  YOU  SHOULD BE ABLE TO READ IT
NOW. TO MAKE  THIS CHANGE TO A DOS ON A
DISK, THIS DATA IS CONTAINED IN TRACK 0
SECTOR  3,  AT EITHER BYTE $42 OR  BYTE
$63, FOR DOS 3.3 OR 3.2, RESPECTIVELY.
GOOD LUCK.......
                     RANDY

=======================================

TO AVOID RE-LOADING THE LANGUAGE CARD
ON BOOTUP ( A MAJOR IRRITATION )
CHANGE THE FOLLOWING :
 
 
IN A 48K SYSTEM, CHANGE $BFCC TO 00 AND
$BFCF TO 00 : THIS WILL PREVENT THE 
LANGUAGE CARD FROM BEING WRITTEN TO.
(INITIALIZE A DISKETTE WITH THIS DO
 TO MAKE IT BOOT UP IN THIS FASHION)
 
(IF YOU LOOK AT THE CODE, YOU CAN MAKE 
THE SAME MODS IN A COPY OF A SYST
MASTER ON THE DISK ITSELF, SO A MASTER
CREATE WILL PUT THIS DOS ON A DISKETTE.
CHANGE THE CODE THAT SAYS LDA C081 WITH
LDA C000 -- THAT SSHOULD WORK FINE.
 
=======================================

GET INTO MONITOR FROM A NORMAL DISK.
TYPE:   400<A800.ABFFM
 
POOF THERE YOU HAVE ALL THE DOS COMANDS
NOTICE THAT ALL THE LETTERS IN THE
COMAND ARE FLASHING BUT THE LAST ONE
THAT IS TO TELL YOU WHERE THE COMAND
ENDS. NOW NOTICE WHERE THE INIT,LOAD,
BLOAD,SAVE,BSAVE,CATALOG, ETC...
THEN BOOT SOMETHING LIKE BRAIN SURGEON
OR SOMETHING THAT HAS SOMETHING LIKE
A NORMAL FORMAT THEN TYPE THAT LINE
AND THEN YOU CAN SEE IF THEY CHANGED
ANY OF THE COMANDS!

INPUT VALUES. PREFIXES ARE ABBREVIATION
WHICH REPRESENT SPECIFIC DATA CATAGORIE
TO THE SYSTEM WHEN INPUT BY THE USER. 
AN EXAMPLE OF A PREFIX IS "TN"WHICH 
MEANS "TELEPHONE NUMBER". AN INPUT 
FORMAT DETERMINES THE NUMBER OF CHARAC-
TERS FOLLOWING A PREFIX AS WELL AS THE
PATTERN IN WHICH THESE MUST BE ENTERED.
FOR EXAMPLE, "TN XXX-XXXX" MEANS THAT 
THE PREFIX "TN" MUST BE FOLLOWED BY

             STEP BY STEP GUIDE TO BACKING-UP DISKS
                              WITH
                         NIBBLES AWAY ][

     THERE ARE THREE BASIC STEPS TO BACKUP A DISKETTE:

1. LOCATE THE TRACKS WHICH CONTAIN DATA.
2. FIND THE ADDRESS MARKER FOR THE SECTORS THERE.
3. FIGURE OUT ANY ADDITIONAL PROTECTION.

(HINT: #3 IS THE HARD ONE!)

     FOR  MOST  OF  THE PROCEDURES BELOW,  A BASIC WORKING  KNOWLEDGE  OF  THE
TRACK/BIT EDITOR (TBE) IS REQUIRED.   FOR THOSE WHO ARE NOT FAMILIAR WITH  THE
TBE,  AN OVERALL DESCRIPTION AND SOME EXAMPLES ARE GIVEN BELOW.   THE EXAMPLES
ARE  EASIER TO UNDERSTAND IF THEY ARE PERFORMED AS YOU READ THIS,  SO YOU  MAY
WANT TO BOOT UP NIBBLES AWAY ][ AND TRY THEM OUT TO GET A BETTER UNDERSTANDING
OF WHAT IS GOING ON.

     ENTER  THE  TBE  BY SELECTING OPTION 'T' FROM THE  MAIN  MENU.   A  LARGE
SECTION  OF  NUMBERS WILL APPEAR ON THE SCREEN,  WITH TWO DASHED LINES AT  THE
TOP.   THE  INFORMATION IN BETWEEN THESE LINES IS THE STATUS  INFORMATION  AND
INFORMS YOU OF SUCH THINGS AS CURSOR POSITION,  TRACK NUMBER,  AND IS ALSO THE
LOCATION  WHERE VARIOUS PROMPTS APPEAR FOR CERTAIN FUNCTIONS.   THE NUMBERS AT
THE  BOTTOM  ARE SEPARATED INTO TWO SECTIONS.   ON THE LEFT ARE  THE  STARTING
MEMORY  ADDRESS'S FOR EACH LINE TO THE RIGHT.   MOVE THE CURSOR  AROUND  USING
I,J,K OR M, AND WATCH THE ADDR INDICATOR IN THE STATUS LINE.  IT WILL TELL YOU
EXACTLY WHAT MEMORY ADDRESS THE VALUE UNDER THE CURSOR REPRESENTS.   THE ARROW
KEYS  CHANGE THE AREA OF MEMORY WHICH YOU CAN SEE.   THEY SHIFT YOUR VIEW  256
BYTES FORWARD OR BACKWARD AT A TIME.   THE ONLY REALLY IMPORTANT THING TO KNOW
FOR  THIS DISCUSSION IS HOW TO USE THE ARROW KEYS TO MOVE THE VIEWING 'WINDOW'
AROUND IN MEMORY.
     THE  ';'  (UNSHIFTED '+') AND THE '-' KEYS INCREMENT  AND  DECREMENT  THE
TRACK  NUMBER IN THE STATUS LINE.   PRESSING 'R' WILL CAUSE DRIVE ONE TO  READ
THE  DATA FROM THE TRACK INDICATED IN THE STATUS LINE INTO MEMORY.   THE BYTES
ON THE SCREEN WILL CHANGE,  SINCE DIFFERENT DATA HAS BEEN READ  IN.   PRESSING
THE  'R'  KEY  MULTIPLE TIMES WILL RESULT IN DIFFERENT DATA  BEING  DISPLAYED.
THIS IS BECAUSE NIBBLES AWAY ][ STARTS READING AT WHATEVER POINT HAPPENS TO BE
UNDER THE HEAD WHEN THE DRIVE IS TURNED ON,  WHICH IS RANDOM, HENCE THE CHANGE
IN  THE  DISPLAYED DATA (THE DATA IS NOT ACTUALLY DIFFERENT,  IT IS  JUST  NOT
LOADED AT THE SAME MEMORY LOCATION AS IT WAS PREVIOUSLY).

STEP 1:
     TO  DO  THIS WE MUST LOCATE ALL OF THE TRACKS ON THE DISK  WHICH  CONTAIN
DATA.   TO DO THIS WE SHOULD HAVE THE TRACK POINTER SET TO TRACK 00.  PRESSING
'R'  WILL READ IN THE TRACK AND SHOW IT ON THE SCREEN.   THE ARROW KEYS SHOULD
BE  USED  TO MOVE THE VIEWING 'WINDOW' TO START AT $2000.   NOW WE  WILL  MOVE
FORWARD  AND TRY TO DETERMINE IF THIS TRACK CONTAINS  VALID  DATA.   ACTUALLY,
TRACK 00 MUST CONTAIN SOME DATA IN ORDER FOR THE DISK TO BOOT,  BUT WE WILL BE
USING THIS PROCEDURE ON OTHER TRACKS WHICH DO NOT NECESSARILY CONTAIN DATA.
     THE  MAIN  THING  WHICH WILL IDENTIFY A TRACK AS CONTAINING DATA  IS  THE
PRESENCE OF GAPS.   GAPS ARE SECTIONS OF THE SAME BYTE REPEATED SEVERAL TIMES.
NORMALLY THEY ARE MADE UP OF $FF'S AND ARE 6-20 IN LENGTH.   TO SEE WHAT THESE
LOOK  LIKE,  INSERT YOUR SYSTEM MASTER DISK AND READ IN TRACK 00 AS  DESCRIBED
ABOVE.   MOVING  THROUGH  THE BUFFER WITH THE ARROW KEYS WILL REVEAL  A  LARGE
VARIETY  OF VALUES.   SPACED OUT AMONG THESE SHOULD BE SECTIONS OF FF'S  WHICH
CONTAIN ABOUT 6-20 IN A ROW,  DEPENDING ON THE EXACT DISK.   NORMALLY DOS  3.2
DISKS HAVE LARGER GAPS THAN DOS 3.3 DISKS.  THERE SHOULD BE MANY OCCURANCES OF
THE  GAPS,  SPACED OUT SO THAT YOU SEE ONE ABOUT EVERY OTHER TIME THAT YOU USE
THE ARROW KEYS TO MOVE FORWARD OR BACKWARD.

NOTE:YOU  MAY SEE A SECOND,  SMALLER (2-5 $FF'S),  GAP FOLLOWING A LARGE  GAP,
     WITH  A SMALL SECTION OF DATA IN BETWEEN.   THIS IS CALLED THE  SECONDARY
     GAP.   WHEN  REFERING TO A GAP HERE,  WE WILL ALWAYS BE TALKING ABOUT THE
     PRIMARY GAP, NOT THE SECONDARY ONE.

     NOW TRY LOOKING AT OTHER TRACKS ON THE DISK.  FIRST LOOK ONLY AT THE FULL
TRACKS  (NO .5 ON THE END).   ALL OF THEM WILL BE SIMILAR TO TRACK 00  IN  THE
APPEARANCE  OF  THE GAPS.   YOU MAY WANT TO TRY THIS SEVERAL TIMES  TO  BECOME
COMFORTABLE WITH LOCATING GAPS ON A GIVEN TRACK.
     NOW READ IN A HALF TRACK (.5 ON THE END).   SCAN MEMORY TO LACATE SOME OF
THE GAPS.  SINCE SYSTEM MASTER DISKS DO NOT USE HALF-TRACKS, THE DATA WHICH WE
SEE HERE IS REALLY 'CROSS-TALK'.  IN OTHER WORDS, DATA WAS WRITTEN ON THE FULL
TRACK,  BUT  THE  MAGNETIC PATTERN SPREAD OUT A BIT,  AND SO WE SEE SOME  DATA
HERE.   THE TELL-TALE SIGN OF THIS PHENOMENA IS THAT THE GAPS WILL NOT BE  ALL
THE  SAME.   THAT IS,  THEY MAY HAVE ONE OR MORE VALUES IN THEM WHICH ARE  NOT
CONSISTENT.   THIS TELLS US THAT THERE IS SOME DATA ON THIS TRACK, BUT THAT IT
IS NOT VALID DATA.  TAKE A LOOK AT SOME OTHER HALF-TRACKS SO THAT YOU CAN TELL
IF YOU ARE LOOKING AT A FULL TRACK OR A HALF TRACK BY EXAMINING THE GAPS.
     THE NEXT ITEM WHICH YOU NEED TO BE ABLE TO IDENTIFY IS A BLANK TRACK.  TO
DO THIS, INSERT A BLANK (NON-INITIALIZED) DISK INTO DRIVE ONE.  READ ANY TRACK
ON  THIS  DISK AND SCAN THROUGH THE MEMORY ADDRESSES.   THERE WILL BE NO  GAPS
FOUND,  AND  MANY OF THE BYTES SEEN ON A TRACK LIKE THIS WILL END IN  0  (I.E.
$A0,$B0,$E0),  WHICH ARE NOT LEGAL DISK BYTES.  THIS MEANS THAT THE CONTROLLER
CAN FIND NO VALID DATA ON THE TRACK.  SOME DISKS HAVE PORTIONS OF TRACKS WHICH
ARE NOT USED,  SO YOU SHOULD ALWAYS BE SURE TO EXAMINE AT LEAST 24 SCREENFULLS
OF INFORMATION TO MAKE SURE THAT THERE IS NO DATA AT ANY POINT ON THE TRACK.
     OUR  NEXT  TOOL FOR FINDING DATA IS THE FACT THAT VALID DATA MUST  BE  AT
LEAST 1 TRACK APART.   IN OTHER WORDS,  IF YOU LOCATE DATA ON TRACK 3.5,  THEN
TRACK  4  CANNOT HAVE DATA AND THE NEXT PLACE WHERE DATA CAN BE IS TRACK  4.5.
THIS IS VERY HELPFUL FOR FINDING TRACKS WITH DATA.

NOTE: IF  YOU LOCATE DATA ON A GIVEN TRACK,  IT IS A GOOD IDEA TO LOOK AT  THE
     TRACKS  ONE HALF TRACK TO EITHER SIDE,  TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY LOOK  LESS
     VALID THAN THE ONE THAT YOU HAVE SELECTED AS THE REAL ONE.

     WELL,  NOW THAT WE KNOW HOW TO LOACATE DATA ON A TRACK,  WE CAN BEGIN  AT
TRACK 0 AND STEP TOWARDS TRACK 22, CHECKING EACH TRACK TO SEE IF IT APPEARS TO
HAVE DATA ON IT.   MOST DISKS HAVE A PATTERN TO THE POSITION OF THE DATA,  AND
IF  YOU CAN FIGURE IT OUT,  YOU MAY BE ABLE TO JUST CHECK A FEW TRACKS TO MAKE
SURE,  AND THEN GO ON TO STEP 2.  OTHERWISE THE DATA MUST BE LOCATED ONE TRACK
AT A TIME.
     MOST  DISKS USE THE STANDARD TRACKS (1,2,3,...,22),  BUT THERE  ARE  SOME
WHICH  USE HALF-TRACKS AND SOME WHICH USE ALL THE WAY OUT TO TRACK 23  (WHICH,
BY  THE WAY CANNOT BE READ ON ALL DRIVES SINCE NO DRIVES WERE EVER DESIGNED TO
GO OUT THAT FAR).
     WHEN ALL TRACKS WHICH CONTAIN SOME TYPE OF DATA ARE LOCATED,  WE CAN MOVE
ON TO STEP 2.

STEP 2:
     NOW  WE  MUST  TELL NIBBLES AWAY ][ HOW TO READ THE  INFORMATION  ON  THE
TRACKS WHICH WE HAVE FOUND TO CONTAIN VALID DATA.   THIS IS DONE BY GOING BACK
TO  EACH  OF THESE TRACKS WITH THE TBE AND FINDING THE ADDRESS MARK  FOR  EACH
ONE.   THE ADDRESS MARK WILL BE THE FIRST 3 BYTES FOLLOWING THE GAP.   TO  SEE
THIS IN OPERATION, TAKE A LOOK AT A TRACK FROM YOUR SYSTEM MASTER DISK.  AFTER
EACH  GAP YOU WILL SEE EITHER 'D5 AA 96' FOR A DOS 3.3 MASTER DISK,  OR 'D5 AA
B5' FOR A DOS 3.2 DISK.   THESE VALUES SHOULD BE NOTED DOWN ALONGSIDE OF  EACH
TRACK NUMBER WHICH CONTAINS DATA.  MANY TIMES THERE WILL BE ONLY ONE, OR MAYBE
2 PATTERNS FOR ALL TRACKS.
     AFTER  THIS,  WE  ARE  READY TO BACK-UP THESE TRACKS.   THIS IS  DONE  BY
EXITING THE TBE (USE 'Q') AND THEN SELECTING 'M' FOR THE MODIFIERS MENU.  THEN
SELECT 'B' FOR BACKUP MODIFIER.   WHEN ASKED 'USE ADDRESS MARK' ANSWER 'Y' AND
THEN TYPE IN THE ADDRESS MARK WHICH YOU NOTED DOWN FOR THE RANGE OF TRACKS  TO
BE  BACKED-UP.   SIMPLY  PRESS  RETURN TO THE REST OF THE QUESTIONS  AND  THEN
RETURN TO THE MAIN MENU.   SELECT 'N' TO ENTER NIBBLES AWAY ][, AND ANSWER 'Y'
TO THE QUESTION 'CHANGE DEFAULT OPTIONS'.  USE THE <RETURN> KEY TO MOVE TO THE
'START TRACK' PROMPT,  AND THEN ENTER THE FIRST TRACK TO BE BACKED-UP.   PRESS
RETURN  AND  THEN  TYPE IN THE LAST TRACK TO BE  BACKED-UP  WITH  THE  CURRENT
ADDRESS  MARKER SETTING.   IF THE TRACKS IN THE SPECIFIED RANGE ARE NOT SPACED
AT  1  TRACK INTERVALS,  ENTER THE INTERVAL AT THE 'TRACK  INCREMENT'  PROMPT.
PRESS RETURN FOR THE FOLLOWING QUESTIONS AND BEGIN THE BACKUP AFTER  INSERTING
THE DISKS WHEN PROMPTED.   WHEN YOU RETURN TO THE MAIN MENU,  REPEAT THE ABOVE
PROCEDURE  FOR EACH RANGE OF TRACKS WHICH CONTAINS A DIFFERENT ADDRESS MARKER.
     NOW COMES THE MOMENT OF TRUTH!  TRY TO BOOT UP THE BACKED-UP DISK (IF THE
ORIGINAL  HAD A WRITE-PROTECT TAB,  THE BACK-UP SHOULD TOO!).   IF THE  BACKUP
BOOTS, THEN ALL WENT SUCCESFULLY.

STEP 3:
     IF THE BACK-UP DID NOT WORK PROPERLY THEN THERE ARE A FEW THINGS TO  LOOK
FOR.

1....DID  ALL  OF THE TRACKS WHICH SHOULD HAVE BACKED-UP DO SO?   THIS CAN  BE
     SEEN  WHILE THE BACK-UP TAKES PLACE AS A 'Y' OR AN 'N' UNDER THAT  TRACKS
     STATUS LOCATION.   IF SOME DID NOT,  THEN THE ADDRESS MARKER WAS PROBABLY
     NOT DETERMINED PROPERLY.   IF THIS IS THE CASE,  THEN GO BACK TO THE  TBE
     AND TRY THOSE TRACKS AGAIN.
2....IF EVERYTHING SEEMED TO GO WELL,  BUT THE BACKUP REFUSES TO WORK (YOU MAY
     WANT  TO TRY THE PROCEDURE AGAIN,  MAYBE WITH THE SOURCE AND  DESTINATION
     DRIVES  REVERSED,  TO  MAKE SURE IT WAS NOT A POWER GLITCH OR OTHER  SUCH
     OCCURANCE  WHICH MESSED THINGS UP) THE NEXT STEP IS TO TRY THE  PROCEDURE
     WITH  THE  'SYNCHRONIZED COPY' OPTION SELECTED.   DISKS  WHICH  USE  THIS
     METHOD  OFTEN  MAKE VIOLENT HEAD MOVEMENTS DURING THEIR  BOOT  PROCEDURE.
     THIS CAN BE A CLUE TO THIS TYPE OF PROTECTION.

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION:
     ON  SOME DOS 3.3 DISKETTES,  THE GAPS BETWEEN THE SECTORS ARE REDUCED  IN
SIZE.   IN  SOME  CASES  THEY  CAN  BE  AS  SMALL  AS  4  OR  5  BYTES.   WHEN
NIBBLES  AWAY ][ FINDS THE BEGINNING OF A SECTION OF DATA,  IT NORMALLY ADDS 8
BYTES  OF SYNC JUST BEFORE THE DATA.   THIS WILL NORMALLY PUT SYNC BYTES  INTO
THE  GAP BEFORE THE DATA,  WHERE IT SHOULD BE.   HOWEVER,  IF A DISK HAS  VERY
SMALL GAPS,  THEN THE ADDED SYNC CAN OVERWRITE THE END OF THE PREVIOUS SECTOR.
THE PARAMETER FIX AMNT CONTROLS THE NUMBER OF SYNC BYTES WHICH ARE  ADDED,  SO
THIS  VALUE  CAN BE REDUCED TO PREVENT ANY DATA FROM BEING  OVERWRITTEN.   THE
VALUE THAT NIBBLES AWAY ][ USES FOR THE SYNC WHICH IT PUTS IN IS CONTAINED  IN
THE  PARAMETER  FIX VALU.   NORMALLY THIS IS A $7F,  BUT IT CAN BE SET TO  ANY
DESIRED VALUE.
    IT  SHOULD BE NOTED THAT NIBBLES AWAY ][ REGARDS ANY DATA BYTE  WHICH  HAS
ITS HIGH BIT CLEARED TO BE A SYNC BYTE.   SO THE $7F WHICH IS NORMALLY IN THIS
PARAMETER MEANS THAT A SYNC $FF IS TO BE ADDED.  IF THE 'OVERIDE STANDARDIZER'
OPTION  IS  SELECTED,  THEN NIBBLES AWAY ][ WILL NOT ADD ANY  BYTES,  IT  WILL
SIMPLY  CONVERT THE DATA WHICH IS PRESENT BEFORE A SECTOR INTO  SYNC,  WITHOUT
CHANGING ITS VALUE.   THIS TECHNIQUE CAN ALSO BE USED FOR DISKS WHOSE GAPS ARE
VERY SMALL.

     ANOTHER  ITEM TO WATCH FOR IS DISKS WHOSE TRACKS APPEAR TO BE VERY  LONG.
SOME DISK PROTECTION SCHEMES PUT GARBAGE ON A PORTION OF THE TRACK.  WHEN THIS
GARBAGE  IS  READ BACK,  MORE BYTES ARE READ IN THAN WERE WRITTEN  OUT.   THIS
CAUSES  THE TRACK TO BE LONGER THAN NORMAL,  AND IN SOME CASES IT  BECOMES  SO
LONG  THAT  THE  DEFAULT PARAMETERS FOR NIBBLES AWAY ][ CANNOT FIND  THE  DATA
PROPERLY.   THE  PARAMETERS  DATA  MIN AND DATA MAX CONTROL  THE  MINUMUM  AND
MAXIMUM TRACK LENGTHS (IN INCREMENTS OF 256 BYTES) WHICH NIBBLES AWAY ][  WILL
ACCOMODATE.   THE  NORMAL VALUE OF DATA MAX IS $1D,  BUT THIS CAN BE SET TO  A
HIGHER VALUE,  SUCH AS $25,  IF A TRACK APPEARS TO BE VERY LONG.   EVEN THOUGH
THE  TRACK  MAY  READ IN AS A LARGE NUMBER OF BYTES,  MANY OF  THESE  WILL  BE
REMOVED BY THE NIBBLE FILTER,  SINCE THEY ARE GARBAGE BYTES.  THIS WILL ASSURE
THAT  THE  AMOUNT OF DATA WRITTEN BACK OUT WILL NOT BE TO LARGE TO FIT ON  THE
DESTINATION TRACK.

     WHEN NIBBLES AWAY ][ FINDS A SECTOR OF DATA, IT LOOKS FORWARD IN THE DATA
TO FIND A SECOND OCCURANCE OF THE SAME PATTERN.   THIS INSURES THAT THE SECTOR
HAS  BEEN READ IN AND LOCATED CORRECTLY.   ON MANY DISKS,  THERE IS A  PRIMARY
SECTION  OF  DATA,  CALLED THE ADDRESS FIELD,  AND THE THE ACTUAL  DATA  FIELD
FOLLOWS.   IN BETWEEN THESE IS A SMALL GAP,  AND MANY TIMES IT CONTAINS RANDOM
INFORMATION.   THIS MEANS THAT NIBBLES AWAY ][ SHOULD ONLY MATCH THE NUMBER OF
BYTES WHICH ARE FOUND IN THE ADDRESS FIELD, SINCE THE BYTES IN THE GAP MAY NOT
READ AS THE SAME VALUE EVERY TIME.  THE PARAMETER FIND MAX CONTROLS THE NUMBER
OF  BYTES WHICH ARE CHECKED DURING THIS PROCEDURE.   THE DEFAULT VALUE OF  $0C
WORKS  IN  MOST CASES,  BUT SOME DISKS USE A SMALLER ADDRESS FIELD  WHICH  MAY
REQUIRE  THIS  PARAMETER  TO BE SET TO A  SMALLER  VALUE.   HOWEVER,  IF  THIS
PARAMETER  IS SET TOO LOW,  THEN NIBBLES AWAY ][ MAY IDENTIFY THE MATCH FOR  A
SECTION OF DATA WHOSE FIRST FEW BYTES ARE THE SAME, BUT WHICH DIFFER LATER ON.
THEREFORE ONE SHOULD EXCERSIZE CAUTION WHEN LOWERING THIS VALUE.

         FUN STUFF FOR SYSOPS
---------------------------------------
First, you must be a sysop. 
(Obviously!) Or, you may be at a 
sysop's house (When he or she is not
around.)

Second, you must be VERY popular,
or VERY daring. Either way, your
victim will have a strong dendency
to: a) crash your board, b) hate you, 
or c) spread malicious rumors about
you, and, or your board to everyone
in the world that will listen.
 
    I am going to write about AE
fun first, and then Net-Worx. 
 
 
                AE Fun
                -- ---
 
    So you are bored, and want to
have some fun, huh?
    Go into your room, or wherever
you have your apple, and sit down.
Turn on the monitor, and lets see
if there is a leech on the line.
(-note: if you are the unlucky type,
I suggest that you give this up,
because for all you know, that sysop
of the 20meg board is on your line,
and he's going to be your victim!!)
   Now for some of these pranks, you
will need to make things before-
hand. I suggest you read this through,
and make the necessary mods. 
 
1) This one is probably my meanest
trick, and should only be used on
people like Matt Ackerett, or Little
Al.
   Your victim has to be leeching
a game off of your AE for this to
work.
   You wait until your victim is at
his last 2 blocks of memeory to go
until the transfer is done, and
you take out the disk. 
   This will ruin the >entire<
transmission. It won't piss them off
too bad if it is only 50 or so blocks,
but can you imagine:
 
Send: Matt Ackerett is a fag
290 blocks
crc=167
<289>
 
    Note- The victim has to get 290
blocks, you only let the victim get
289!
 
 
   At that point, take out the disk!
They have just waited 1/2 hour for
nothing! They can't get the last block
and have to go through the whole
thing again!! Ha ha!  
   This is very mean, especially if
they aren't phreaking, they have
been >paying< for it all!
 
             
2) If you want to see if the person
on is intelligent...simply let him
catalog your drive once, then when he
is done, take the disk out, and 
put in the disk from the other drive.
When they catalog the disk next, it 
will be different!
   This will freak them out, they will
think that they have switched to d1
somehow. The victim will then L)og the
drive, and find it still on D2. Wow!
   Hopefully they will catalog D1 
anyway, thinking that they were
originally on D1 and it switched.
Now comes the fun. 
   Put the right disk back in D2, 
and put the disk that used to be in D2
into D1, so they will get the same 
catalog.
   Now they are confused. Now
they will catalog D2, and find the
normal stuff. Hopefull they will
read something, now take the disk
out while they are typing in the name,
and slip the other disk in. It
will say 'file not found.'
   Good. Now they will catalog it,
and look! The wares have changed!
Now something is wrong here! They
will say:
 
hey! stop it!
 
   Oh no! They are on to your scheme!
But, 1 last joke! Get a copy-protected
type disk, one that you <gasp> bought.
They won't be able to catalog this
at all! Ha!
   If they get mad, they might
say something like:
 
        Hey! Stop it!
   
   But will you listen? nnnoooooo!
Take the disk out, and slip something
totally new, preferably the disk that
has "sneakers" or some ancient wares.
Maybe they will think these are the
latest! Watch them post!:
 
      Hey! I just got some new 
      Warez! Do you want to trade??
 
hah hah!
 
  Satisfied, you may put the normal
disks back in and walk off to see
some football game.
 
3) Lock out the space-bar. This will
make it so that they can't type a
<space>. Then, they can't read
anything that requires a space. 
Most likely the victim will think that
there is something wrong with >his< 
computer. Thusly sending him/her/it
into a 1/2 hour scan of their install
program to see what is wrong.
 
4) Change the commands...such as:
 
d)irectory= c)irectory
-           -
 
   They will have to hack at the 
commands! This won't be too funny,
because they won't do anything stupid
like posting:
 
     hey your commands are screwed!
  
   Most likely they wont find the 
command for 'copy'.
 
 
5) lock out the "ctrl-c". This will
piss them off when the victim just
can't exit from posting. Ha!
 
6) Change the ring count, most, or
almost >all< AE lines are set to 
pick up after just 1 ring. Change it
to...say...5 rings, and only tell your
friends that it is at 5 rings. When
they call, they will only wait for 
about 2 rings, and hang up thinking
that the line is down. Only the people
you like will get on, because they 
will be the only ones to wait 5 rings.
Mean huh?
 
7) When someone is posting, or c)opy-
ing a message, pick up the voice line,
and blow into the reciever. This will
put all of these weird characters onto
the screen. He will save a gay looking
message, that will make it look like
the victim can't type!! 
 
 
               Net Works
               --- -----
 
   I don't have as many fun tricks
with net-worx as I do with AE, but
here are a couple of my favorites...
 
1) In the program, make a bug, like
"ctrl-k" that when pushed (like ctrl-t
for chat) it will dump you into basic.
take out the disks, and put in like 
the "bare-bones" net-worx disk and let
them have fun reading fake messages,
mail, and passwords. Ooooh! They will
think:
 
oh yay! I have everyone's pass!
 
Now, see if he/she will init the 
disks, if they do, you know what type
of user it is. If they are nice,
and 'hang' the line for you so that
no one wil be able to get on after,
or they try to beep you, then give 
them a level raise.
 
2) Be a tyrant. Juggle their levels
while they are on. Like break into
chat, change their level, and watch
them get all mad. 
 
3) Break into chat, and just walk off,
leaving a frustrated user sitting
there.
 
4) break into chat, and change the
time. In other words, leave them
with -10 minutes, instead of 35 or
so.
 
5) when they log off, and they get
that stupid message about:
 
            Thank you for
              calling
 
and all of that, press 'ctrl-c' a
few times, and they will be brought
back. Wow! What happened? Let them
try to log off a few times nd keep
pressing ctrl-c. Finally they should
just press 'reset'. He he!
 
 
    I hope you have enjoyed these
little pranks. Your users will hate
you if you do this too often, unless
they are like Matt Ackeret or Little
Al. Then it doesn't matter much.
    Remember! I hold no responsibilty
for people wanting to crash your 
system because they are so pissed
at you!

IT SEEMS THERE'S A DEMAND FOR A W/P
SWITCH ON THE ANDROMEDA -- SO HERE IT
IS ...
 
 LOCATED ON THE ANDROMEDA RAM CARD IS
 A PIN NUMBER 25 WHICH HAPPENS TO BE 
 THE POWER (+5V) PIN. IF THIS PIN IS
 FOLLOWED ONTO THE PC BOARD, THERE WILL
 BE TWO RESISTORS (SMALL TUBE-LIKE 
THINGS WITH COLOR BANDS AND ONE LEAD
OUT OF EACH END). AT ONE END THE POWER
WILL GO INTO THIS RESISTOR, AT THE OTHE
R ANOTHER TRACE WILL GO OFF TO SOME
OF THE OTHER ELECTRONICS ON THE BOARD.
WE WANT TO USE THE END THAT HAS THE
TRACES GOING TO OTHER CHIPS ON THE 
BOARD. (CALL THIS POINT #1 (USE EITHER
RESISTOR - THERE ARE TWO)). POINT NUMBE
R TWO IS WHERE PIN 18 FROM THE APPLE
CONNECTOR (7 PINS DOWN FROM 25 ON THE
SAME SIDE) ENTERS ONTO THE PC BOARD
AND IMMEDIATELY GOES THROUGH TO THE
OTHER SIDE (AFTER ABT 1/2 "). THIS
IS POINT #2.  IF YOU TRACE WHERE TH
E THING COMES OUT ON THE OTHER SIDE, 
YOU'LL FIND OUT THAT IT POPS BACK ON
THE SIDE IT STARTED FROM ABOUT 1/2" 
LATER... THIS LITTLE LINK IS WHEERE WE
CUT THE TRACE TO INSERT THE SWITCH.
OK, WE CUT THE TRACE BETWEEN THE TWO
POINTS THAT IT GOES THROUGH THE PC
BOARD. LABEL THE OTHER PLACE WHERE THE
TRACE GOES THROUGH POINT#3.  NOW WE
WILL ATTACH AN SPDT SWITCH TO THE BOARD
 SOLDER ONE WIRE TO POINT 3, AND ATTACH
IT TO THE CENTER TERMINAL OF THE SWITCH
THEN SOLDER A WIRE TO POINT 1 AND 
ATTACH IT TO EITHER SIDE OF THE CENTER
SWITCH. LASTLY, TAKE A WIRE AND SOLDER
IT TO POINT 2 AND THEN TO THE UNUSED
PIN ON THE SWITCH. THERE YOU HAVE IT!
WHEN THE SWITCH HANDLE IS ON THE SAME
SIDE AS THE WIRE FROM POINT #1, REG-
ULAR OPERATION WILL TAKE PLACE. IF THE
SWITCH IS THROWN IN THE OTHER DIRECTION
THE CARD WILL BE WRITE PROTECTED.

b          = Board has been busy for a while and we didn't get through

3/12       = Board runs at both 300 and 1200 baud

Please only call boards during their stated operating hours!

To the Sysop: How We Compile This List
--------------------------------------
Every two months or so, we go through our current list of confirmed and
reputed ae's and CALL EVERY ONE TWICE; once on a weekend, then a second
time a week later.  All calls are made during the board's claimed operating
schedule.  If the number RINGS both times we call, the AE is removed from
the list (we usually allow 5 or 6 rings when we're checking numbers).  If
the number is BUSY it stays on the list.  For this reason, if you are a sysop
and your board is down temporarily we ask that you leave your phone off the
hook during operating hours if you want your board to remain on the list.
If you decide to go down for good, PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE call the phone company
and have the line disconnected, or your number changed.  This makes it easier
for everyone involved, as constantly ringing numbers are an annoyance to all
of us.  Better yet, let us know, and we'll do our best to eliminate unwanted
late-night wake-up calls.

DISCLAIMER:  We can't be responsible for mistakes unless you have called
             them to our attention.  If there is a problem with the entry
             for your AE then call us and let us know.  We'll fix it!
             Remember, we aren't perfect yet!

AN INTERESTING MESSAGE POSTED ON TEXCON
CAUGHT MY EYE..IN LIGHT OF THE NAZI BBS
THE MOLESTERS BBS AND THE BUST IN N.J..
A NEW FEDERAL LAW THAT WOULD OUTLAW OR
SEVERELY RESTRICT BBS ACTIVITY IS BEING
PUSHED THROUGH CONGRESS, ACCORDING TO 
TWO SOURCES THE METAL DETECTOR AND JOHN
EDENS. ANOMG THE RESTRICTIONS DISCUSSED
ARE: *REGISTRATION OF ALL BBS AS PUBLIC
      UTILITIES.
     *SYSOPS REQUIRED TO KEEP LOGS OF 
      ALL USERS "VERIFIED" NAMES AND
      ADDRESSES.
     *SYSOPS REQUIRED TO KEEP LOGS OF
      ALL MESSAGE POSTINGS AND TIMES OF
      POSITNG
     *CRIMINAL PENALTIES FOR SYSOPS WHO
      ALLOW ILLEGAL MESSAGE POSTINGS
      WHETHER OR NOT THEY HAVE KNOW OF
      THE CONTENT OR HAVE HAD A CHANCE
      TO REMOVE IT.
     *BBS USERS WOULD BE "REQUIRED" TO
      USE THEIR LEGAL NAMES.
I HAVE NO WAY TO BE SURE THIS DATA IS 
CORRECT, BUT I SUSPECT IT IS CLOSE TO 
THE TRUTH. CONTACT YOUR CONGRESSIONAL
REPRESENTATIVE, THEY ALMOST ALL HAVE 
800 #'S, AND FIND OUT AND EXPRESS YOUR
OPINION, TOO, WHILE YOU HAVE THE CHANCE

IS SO DAMN UNCONSTITUTIONAL IT MAKES ME SICK.  THE SYSOP SHOULD NOT BE HELD
RESPONSIBLE FOR MESSAGES, HE IS PROTECTED BY THE FIRST AMENDMENT.  IT'LL
NEVER PASS.
 
THE WARLOCK LORD
WHEW-

WHAT A YEAR SO FAR-
BOARDS BEING BUSTED THROUGHOUT THE U.S.
NEW COMPUTER CRIME LAWS BEING ABUSED BY
COPS IN MOST STATES (THOUGH MOST OF THESE LAWS CERTAINLY WILL PROVE
UN-CONSTITUTIONAL IF EVER TAKEN TO THE SUPREME COURT).
AND-NEW FEDERAL LAWS IN THE FEDERAL SUB-COMMITTEES WAITIN TO BE VOTED ON!
ALSO,YE SECRET SERVICE HAS TAKEN OVER
FEDERAL COMPUTER INVESTIGATIONS FROM
THE FBI.

SEEMS LIKE EVERY PREDICTION I MADE IN
EARLIER ISSUES HAS COME TRUE!

NOW LET ME TELL YA WHATS HAPPENIN AND
WHY. THE FEDS KNOW EVERYTHING IS GOIN
COMPUTER IN THE NEAR FUTURE,AND NATURALLY LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCYS WANTED THE
WORST LAWS POSSIBLE ON THE BOOKS SO
THEY COULD RUN AMOK WITHOUT ANY CONCERN
OF OUR CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS.
SINCE OUR LEGISLATORS KNOW LITTLE OF
COMPUTER HAPPENINGS,YE SNEAKY FEDS 
DECIDED TO RAID VIRTUALLY EVERY KID
THAT RAN A GOOD BOARD THIS SPRING.
NATURALLY,THEY SPENT MEGA-THOUSANDS
ON THESE RAIDS AND THEN WERE KIND
ENOUGH TO MIS-INFORM THE PRESS AS
TO FABLES LIKE HACKERS MOVIN SATELITES,
ETC.NOW WHEN OUR INK HUNGRY MEDIA GOT
HOLD OF ALL THESE LIES, THEY TRUMP
EM UP EVEN FURTHER IN A BLITZ THAT
INCLUDED FRONT PAGE HEADLINES,UPI,
AND NATIONAL TV.
 O.K. SO HERE SITS MR & MRS CITIZEN
BELIEVIN THAT GARBAGE AN CALLIN MR
CONGRESSMAN SCREAMIN BLOODY MURDER.
 AN YA CAN GUESS WHATS HAPPENIN NOW-
YEP-THEYRE TRYIN TO DEPRIVE US OF
CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS (1ST & 4TH
AMMENDMENTS) THROUGH NEW PENDING
LEGISLATION......

NOW YA SAY-WHAT CAN BE DONE?

OK-WRITE EVERY CONGRESSMAN IN YOUR
STATE AND ALSO OTHER STATES AN EVEN
THE PRESIDENT TELLIN THEM YOU DONT
WANT ANY LAWS PASSED THAT WILL
INFRINGE ON YOUR RIGHTS RE COMPUTERS.
MASS PRODUCE THOSE LETTERS & SEND EM
OUT NOW-THESE BAD LAWS CAN ONLY BE
STOPPED BY DOIN SOMETHING RIGHT AWAY.

ALSO-BITCH ABOUT SPENDING ALL OUR
TAX MONEY HARASSING KIDS.THERE IS
A LOT OF CROOKS RUNNIN ROUND THEY
SHOULD BE AFTER WITH THOSE FEDERAL
AGENTS.

AND MAKE UP PETITIONS SIGNED BY 
ANYONE FROM ADULTS TO YOUR CLASSMATES
TO SEND IN ALSO. HECK-SEND THOSE
LETTERS IN EVERY WEEK TILL WE GET
RESULTS.ALSO-POST THIS FILE EVERYWHERE.

'T' INDICATES A TRACK NUMBER.  WHEN A
RANGE OF TRACKS ARE TO BE COPIED, YOU
WILL SEE "TX-TXX".  THIS MEANS SET THE
START TRACK TO "X", AND THE END TRACK
TO "XX".  IF ONLY A SINGLE TRACK IS TO
BE COPIED, YOU WILL SEE "TX".  THIS
MEANS USE "X" FOR BOTH START AND END
TRACKS.  NUMBERS TO THE RIGHT ARE
PARAMETER CHANGES THAT SHOULD BE MADE
BEFORE COPYING THE TRACKS SHOWN.
"STEP" MEANS TRACK INCREMENT.

WHEN MAKING A BACKUP, BE SURE TO FOLLOW
THE STEPS IN ORDER.  OFTEN A PARAMETER
WILL NOT BE RE-LISTED IF IT IS SET FOR
A PRIOR RANGE OF TRACKS.

IF A PARAMETER LISTING INCLUDES "SECTOR
EDIT", USE THE COPY II PLUS SECTOR EDIT
OR TO MODIFY THE TRACK AND SECTOR
SHOWN.  BE SURE TO PATCH THE READ/WRITE
ROUTINES IF THE LISTING SHOWS "PATCHED"
AND TO USE THE CORRECT DOS (3.2 OR 3.3)
.

SOME DISKETTES CAN BE DUPLICATED USING
THE DEFAULT PARAMETERS (OR COPY DISK
FROM THE MAIN MENU).  IF THE DISKETTE
YOU WISH TO BACKUP IS NOT LISTED, TRY
THE DEFAULT SETTINGS OR COPY DISK FIRST

A "*" NEXT TO THE PRODUCT NAME IN-
DICATES THESE PARAMETERS WERE USER
SUBMITTED AND HAVE NOT BEEN VERIFIED BY

OUR CUSTOMERS TO LET US KNOW WHEN THEY
BACKUP A DISK NOT ON THIS LIST.  THIS

        DOS Notes & Pointers..
        ======================

        -=> By THE FREEZE <=-

Suggested reading: Beneath Apple DOS
                   The DOS Manual

Needed equipment: Apple, Drive
                  IQ > 60

  I will start this article by giving
you an overview of what is in DOS and
what it does. First of all there is
the RWTS. This allows you to read or
write a sector at a time. All oper-
ations are done either directly or
indirectly through this. Starting at
$B600 and ending at $BFFF RWTS takes
up about 2.5K. Next is the File
Manager. This goes from $AAC9 to $B5FF
This is a bunch of subroutines which
execute your commands from basic.
Then there are the main DOS routines.
These interpret your commands and tell
the file manager what to do, which in
turn uses the RWTS to do them. These
routines go from $9D00 to $AAC8.
When you have MAXFILES set to 3, DOS
reserves memory from $9600 to $9CFF.
Setting MAXFILES higher will take up
more memory, lower than $9600.
There is another part of DOS, which
resides in the latter part of page 3
or from $3D0 to $3FF. This is called
the Dos Vector Table. I will go into
detail on that later.

 Well now, lets say you put a disk in
the drive and turned your computer on.
Then you loaded a file, edited it and
saved it. Why don't we take a look and
see exactly what is happening.

 When you turn your computer on (if
you have autostart) the code on your
drive controller prom takes over.
This loads in a routine at $800.
This is called Boot 0. Then it jumps
to $801 and executes that code (boot
1). That code loads in sectors 1
through 9 which in turn loads in the
rest of DOS. Then it looks to see if
you have a HELLO program and jumps
to it. The first thing it does when
loading in a program, in this case
the HELLO program, is look at the
catalog track. Then after it finds
the file and the track and sector it
starts on, it reads in the first
sector. The first sector of a program
is called the Track Sector List or
TSL. This is a listing of all tracks
and sectors that have data for that
program. DOS reads this into memory
and then starts loading the program
in. But where does it know where to
load the program in and how does it
know what file type it is?
The file type was back on the catalog,
more (lots more) on that later...
On the first sector of data, not the
TSL, in the first two bytes is the
address to start loading in at. These
bytes as usual are in reverse order.
Well, now you know a little of how
DOS works. Lets go into more detail.

 Here is where I will probably lose
you. If it gets confusing hang on.
 Now we will look at track $11, which
is the catalog track. The VTOC or
Volume Table Of Contents is stored
at track $11, sector $00. This tells
DOS such things as: what sectors are
free, volume #, DOS version, first
link to catalog sector...
Bytes $01 & $02 of the VTOC tells us
 where to find the
first catalog sector. This usually is
track $11, sector $0F. Byte $02 is
the DOS version. Either a "1", "2",
"3", for DOS 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, consec-
utively. Byte $07 is the volume #
usually $FE (254). The next thing of
interest is the Bit Map. Starting at
byte $38 you will see "FFFF0000".
For now, ignore the last two bytes.
The "FFFF" is a binary representation
of what sectors are free on a certain
track. In the two bytes there are
16 bits. Makes sense doesn't it, 16
bits and 16 sectors. If the bit is
set or a "1" then that sector is free.
If it is a "0" then it's used.
Now lets look at the catalog link.
On track $11, sector $0F, byte $01,
are two bytes that tell what track
and sector to find the first catalog
sector. This is almost always track 11
sector $0F. On track $11, sector $0F,
bytes 1 and 2, is a pointer to the
next sector, track $11, sector $0E.
The links continue until sector $01
where you will see zero's in those
bytes. I have been asked many times
how to get more than 105 files onto
a disk. If you edit the second and
third bytes on track $11, sector $01
to "100F", you will be able to use
track $10, sector $0F for a catalog
sector. You can continue on track
10 sector F and make a link to the
next sector and so on. Be sure to
mark it on the bit map or it will
get wiped out when DOS has to write
there. Well, we have covered most
of the VTOC, lets look at how the
catalog sectors are formatted.

 Starting at byte $0B on any catalog
sector, is the entry for a file.
The first two bytes after that, tells
what track and sector the program
starts on. Then is the file type (more
on that later). Next comes the file
name, up to 30 characters. The last
byte before the next entry tells us
how many sectors the file takes.
This usually never goes over 255
sectors, however text files can take
more than 255 sectors. Now we can
look at the file type. We have to look
at this at the binary level. If the
first bit is set, it is a text file.
If the second is set, it's Integer.
Third is applesoft, fourth is binary.
If the eigth or MSB is set, the file
is locked. It's really quite simple.
$00 means a text file. $80 means a
locked text file. If it is a $84,
we have a locked binary file.

 Now for the complicated stuff, how
DOS writes sectors, INITs a disk,
the "6 & 2" split. Lets say you put a
blank disk in the drive, initialized
it, and saved a file onto it. Lets see
what happens. First off, at $A54F is
the INIT routine. If you did A54FG
from monitor, it would INIT your disk
without a hello program. This lets
your disk boot faster because it does
not have to load in that file.
Ok. So you type in "INIT HELLO". DOS
takes over and starts formatting your
disk starting with track 0 and ending
with track $23. Then it writes the
catalog track and VTOC. Last it writes
in DOS. Lets take a close look at a
disk at the track level. First off we
have what is called a GAP. This is made
up of "FF"'s. Then we have the prolouge
marks, ye olde "D5 AA 96". After that
comes the volume, track, sector, check-
sum, epilouge "DE AA EB". Then comes a
smaller GAP with a different prolouge
"D5 AA AD". Then $342 bytes of user
data. Oops! $342 bytes of user data?
I thought there were only $FF or 255
bytes per sector! (more on this later).
Then we have the checksum. And last
we have the epilouge "DE AA EB".
There are certain bytes that DOS
doesn't write as data. These bytes are
used in proulouge and epilouge marks.
DOS looks for these when trying to find
a sector. Now for the "6 & 2" split.
The hardware on the apple doesn't allow
for more than $3F different bytes to
be written. That's why they used the
"5 & 3" split on 3.2 disks. What that
means is that from one byte, five bits
are taken out and form one byte. The
other three bits form one byte also.
The six and two split is the same thing
as the five and three but allows for
more combinations.

 Now for a little on copy protection.
Back in the good 'ol days we could just
demuffin everything. All they had was
a modified DOS or changed address marks
etc. After that they got a little
smarter and some wrote their own DOS
or used a modified RWTS. But nothing
stops us pirates, all you had to do
is read in data through their RWTS and
write it back out standard. Then they
got dirty, using the text page and the
input buffer for data or code. They
even used the stack (page 1) for code.
To get around this, NMI card like
crackshot and cracking chips were made.
these dumped all memory to disk allow-
ing the text page and the input buffer
to be undisturbed. The newest thing
seems to be SPIRAL TRACKING. The first
game I saw this on was Maze Craze.
Cracking it was quite easy though. All
you had to do is cut out one part of
disk access (at $855) that wasn't even
needed. But who knows what we will be
up against in the future.

 I suggest you read "Beneath Apple DOS"
 and look at the DOS manual supplied
with your Apple. This is for beginners
or people who are too lazy to read
a book...

 I would appreciate lots of questions,
I may not have made myself too clear
or you may want to know more about
a certain area. Just leave me e-mail.

   The Freeze

       D O S     T R I C K S        
 
 TRY THIS TO SEE ANY DOS, REMOVE THE
REAR MOST SET OF RAM CHIPS FROM YOUR
APPLE (THE ONES NEAR THE I/O SLOTS).
THEN INIT A DISK, REPLACE THE RAM AND
BOOT UP UNDER THE PROGRAM YOU WISH TO
DEPROTECT. THEN FORCE A REBOOT WITH THE
DISK YOU INITED IN DRIVE 1. THE DOS 
FROM THE PROTECTED DISK WILL (IN MOST
CASES) STILL BE IN THE RAM UP TOP....
 
THIS NEW DOS IS A SLAVE AT 32 K AND
THE OLD (AND PROTECTED DOS) IS STILL
AT 48 K. THIS WILL WORK ON ABOUT 50%
OF THE PROGRAMS.  ENJOY
 

YOU CAN ALSO REMOVE THE TOP 32K AND
GET TWICE AS MUCH.

=======================================
CHECKSUM TRICK

A  VERY  HANDY TECHNIQUE FOR  TAKING  A
LOOK AT THE DATA ON A PROTECTED DISK IS
TO  DISABLE  THE CHECKSUM IN THE  RWTS.
THE  FORMATS  OF MANY  PROTECTED  DISKS
VARY ONLY IN THIS CHECKSUM,  SO TURNING
IT   OFF  SHOULD  ALLOW  ANY   STANDARD
TRACK/SECTOR  UTILITY  TO LOOK  AT  THE
DISK!  TO DO THIS, BOOT UP THE DOS THAT
YOU WISH TO USE, AND ENTER THE MONITOR.
THEN  ENTER   B942:18 FOR  DOS  3.3  OR
B963:18  FOR DOS 3.2.   THIS CHANGES  A
SET  CARRY INSTRUCTION TO A CLEAR CARRY
INSTRUCTION.  NOW RETURN TO DOS AND RUN
YOUR  EDITOR.   IF  THE  DISK  YOU  ARE
LOOKING  AT  IS  PROTECTED  WITH   THIS
SYSTEM,  YOU  SHOULD BE ABLE TO READ IT
NOW. TO MAKE  THIS CHANGE TO A DOS ON A
DISK, THIS DATA IS CONTAINED IN TRACK 0
SECTOR  3,  AT EITHER BYTE $42 OR  BYTE
$63, FOR DOS 3.3 OR 3.2, RESPECTIVELY.
GOOD LUCK.......
                     RANDY

=======================================

TO AVOID RE-LOADING THE LANGUAGE CARD
ON BOOTUP ( A MAJOR IRRITATION )
CHANGE THE FOLLOWING :
 
 
IN A 48K SYSTEM, CHANGE $BFCC TO 00 AND
$BFCF TO 00 : THIS WILL PREVENT THE 
LANGUAGE CARD FROM BEING WRITTEN TO.
(INITIALIZE A DISKETTE WITH THIS DO
 TO MAKE IT BOOT UP IN THIS FASHION)
 
(IF YOU LOOK AT THE CODE, YOU CAN MAKE 
THE SAME MODS IN A COPY OF A SYST
MASTER ON THE DISK ITSELF, SO A MASTER
CREATE WILL PUT THIS DOS ON A DISKETTE.
CHANGE THE CODE THAT SAYS LDA C081 WITH
LDA C000 -- THAT SSHOULD WORK FINE.
 
=======================================

GET INTO MONITOR FROM A NORMAL DISK.
TYPE:   400<A800.ABFFM
 
POOF THERE YOU HAVE ALL THE DOS COMANDS
NOTICE THAT ALL THE LETTERS IN THE
COMAND ARE FLASHING BUT THE LAST ONE
THAT IS TO TELL YOU WHERE THE COMAND
ENDS. NOW NOTICE WHERE THE INIT,LOAD,
BLOAD,SAVE,BSAVE,CATALOG, ETC...
THEN BOOT SOMETHING LIKE BRAIN SURGEON
OR SOMETHING THAT HAS SOMETHING LIKE
A NORMAL FORMAT THEN TYPE THAT LINE
AND THEN YOU CAN SEE IF THEY CHANGED
ANY OF THE COMANDS!

WHICH REPRESENT SPECIFIC DATA CATAGORIE
TO THE SYSTEM WHEN INPUT BY THE USER. 
AN EXAMPLE OF A PREFIX IS "TN"WHICH 
MEANS "TELEPHONE NUMBER". AN INPUT 
FORMAT DETERMINES THE NUMBER OF CHARAC-
TERS FOLLOWING A PREFIX AS WELL AS THE
PATTERN IN WHICH THESE MUST BE ENTERED.
FOR EXAMPLE, "TN XXX-XXXX" MEANS THAT 
THE PREFIX "TN" MUST BE FOLLOWED BY 
SEVEN CHARACTERS IN THE FORMAT SHOWN.
 
INPUT VALUES ARE THE ALLOWABLE DATA
ENTERED FOR EACH PREFIX IN THE CORRECT
INPUT FORMAT. AS MENTIONED IN THE 
PREVIOUS PARAGRAPH THE INPUT FORMAT
FOR THE PREFIX "TN" IS "TN XXX-XXXX"
THE FIRST THREE CHARACTERS (XXX) MUST
BE ALPHANUMERIC; THE LAST FOUR (XXXX)
MUST BE NUMERIC. SO, COSMOS WOULD CON-
SIDER AN INPUT OF "TN 935-2481" AS
VALID INPUT. BUT YOU *MUST* USE THE
CORRECT WIRE CENTER FOR THE (XXX) IN 
QUESTION. IN HACKING COSMOS PART 2
LEX WILL HAVE A LIST OF THE MOST 
COMMONLY USED PREFIXES, FORMATS AND
PREFIX CODE VALUES WHICH ENABLE YOU
TO READ AND UNDERSTAND COSMOS TRANS-
ACTIONS.

COSNIX IS THE OPERATING SYSTEM OF THE
COSMOS SYSTEM. 
SYSTEM COMMANDS------AS SOME OF YOU 
WILL NOTICE, IF YOU READ THE BASICS OF
HACKING II, BY THE KNIGHTS OF SHADOW, 
ALOT OF THE COMMANDS USED ON UNIX ARE 
ALSO USED ON COSMOS. COMMANDS ARE AS 
FOLLOWS::
WHERE---GIVES LOCATION OF THE SYSTEM::
        THIS COMMAND CAN BE VERY USEFUL
        SINCE YOU CAN GO TRASHING AT 
        THE LOCATION THAT THE CENTER IS
        AT.

THAT IS ALL FOR PART 1, IT SHOULD GIVE
YOU A BASIC UNDERSTANDING OF COSMOS.
PART 2 WILL EXPLAIN AND SHOW YOU HOW TO
HOOK UP PHONE #'S AND SEE WHAT EQUIPMNT

             STEP BY STEP GUIDE TO BACKING-UP DISKS
                              WITH
                         NIBBLES AWAY ][

     THERE ARE THREE BASIC STEPS TO BACKUP A DISKETTE:

1. LOCATE THE TRACKS WHICH CONTAIN DATA.
2. FIND THE ADDRESS MARKER FOR THE SECTORS THERE.
3. FIGURE OUT ANY ADDITIONAL PROTECTION.

(HINT: #3 IS THE HARD ONE!)

     FOR  MOST  OF  THE PROCEDURES BELOW,  A BASIC WORKING  KNOWLEDGE  OF  THE
TRACK/BIT EDITOR (TBE) IS REQUIRED.   FOR THOSE WHO ARE NOT FAMILIAR WITH  THE
TBE,  AN OVERALL DESCRIPTION AND SOME EXAMPLES ARE GIVEN BELOW.   THE EXAMPLES
ARE  EASIER TO UNDERSTAND IF THEY ARE PERFORMED AS YOU READ THIS,  SO YOU  MAY
WANT TO BOOT UP NIBBLES AWAY ][ AND TRY THEM OUT TO GET A BETTER UNDERSTANDING
OF WHAT IS GOING ON.

     ENTER  THE  TBE  BY SELECTING OPTION 'T' FROM THE  MAIN  MENU.   A  LARGE
SECTION  OF  NUMBERS WILL APPEAR ON THE SCREEN,  WITH TWO DASHED LINES AT  THE
TOP.   THE  INFORMATION IN BETWEEN THESE LINES IS THE STATUS  INFORMATION  AND
INFORMS YOU OF SUCH THINGS AS CURSOR POSITION,  TRACK NUMBER,  AND IS ALSO THE
LOCATION  WHERE VARIOUS PROMPTS APPEAR FOR CERTAIN FUNCTIONS.   THE NUMBERS AT
THE  BOTTOM  ARE SEPARATED INTO TWO SECTIONS.   ON THE LEFT ARE  THE  STARTING
MEMORY  ADDRESS'S FOR EACH LINE TO THE RIGHT.   MOVE THE CURSOR  AROUND  USING
I,J,K OR M, AND WATCH THE ADDR INDICATOR IN THE STATUS LINE.  IT WILL TELL YOU
EXACTLY WHAT MEMORY ADDRESS THE VALUE UNDER THE CURSOR REPRESENTS.   THE ARROW
KEYS  CHANGE THE AREA OF MEMORY WHICH YOU CAN SEE.   THEY SHIFT YOUR VIEW  256
BYTES FORWARD OR BACKWARD AT A TIME.   THE ONLY REALLY IMPORTANT THING TO KNOW
FOR  THIS DISCUSSION IS HOW TO USE THE ARROW KEYS TO MOVE THE VIEWING 'WINDOW'
AROUND IN MEMORY.
     THE  ';'  (UNSHIFTED '+') AND THE '-' KEYS INCREMENT  AND  DECREMENT  THE
TRACK  NUMBER IN THE STATUS LINE.   PRESSING 'R' WILL CAUSE DRIVE ONE TO  READ
THE  DATA FROM THE TRACK INDICATED IN THE STATUS LINE INTO MEMORY.   THE BYTES
ON THE SCREEN WILL CHANGE,  SINCE DIFFERENT DATA HAS BEEN READ  IN.   PRESSING
THE  'R'  KEY  MULTIPLE TIMES WILL RESULT IN DIFFERENT DATA  BEING  DISPLAYED.
THIS IS BECAUSE NIBBLES AWAY ][ STARTS READING AT WHATEVER POINT HAPPENS TO BE
UNDER THE HEAD WHEN THE DRIVE IS TURNED ON,  WHICH IS RANDOM, HENCE THE CHANGE
IN  THE  DISPLAYED DATA (THE DATA IS NOT ACTUALLY DIFFERENT,  IT IS  JUST  NOT
LOADED AT THE SAME MEMORY LOCATION AS IT WAS PREVIOUSLY).

STEP 1:
     TO  DO  THIS WE MUST LOCATE ALL OF THE TRACKS ON THE DISK  WHICH  CONTAIN
DATA.   TO DO THIS WE SHOULD HAVE THE TRACK POINTER SET TO TRACK 00.  PRESSING
'R'  WILL READ IN THE TRACK AND SHOW IT ON THE SCREEN.   THE ARROW KEYS SHOULD
BE  USED  TO MOVE THE VIEWING 'WINDOW' TO START AT $2000.   NOW WE  WILL  MOVE
FORWARD  AND TRY TO DETERMINE IF THIS TRACK CONTAINS  VALID  DATA.   ACTUALLY,
TRACK 00 MUST CONTAIN SOME DATA IN ORDER FOR THE DISK TO BOOT,  BUT WE WILL BE
USING THIS PROCEDURE ON OTHER TRACKS WHICH DO NOT NECESSARILY CONTAIN DATA.
     THE  MAIN  THING  WHICH WILL IDENTIFY A TRACK AS CONTAINING DATA  IS  THE
PRESENCE OF GAPS.   GAPS ARE SECTIONS OF THE SAME BYTE REPEATED SEVERAL TIMES.
NORMALLY THEY ARE MADE UP OF $FF'S AND ARE 6-20 IN LENGTH.   TO SEE WHAT THESE
LOOK  LIKE,  INSERT YOUR SYSTEM MASTER DISK AND READ IN TRACK 00 AS  DESCRIBED
ABOVE.   MOVING  THROUGH  THE BUFFER WITH THE ARROW KEYS WILL REVEAL  A  LARGE
VARIETY  OF VALUES.   SPACED OUT AMONG THESE SHOULD BE SECTIONS OF FF'S  WHICH
CONTAIN ABOUT 6-20 IN A ROW,  DEPENDING ON THE EXACT DISK.   NORMALLY DOS  3.2
DISKS HAVE LARGER GAPS THAN DOS 3.3 DISKS.  THERE SHOULD BE MANY OCCURANCES OF
THE  GAPS,  SPACED OUT SO THAT YOU SEE ONE ABOUT EVERY OTHER TIME THAT YOU USE
THE ARROW KEYS TO MOVE FORWARD OR BACKWARD.

NOTE:YOU  MAY SEE A SECOND,  SMALLER (2-5 $FF'S),  GAP FOLLOWING A LARGE  GAP,
     WITH  A SMALL SECTION OF DATA IN BETWEEN.   THIS IS CALLED THE  SECONDARY
     GAP.   WHEN  REFERING TO A GAP HERE,  WE WILL ALWAYS BE TALKING ABOUT THE
     PRIMARY GAP, NOT THE SECONDARY ONE.

     NOW TRY LOOKING AT OTHER TRACKS ON THE DISK.  FIRST LOOK ONLY AT THE FULL
TRACKS  (NO .5 ON THE END).   ALL OF THEM WILL BE SIMILAR TO TRACK 00  IN  THE
APPEARANCE  OF  THE GAPS.   YOU MAY WANT TO TRY THIS SEVERAL TIMES  TO  BECOME
COMFORTABLE WITH LOCATING GAPS ON A GIVEN TRACK.
     NOW READ IN A HALF TRACK (.5 ON THE END).   SCAN MEMORY TO LACATE SOME OF
THE GAPS.  SINCE SYSTEM MASTER DISKS DO NOT USE HALF-TRACKS, THE DATA WHICH WE
SEE HERE IS REALLY 'CROSS-TALK'.  IN OTHER WORDS, DATA WAS WRITTEN ON THE FULL
TRACK,  BUT  THE  MAGNETIC PATTERN SPREAD OUT A BIT,  AND SO WE SEE SOME  DATA
HERE.   THE TELL-TALE SIGN OF THIS PHENOMENA IS THAT THE GAPS WILL NOT BE  ALL
THE  SAME.   THAT IS,  THEY MAY HAVE ONE OR MORE VALUES IN THEM WHICH ARE  NOT
CONSISTENT.   THIS TELLS US THAT THERE IS SOME DATA ON THIS TRACK, BUT THAT IT
IS NOT VALID DATA.  TAKE A LOOK AT SOME OTHER HALF-TRACKS SO THAT YOU CAN TELL
IF YOU ARE LOOKING AT A FULL TRACK OR A HALF TRACK BY EXAMINING THE GAPS.
     THE NEXT ITEM WHICH YOU NEED TO BE ABLE TO IDENTIFY IS A BLANK TRACK.  TO
DO THIS, INSERT A BLANK (NON-INITIALIZED) DISK INTO DRIVE ONE.  READ ANY TRACK
ON  THIS  DISK AND SCAN THROUGH THE MEMORY ADDRESSES.   THERE WILL BE NO  GAPS
FOUND,  AND  MANY OF THE BYTES SEEN ON A TRACK LIKE THIS WILL END IN  0  (I.E.
$A0,$B0,$E0),  WHICH ARE NOT LEGAL DISK BYTES.  THIS MEANS THAT THE CONTROLLER
CAN FIND NO VALID DATA ON THE TRACK.  SOME DISKS HAVE PORTIONS OF TRACKS WHICH
ARE NOT USED,  SO YOU SHOULD ALWAYS BE SURE TO EXAMINE AT LEAST 24 SCREENFULLS
OF INFORMATION TO MAKE SURE THAT THERE IS NO DATA AT ANY POINT ON THE TRACK.
     OUR  NEXT  TOOL FOR FINDING DATA IS THE FACT THAT VALID DATA MUST  BE  AT
LEAST 1 TRACK APART.   IN OTHER WORDS,  IF YOU LOCATE DATA ON TRACK 3.5,  THEN
TRACK  4  CANNOT HAVE DATA AND THE NEXT PLACE WHERE DATA CAN BE IS TRACK  4.5.
THIS IS VERY HELPFUL FOR FINDING TRACKS WITH DATA.

NOTE: IF  YOU LOCATE DATA ON A GIVEN TRACK,  IT IS A GOOD IDEA TO LOOK AT  THE
     TRACKS  ONE HALF TRACK TO EITHER SIDE,  TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY LOOK  LESS
     VALID THAN THE ONE THAT YOU HAVE SELECTED AS THE REAL ONE.

     WELL,  NOW THAT WE KNOW HOW TO LOACATE DATA ON A TRACK,  WE CAN BEGIN  AT
TRACK 0 AND STEP TOWARDS TRACK 22, CHECKING EACH TRACK TO SEE IF IT APPEARS TO
HAVE DATA ON IT.   MOST DISKS HAVE A PATTERN TO THE POSITION OF THE DATA,  AND
IF  YOU CAN FIGURE IT OUT,  YOU MAY BE ABLE TO JUST CHECK A FEW TRACKS TO MAKE
SURE,  AND THEN GO ON TO STEP 2.  OTHERWISE THE DATA MUST BE LOCATED ONE TRACK
AT A TIME.
     MOST  DISKS USE THE STANDARD TRACKS (1,2,3,...,22),  BUT THERE  ARE  SOME
WHICH  USE HALF-TRACKS AND SOME WHICH USE ALL THE WAY OUT TO TRACK 23  (WHICH,
BY  THE WAY CANNOT BE READ ON ALL DRIVES SINCE NO DRIVES WERE EVER DESIGNED TO
GO OUT THAT FAR).
     WHEN ALL TRACKS WHICH CONTAIN SOME TYPE OF DATA ARE LOCATED,  WE CAN MOVE
ON TO STEP 2.

STEP 2:
     NOW  WE  MUST  TELL NIBBLES AWAY ][ HOW TO READ THE  INFORMATION  ON  THE
TRACKS WHICH WE HAVE FOUND TO CONTAIN VALID DATA.   THIS IS DONE BY GOING BACK
TO  EACH  OF THESE TRACKS WITH THE TBE AND FINDING THE ADDRESS MARK  FOR  EACH
ONE.   THE ADDRESS MARK WILL BE THE FIRST 3 BYTES FOLLOWING THE GAP.   TO  SEE
THIS IN OPERATION, TAKE A LOOK AT A TRACK FROM YOUR SYSTEM MASTER DISK.  AFTER
EACH  GAP YOU WILL SEE EITHER 'D5 AA 96' FOR A DOS 3.3 MASTER DISK,  OR 'D5 AA
B5' FOR A DOS 3.2 DISK.   THESE VALUES SHOULD BE NOTED DOWN ALONGSIDE OF  EACH
TRACK NUMBER WHICH CONTAINS DATA.  MANY TIMES THERE WILL BE ONLY ONE, OR MAYBE
2 PATTERNS FOR ALL TRACKS.
     AFTER  THIS,  WE  ARE  READY TO BACK-UP THESE TRACKS.   THIS IS  DONE  BY
EXITING THE TBE (USE 'Q') AND THEN SELECTING 'M' FOR THE MODIFIERS MENU.  THEN
SELECT 'B' FOR BACKUP MODIFIER.   WHEN ASKED 'USE ADDRESS MARK' ANSWER 'Y' AND
THEN TYPE IN THE ADDRESS MARK WHICH YOU NOTED DOWN FOR THE RANGE OF TRACKS  TO
BE  BACKED-UP.   SIMPLY  PRESS  RETURN TO THE REST OF THE QUESTIONS  AND  THEN
RETURN TO THE MAIN MENU.   SELECT 'N' TO ENTER NIBBLES AWAY ][, AND ANSWER 'Y'
TO THE QUESTION 'CHANGE DEFAULT OPTIONS'.  USE THE <RETURN> KEY TO MOVE TO THE
'START TRACK' PROMPT,  AND THEN ENTER THE FIRST TRACK TO BE BACKED-UP.   PRESS
RETURN  AND  THEN  TYPE IN THE LAST TRACK TO BE  BACKED-UP  WITH  THE  CURRENT
ADDRESS  MARKER SETTING.   IF THE TRACKS IN THE SPECIFIED RANGE ARE NOT SPACED
AT  1  TRACK INTERVALS,  ENTER THE INTERVAL AT THE 'TRACK  INCREMENT'  PROMPT.
PRESS RETURN FOR THE FOLLOWING QUESTIONS AND BEGIN THE BACKUP AFTER  INSERTING
THE DISKS WHEN PROMPTED.   WHEN YOU RETURN TO THE MAIN MENU,  REPEAT THE ABOVE
PROCEDURE  FOR EACH RANGE OF TRACKS WHICH CONTAINS A DIFFERENT ADDRESS MARKER.
     NOW COMES THE MOMENT OF TRUTH!  TRY TO BOOT UP THE BACKED-UP DISK (IF THE
ORIGINAL  HAD A WRITE-PROTECT TAB,  THE BACK-UP SHOULD TOO!).   IF THE  BACKUP
BOOTS, THEN ALL WENT SUCCESFULLY.

STEP 3:
     IF THE BACK-UP DID NOT WORK PROPERLY THEN THERE ARE A FEW THINGS TO  LOOK
FOR.

1....DID  ALL  OF THE TRACKS WHICH SHOULD HAVE BACKED-UP DO SO?   THIS CAN  BE
     SEEN  WHILE THE BACK-UP TAKES PLACE AS A 'Y' OR AN 'N' UNDER THAT  TRACKS
     STATUS LOCATION.   IF SOME DID NOT,  THEN THE ADDRESS MARKER WAS PROBABLY
     NOT DETERMINED PROPERLY.   IF THIS IS THE CASE,  THEN GO BACK TO THE  TBE
     AND TRY THOSE TRACKS AGAIN.
2....IF EVERYTHING SEEMED TO GO WELL,  BUT THE BACKUP REFUSES TO WORK (YOU MAY
     WANT  TO TRY THE PROCEDURE AGAIN,  MAYBE WITH THE SOURCE AND  DESTINATION
     DRIVES  REVERSED,  TO  MAKE SURE IT WAS NOT A POWER GLITCH OR OTHER  SUCH
     OCCURANCE  WHICH MESSED THINGS UP) THE NEXT STEP IS TO TRY THE  PROCEDURE
     WITH  THE  'SYNCHRONIZED COPY' OPTION SELECTED.   DISKS  WHICH  USE  THIS
     METHOD  OFTEN  MAKE VIOLENT HEAD MOVEMENTS DURING THEIR  BOOT  PROCEDURE.
     THIS CAN BE A CLUE TO THIS TYPE OF PROTECTION.

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION:
     ON  SOME DOS 3.3 DISKETTES,  THE GAPS BETWEEN THE SECTORS ARE REDUCED  IN
SIZE.   IN  SOME  CASES  THEY  CAN  BE  AS  SMALL  AS  4  OR  5  BYTES.   WHEN
NIBBLES  AWAY ][ FINDS THE BEGINNING OF A SECTION OF DATA,  IT NORMALLY ADDS 8
BYTES  OF SYNC JUST BEFORE THE DATA.   THIS WILL NORMALLY PUT SYNC BYTES  INTO
THE  GAP BEFORE THE DATA,  WHERE IT SHOULD BE.   HOWEVER,  IF A DISK HAS  VERY
SMALL GAPS,  THEN THE ADDED SYNC CAN OVERWRITE THE END OF THE PREVIOUS SECTOR.
THE PARAMETER FIX AMNT CONTROLS THE NUMBER OF SYNC BYTES WHICH ARE  ADDED,  SO
THIS  VALUE  CAN BE REDUCED TO PREVENT ANY DATA FROM BEING  OVERWRITTEN.   THE
VALUE THAT NIBBLES AWAY ][ USES FOR THE SYNC WHICH IT PUTS IN IS CONTAINED  IN
THE  PARAMETER  FIX VALU.   NORMALLY THIS IS A $7F,  BUT IT CAN BE SET TO  ANY
DESIRED VALUE.
    IT  SHOULD BE NOTED THAT NIBBLES AWAY ][ REGARDS ANY DATA BYTE  WHICH  HAS
ITS HIGH BIT CLEARED TO BE A SYNC BYTE.   SO THE $7F WHICH IS NORMALLY IN THIS
PARAMETER MEANS THAT A SYNC $FF IS TO BE ADDED.  IF THE 'OVERIDE STANDARDIZER'
OPTION  IS  SELECTED,  THEN NIBBLES AWAY ][ WILL NOT ADD ANY  BYTES,  IT  WILL
SIMPLY  CONVERT THE DATA WHICH IS PRESENT BEFORE A SECTOR INTO  SYNC,  WITHOUT
CHANGING ITS VALUE.   THIS TECHNIQUE CAN ALSO BE USED FOR DISKS WHOSE GAPS ARE
VERY SMALL.

     ANOTHER  ITEM TO WATCH FOR IS DISKS WHOSE TRACKS APPEAR TO BE VERY  LONG.
SOME DISK PROTECTION SCHEMES PUT GARBAGE ON A PORTION OF THE TRACK.  WHEN THIS
GARBAGE  IS  READ BACK,  MORE BYTES ARE READ IN THAN WERE WRITTEN  OUT.   THIS
CAUSES  THE TRACK TO BE LONGER THAN NORMAL,  AND IN SOME CASES IT  BECOMES  SO
LONG  THAT  THE  DEFAULT PARAMETERS FOR NIBBLES AWAY ][ CANNOT FIND  THE  DATA
PROPERLY.   THE  PARAMETERS  DATA  MIN AND DATA MAX CONTROL  THE  MINUMUM  AND
MAXIMUM TRACK LENGTHS (IN INCREMENTS OF 256 BYTES) WHICH NIBBLES AWAY ][  WILL
ACCOMODATE.   THE  NORMAL VALUE OF DATA MAX IS $1D,  BUT THIS CAN BE SET TO  A
HIGHER VALUE,  SUCH AS $25,  IF A TRACK APPEARS TO BE VERY LONG.   EVEN THOUGH
THE  TRACK  MAY  READ IN AS A LARGE NUMBER OF BYTES,  MANY OF  THESE  WILL  BE
REMOVED BY THE NIBBLE FILTER,  SINCE THEY ARE GARBAGE BYTES.  THIS WILL ASSURE
THAT  THE  AMOUNT OF DATA WRITTEN BACK OUT WILL NOT BE TO LARGE TO FIT ON  THE
DESTINATION TRACK.

     WHEN NIBBLES AWAY ][ FINDS A SECTOR OF DATA, IT LOOKS FORWARD IN THE DATA
TO FIND A SECOND OCCURANCE OF THE SAME PATTERN.   THIS INSURES THAT THE SECTOR
HAS  BEEN READ IN AND LOCATED CORRECTLY.   ON MANY DISKS,  THERE IS A  PRIMARY
SECTION  OF  DATA,  CALLED THE ADDRESS FIELD,  AND THE THE ACTUAL  DATA  FIELD
FOLLOWS.   IN BETWEEN THESE IS A SMALL GAP,  AND MANY TIMES IT CONTAINS RANDOM
INFORMATION.   THIS MEANS THAT NIBBLES AWAY ][ SHOULD ONLY MATCH THE NUMBER OF
BYTES WHICH ARE FOUND IN THE ADDRESS FIELD, SINCE THE BYTES IN THE GAP MAY NOT
READ AS THE SAME VALUE EVERY TIME.  THE PARAMETER FIND MAX CONTROLS THE NUMBER
OF  BYTES WHICH ARE CHECKED DURING THIS PROCEDURE.   THE DEFAULT VALUE OF  $0C
WORKS  IN  MOST CASES,  BUT SOME DISKS USE A SMALLER ADDRESS FIELD  WHICH  MAY
REQUIRE  THIS  PARAMETER  TO BE SET TO A  SMALLER  VALUE.   HOWEVER,  IF  THIS
PARAMETER  IS SET TOO LOW,  THEN NIBBLES AWAY ][ MAY IDENTIFY THE MATCH FOR  A
SECTION OF DATA WHOSE FIRST FEW BYTES ARE THE SAME, BUT WHICH DIFFER LATER ON.
THEREFORE ONE SHOULD EXCERSIZE CAUTION WHEN LOWERING THIS VALUE.

         FUN STUFF FOR SYSOPS
---------------------------------------
First, you must be a sysop. 
(Obviously!) Or, you may be at a 
sysop's house (When he or she is not
around.)

Second, you must be VERY popular,
or VERY daring. Either way, your
victim will have a strong dendency
to: a) crash your board, b) hate you, 
or c) spread malicious rumors about
you, and, or your board to everyone
in the world that will listen.
 
    I am going to write about AE
fun first, and then Net-Worx. 
 
 
                AE Fun
                -- ---
 
    So you are bored, and want to
have some fun, huh?
    Go into your room, or wherever
you have your apple, and sit down.
Turn on the monitor, and lets see
if there is a leech on the line.
(-note: if you are the unlucky type,
I suggest that you give this up,
because for all you know, that sysop
of the 20meg board is on your line,
and he's going to be your victim!!)
   Now for some of these pranks, you
will need to make things before-
hand. I suggest you read this through,
and make the necessary mods. 
 
1) This one is probably my meanest
trick, and should only be used on
people like Matt Ackerett, or Little
Al.
   Your victim has to be leeching
a game off of your AE for this to
work.
   You wait until your victim is at
his last 2 blocks of memeory to go
until the transfer is done, and
you take out the disk. 
   This will ruin the >entire<
transmission. It won't piss them off
too bad if it is only 50 or so blocks,
but can you imagine:
 
Send: Matt Ackerett is a fag
290 blocks
crc=167
<289>
 
    Note- The victim has to get 290
blocks, you only let the victim get
289!
 
 
   At that point, take out the disk!
They have just waited 1/2 hour for
nothing! They can't get the last block
and have to go through the whole
thing again!! Ha ha!  
   This is very mean, especially if
they aren't phreaking, they have
been >paying< for it all!
 
             
2) If you want to see if the person
on is intelligent...simply let him
catalog your drive once, then when he
is done, take the disk out, and 
put in the disk from the other drive.
When they catalog the disk next, it 
will be different!
   This will freak them out, they will
think that they have switched to d1
somehow. The victim will then L)og the
drive, and find it still on D2. Wow!
   Hopefully they will catalog D1 
anyway, thinking that they were
originally on D1 and it switched.
Now comes the fun. 
   Put the right disk back in D2, 
and put the disk that used to be in D2
into D1, so they will get the same 
catalog.
   Now they are confused. Now
they will catalog D2, and find the
normal stuff. Hopefull they will
read something, now take the disk
out while they are typing in the name,
and slip the other disk in. It
will say 'file not found.'
   Good. Now they will catalog it,
and look! The wares have changed!
Now something is wrong here! They
will say:
 
hey! stop it!
 
   Oh no! They are on to your scheme!
But, 1 last joke! Get a copy-protected
type disk, one that you <gasp> bought.
They won't be able to catalog this
at all! Ha!
   If they get mad, they might
say something like:
 
        Hey! Stop it!
   
   But will you listen? nnnoooooo!
Take the disk out, and slip something
totally new, preferably the disk that
has "sneakers" or some ancient wares.
Maybe they will think these are the
latest! Watch them post!:
 
      Hey! I just got some new 
      Warez! Do you want to trade??
 
hah hah!
 
  Satisfied, you may put the normal
disks back in and walk off to see
some football game.
 
3) Lock out the space-bar. This will
make it so that they can't type a
<space>. Then, they can't read
anything that requires a space. 
Most likely the victim will think that
there is something wrong with >his< 
computer. Thusly sending him/her/it
into a 1/2 hour scan of their install
program to see what is wrong.
 
4) Change the commands...such as:
 
d)irectory= c)irectory
-           -
 
   They will have to hack at the 
commands! This won't be too funny,
because they won't do anything stupid
like posting:
 
     hey your commands are screwed!
  
   Most likely they wont find the 
command for 'copy'.
 
 
5) lock out the "ctrl-c". This will
piss them off when the victim just
can't exit from posting. Ha!
 
6) Change the ring count, most, or
almost >all< AE lines are set to 
pick up after just 1 ring. Change it
to...say...5 rings, and only tell your
friends that it is at 5 rings. When
they call, they will only wait for 
about 2 rings, and hang up thinking
that the line is down. Only the people
you like will get on, because they 
will be the only ones to wait 5 rings.
Mean huh?
 
7) When someone is posting, or c)opy-
ing a message, pick up the voice line,
and blow into the reciever. This will
put all of these weird characters onto
the screen. He will save a gay looking
message, that will make it look like
the victim can't type!! 
 
 
               Net Works
               --- -----
 
   I don't have as many fun tricks
with net-worx as I do with AE, but
here are a couple of my favorites...
 
1) In the program, make a bug, like
"ctrl-k" that when pushed (like ctrl-t
for chat) it will dump you into basic.
take out the disks, and put in like 
the "bare-bones" net-worx disk and let
them have fun reading fake messages,
mail, and passwords. Ooooh! They will
think:
 
oh yay! I have everyone's pass!
 
Now, see if he/she will init the 
disks, if they do, you know what type
of user it is. If they are nice,
and 'hang' the line for you so that
no one wil be able to get on after,
or they try to beep you, then give 
them a level raise.
 
2) Be a tyrant. Juggle their levels
while they are on. Like break into
chat, change their level, and watch
them get all mad. 
 
3) Break into chat, and just walk off,
leaving a frustrated user sitting
there.
 
4) break into chat, and change the
time. In other words, leave them
with -10 minutes, instead of 35 or
so.
 
5) when they log off, and they get
that stupid message about:
 
            Thank you for
              calling
 
and all of that, press 'ctrl-c' a
few times, and they will be brought
back. Wow! What happened? Let them
try to log off a few times nd keep
pressing ctrl-c. Finally they should
just press 'reset'. He he!
 
 
    I hope you have enjoyed these
little pranks. Your users will hate
you if you do this too often, unless
they are like Matt Ackeret or Little
Al. Then it doesn't matter much.
    Remember! I hold no responsibilty
for people wanting to crash your 
system because they are so pissed
at you!

        DOS Notes & Pointers..

Suggested reading: Beneath Apple DOS
                   The DOS Manual

Needed equipment: Apple, Drive
                  IQ > 60

  I will start this article by giving
you an overview of what is in DOS and
what it does. First of all there is
the RWTS. This allows you to read or
write a sector at a time. All oper-
ations are done either directly or
indirectly through this. Starting at
$B600 and ending at $BFFF RWTS takes
up about 2.5K. Next is the File
Manager. This goes from $AAC9 to $B5FF
This is a bunch of subroutines which
execute your commands from basic.
Then there are the main DOS routines.
These interpret your commands and tell
the file manager what to do, which in
turn uses the RWTS to do them. These
routines go from $9D00 to $AAC8.
When you have MAXFILES set to 3, DOS
reserves memory from $9600 to $9CFF.
Setting MAXFILES higher will take up
more memory, lower than $9600.
There is another part of DOS, which
resides in the latter part of page 3
or from $3D0 to $3FF. This is called
the Dos Vector Table. I will go into
detail on that later.

 Well now, lets say you put a disk in
the drive and turned your computer on.
Then you loaded a file, edited it and
saved it. Why don't we take a look and
see exactly what is happening.

 When you turn your computer on (if
you have autostart) the code on your
drive controller prom takes over.
This loads in a routine at $800.
This is called Boot 0. Then it jumps
to $801 and executes that code (boot
1). That code loads in sectors 1
through 9 which in turn loads in the
rest of DOS. Then it looks to see if
you have a HELLO program and jumps
to it. The first thing it does when
loading in a program, in this case
the HELLO program, is look at the
catalog track. Then after it finds
the file and the track and sector it
starts on, it reads in the first
sector. The first sector of a program
is called the Track Sector List or
TSL. This is a listing of all tracks
and sectors that have data for that
program. DOS reads this into memory
and then starts loading the program
in. But where does it know where to
load the program in and how does it
know what file type it is?
The file type was back on the catalog,
more (lots more) on that later...
On the first sector of data, not the
TSL, in the first two bytes is the
address to start loading in at. These
bytes as usual are in reverse order.
Well, now you know a little of how
DOS works. Lets go into more detail.

 Here is where I will probably lose
you. If it gets confusing hang on.
 Now we will look at track $11, which
is the catalog track. The VTOC or
Volume Table Of Contents is stored
at track $11, sector $00. This tells
DOS such things as: what sectors are
free, volume #, DOS version, first
link to catalog sector...
Bytes $01 & $02 of the VTOC tells us
 where to find the
first catalog sector. This usually is
track $11, sector $0F. Byte $02 is
the DOS version. Either a "1", "2",
"3", for DOS 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, consec-
utively. Byte $07 is the volume #
usually $FE (254). The next thing of
interest is the Bit Map. Starting at
byte $38 you will see "FFFF0000".
For now, ignore the last two bytes.
The "FFFF" is a binary representation
of what sectors are free on a certain
track. In the two bytes there are
16 bits. Makes sense doesn't it, 16
bits and 16 sectors. If the bit is
set or a "1" then that sector is free.
If it is a "0" then it's used.
Now lets look at the catalog link.
On track $11, sector $0F, byte $01,
are two bytes that tell what track
and sector to find the first catalog
sector. This is almost always track 11
sector $0F. On track $11, sector $0F,
bytes 1 and 2, is a pointer to the
next sector, track $11, sector $0E.
The links continue until sector $01
where you will see zero's in those
bytes. I have been asked many times
how to get more than 105 files onto
a disk. If you edit the second and
third bytes on track $11, sector $01
to "100F", you will be able to use
track $10, sector $0F for a catalog
sector. You can continue on track
10 sector F and make a link to the
next sector and so on. Be sure to
mark it on the bit map or it will
get wiped out when DOS has to write
there. Well, we have covered most
of the VTOC, lets look at how the
catalog sectors are formatted.

 Starting at byte $0B on any catalog
sector, is the entry for a file.
The first two bytes after that, tells
what track and sector the program
starts on. Then is the file type (more
on that later). Next comes the file
name, up to 30 characters. The last
byte before the next entry tells us
how many sectors the file takes.
This usually never goes over 255
sectors, however text files can take
more than 255 sectors. Now we can
look at the file type. We have to look
at this at the binary level. If the
first bit is set, it is a text file.
If the second is set, it's Integer.
Third is applesoft, fourth is binary.
If the eigth or MSB is set, the file
is locked. It's really quite simple.
$00 means a text file. $80 means a
locked text file. If it is a $84,
we have a locked binary file.

 Now for the complicated stuff, how
DOS writes sectors, INITs a disk,
the "6 & 2" split. Lets say you put a
blank disk in the drive, initialized
it, and saved a file onto it. Lets see
what happens. First off, at $A54F is
the INIT routine. If you did A54FG
from monitor, it would INIT your disk
without a hello program. This lets
your disk boot faster because it does
not have to load in that file.
Ok. So you type in "INIT HELLO". DOS
takes over and starts formatting your
disk starting with track 0 and ending
with track $23. Then it writes the
catalog track and VTOC. Last it writes
in DOS. Lets take a close look at a
disk at the track level. First off we
have what is called a GAP. This is made
up of "FF"'s. Then we have the prolouge
marks, ye olde "D5 AA 96". After that
comes the volume, track, sector, check-
sum, epilouge "DE AA EB". Then comes a
smaller GAP with a different prolouge
"D5 AA AD". Then $342 bytes of user
data. Oops! $342 bytes of user data?
I thought there were only $FF or 255
bytes per sector! (more on this later).
Then we have the checksum. And last
we have the epilouge "DE AA EB".
There are certain bytes that DOS
doesn't write as data. These bytes are
used in proulouge and epilouge marks.
DOS looks for these when trying to find
a sector. Now for the "6 & 2" split.
The hardware on the apple doesn't allow
for more than $3F different bytes to
be written. That's why they used the
"5 & 3" split on 3.2 disks. What that
means is that from one byte, five bits
are taken out and form one byte. The
other three bits form one byte also.
The six and two split is the same thing
as the five and three but allows for
more combinations.

 Now for a little on copy protection.
Back in the good 'ol days we could just
demuffin everything. All they had was
a modified DOS or changed address marks
etc. After that they got a little
smarter and some wrote their own DOS
or used a modified RWTS. But nothing
stops us pirates, all you had to do
is read in data through their RWTS and
write it back out standard. Then they
got dirty, using the text page and the
input buffer for data or code. They
even used the stack (page 1) for code.
To get around this, NMI card like
crackshot and cracking chips were made.
these dumped all memory to disk allow-
ing the text page and the input buffer
to be undisturbed. The newest thing
seems to be SPIRAL TRACKING. The first
game I saw this on was Maze Craze.
Cracking it was quite easy though. All
you had to do is cut out one part of
disk access (at $855) that wasn't even
needed. But who knows what we will be
up against in the future.

 I suggest you read "Beneath Apple DOS"
 and look at the DOS manual supplied
with your Apple. This is for beginners
or people who are too lazy to read
a book...

 I would appreciate lots of questions,
I may not have made myself too clear
or you may want to know more about
a certain area. Just leave me e-mail.

   The Freeze

       D O S     T R I C K S        
 
 TRY THIS TO SEE ANY DOS, REMOVE THE
REAR MOST SET OF RAM CHIPS FROM YOUR
APPLE (THE ONES NEAR THE I/O SLOTS).
THEN INIT A DISK, REPLACE THE RAM AND
BOOT UP UNDER THE PROGRAM YOU WISH TO
DEPROTECT. THEN FORCE A REBOOT WITH THE
DISK YOU INITED IN DRIVE 1. THE DOS 
FROM THE PROTECTED DISK WILL (IN MOST
CASES) STILL BE IN THE RAM UP TOP....
 
THIS NEW DOS IS A SLAVE AT 32 K AND
THE OLD (AND PROTECTED DOS) IS STILL
AT 48 K. THIS WILL WORK ON ABOUT 50%
OF THE PROGRAMS.  ENJOY
 

YOU CAN ALSO REMOVE THE TOP 32K AND
GET TWICE AS MUCH.

=======================================
CHECKSUM TRICK

A  VERY  HANDY TECHNIQUE FOR  TAKING  A
LOOK AT THE DATA ON A PROTECTED DISK IS
TO  DISABLE  THE CHECKSUM IN THE  RWTS.
THE  FORMATS  OF MANY  PROTECTED  DISKS
VARY ONLY IN THIS CHECKSUM,  SO TURNING
IT   OFF  SHOULD  ALLOW  ANY   STANDARD
TRACK/SECTOR  UTILITY  TO LOOK  AT  THE
DISK!  TO DO THIS, BOOT UP THE DOS THAT
YOU WISH TO USE, AND ENTER THE MONITOR.
THEN  ENTER   B942:18 FOR  DOS  3.3  OR
B963:18  FOR DOS 3.2.   THIS CHANGES  A
SET  CARRY INSTRUCTION TO A CLEAR CARRY
INSTRUCTION.  NOW RETURN TO DOS AND RUN
YOUR  EDITOR.   IF  THE  DISK  YOU  ARE
LOOKING  AT  IS  PROTECTED  WITH   THIS
SYSTEM,  YOU  SHOULD BE ABLE TO READ IT
NOW. TO MAKE  THIS CHANGE TO A DOS ON A
DISK, THIS DATA IS CONTAINED IN TRACK 0
SECTOR  3,  AT EITHER BYTE $42 OR  BYTE
$63, FOR DOS 3.3 OR 3.2, RESPECTIVELY.
GOOD LUCK.......
                     RANDY

=======================================

TO AVOID RE-LOADING THE LANGUAGE CARD
ON BOOTUP ( A MAJOR IRRITATION )
CHANGE THE FOLLOWING :
 
 
IN A 48K SYSTEM, CHANGE $BFCC TO 00 AND
$BFCF TO 00 : THIS WILL PREVENT THE 
LANGUAGE CARD FROM BEING WRITTEN TO.
(INITIALIZE A DISKETTE WITH THIS DO
 TO MAKE IT BOOT UP IN THIS FASHION)
 
(IF YOU LOOK AT THE CODE, YOU CAN MAKE 
THE SAME MODS IN A COPY OF A SYST
MASTER ON THE DISK ITSELF, SO A MASTER
CREATE WILL PUT THIS DOS ON A DISKETTE.
CHANGE THE CODE THAT SAYS LDA C081 WITH
LDA C000 -- THAT SSHOULD WORK FINE.
 
=======================================

GET INTO MONITOR FROM A NORMAL DISK.
TYPE:   400<A800.ABFFM
 
POOF THERE YOU HAVE ALL THE DOS COMANDS
NOTICE THAT ALL THE LETTERS IN THE
COMAND ARE FLASHING BUT THE LAST ONE
THAT IS TO TELL YOU WHERE THE COMAND
ENDS. NOW NOTICE WHERE THE INIT,LOAD,
BLOAD,SAVE,BSAVE,CATALOG, ETC...
THEN BOOT SOMETHING LIKE BRAIN SURGEON
OR SOMETHING THAT HAS SOMETHING LIKE
A NORMAL FORMAT THEN TYPE THAT LINE
AND THEN YOU CAN SEE IF THEY CHANGED
ANY OF THE COMANDS!

COSMOS PROVIDES A LANGUAGE BY MEAN OF 
WHICH A USER CAN COMMUNICATE WITH THE 
SYSTEM. THE LANGUAGE INCLUDES VARIOUS
PREFIXES AS WELL AS INPUT FORMATS AND

MSG LEFT BY: SALLY RIDE
DATE POSTED: 

INPUT VALUES. PREFIXES ARE ABBREVIATION
WHICH REPRESENT SPECIFIC DATA CATAGORIE
TO THE SYSTEM WHEN INPUT BY THE USER. 
AN EXAMPLE OF A PREFIX IS "TN"WHICH 
MEANS "TELEPHONE NUMBER". AN INPUT 
FORMAT DETERMINES THE NUMBER OF CHARAC-
TERS FOLLOWING A PREFIX AS WELL AS THE
PATTERN IN WHICH THESE MUST BE ENTERED.
FOR EXAMPLE, "TN XXX-XXXX" MEANS THAT 
THE PREFIX "TN" MUST BE FOLLOWED BY 
SEVEN CHARACTERS IN THE FORMAT SHOWN.
 
INPUT VALUES ARE THE ALLOWABLE DATA
ENTERED FOR EACH PREFIX IN THE CORRECT
INPUT FORMAT. AS MENTIONED IN THE 
PREVIOUS PARAGRAPH THE INPUT FORMAT
FOR THE PREFIX "TN" IS "TN XXX-XXXX"
THE FIRST THREE CHARACTERS (XXX) MUST
BE ALPHANUMERIC; THE LAST FOUR (XXXX)
MUST BE NUMERIC. SO, COSMOS WOULD CON-
SIDER AN INPUT OF "TN 935-2481" AS
VALID INPUT. BUT YOU *MUST* USE THE
CORRECT WIRE CENTER FOR THE (XXX) IN 
QUESTION. IN HACKING COSMOS PART 2
LEX WILL HAVE A LIST OF THE MOST 
COMMONLY USED PREFIXES, FORMATS AND
PREFIX CODE VALUES WHICH ENABLE YOU

             STEP BY STEP GUIDE TO BACKING-UP DISKS
                              WITH
                         NIBBLES AWAY ][

     THERE ARE THREE BASIC STEPS TO BACKUP A DISKETTE:

1. LOCATE THE TRACKS WHICH CONTAIN DATA.
2. FIND THE ADDRESS MARKER FOR THE SECTORS THERE.
3. FIGURE OUT ANY ADDITIONAL PROTECTION.

(HINT: #3 IS THE HARD ONE!)

     FOR  MOST  OF  THE PROCEDURES BELOW,  A BASIC WORKING  KNOWLEDGE  OF  THE
TRACK/BIT EDITOR (TBE) IS REQUIRED.   FOR THOSE WHO ARE NOT FAMILIAR WITH  THE
TBE,  AN OVERALL DESCRIPTION AND SOME EXAMPLES ARE GIVEN BELOW.   THE EXAMPLES
ARE  EASIER TO UNDERSTAND IF THEY ARE PERFORMED AS YOU READ THIS,  SO YOU  MAY
WANT TO BOOT UP NIBBLES AWAY ][ AND TRY THEM OUT TO GET A BETTER UNDERSTANDING
OF WHAT IS GOING ON.

     ENTER  THE  TBE  BY SELECTING OPTION 'T' FROM THE  MAIN  MENU.   A  LARGE
SECTION  OF  NUMBERS WILL APPEAR ON THE SCREEN,  WITH TWO DASHED LINES AT  THE
TOP.   THE  INFORMATION IN BETWEEN THESE LINES IS THE STATUS  INFORMATION  AND
INFORMS YOU OF SUCH THINGS AS CURSOR POSITION,  TRACK NUMBER,  AND IS ALSO THE
LOCATION  WHERE VARIOUS PROMPTS APPEAR FOR CERTAIN FUNCTIONS.   THE NUMBERS AT
THE  BOTTOM  ARE SEPARATED INTO TWO SECTIONS.   ON THE LEFT ARE  THE  STARTING
MEMORY  ADDRESS'S FOR EACH LINE TO THE RIGHT.   MOVE THE CURSOR  AROUND  USING
I,J,K OR M, AND WATCH THE ADDR INDICATOR IN THE STATUS LINE.  IT WILL TELL YOU
EXACTLY WHAT MEMORY ADDRESS THE VALUE UNDER THE CURSOR REPRESENTS.   THE ARROW
KEYS  CHANGE THE AREA OF MEMORY WHICH YOU CAN SEE.   THEY SHIFT YOUR VIEW  256
BYTES FORWARD OR BACKWARD AT A TIME.   THE ONLY REALLY IMPORTANT THING TO KNOW
FOR  THIS DISCUSSION IS HOW TO USE THE ARROW KEYS TO MOVE THE VIEWING 'WINDOW'
AROUND IN MEMORY.
     THE  ';'  (UNSHIFTED '+') AND THE '-' KEYS INCREMENT  AND  DECREMENT  THE
TRACK  NUMBER IN THE STATUS LINE.   PRESSING 'R' WILL CAUSE DRIVE ONE TO  READ
THE  DATA FROM THE TRACK INDICATED IN THE STATUS LINE INTO MEMORY.   THE BYTES
ON THE SCREEN WILL CHANGE,  SINCE DIFFERENT DATA HAS BEEN READ  IN.   PRESSING
THE  'R'  KEY  MULTIPLE TIMES WILL RESULT IN DIFFERENT DATA  BEING  DISPLAYED.
THIS IS BECAUSE NIBBLES AWAY ][ STARTS READING AT WHATEVER POINT HAPPENS TO BE
UNDER THE HEAD WHEN THE DRIVE IS TURNED ON,  WHICH IS RANDOM, HENCE THE CHANGE
IN  THE  DISPLAYED DATA (THE DATA IS NOT ACTUALLY DIFFERENT,  IT IS  JUST  NOT
LOADED AT THE SAME MEMORY LOCATION AS IT WAS PREVIOUSLY).

STEP 1:
     TO  DO  THIS WE MUST LOCATE ALL OF THE TRACKS ON THE DISK  WHICH  CONTAIN
DATA.   TO DO THIS WE SHOULD HAVE THE TRACK POINTER SET TO TRACK 00.  PRESSING
'R'  WILL READ IN THE TRACK AND SHOW IT ON THE SCREEN.   THE ARROW KEYS SHOULD
BE  USED  TO MOVE THE VIEWING 'WINDOW' TO START AT $2000.   NOW WE  WILL  MOVE
FORWARD  AND TRY TO DETERMINE IF THIS TRACK CONTAINS  VALID  DATA.   ACTUALLY,
TRACK 00 MUST CONTAIN SOME DATA IN ORDER FOR THE DISK TO BOOT,  BUT WE WILL BE
USING THIS PROCEDURE ON OTHER TRACKS WHICH DO NOT NECESSARILY CONTAIN DATA.
     THE  MAIN  THING  WHICH WILL IDENTIFY A TRACK AS CONTAINING DATA  IS  THE
PRESENCE OF GAPS.   GAPS ARE SECTIONS OF THE SAME BYTE REPEATED SEVERAL TIMES.
NORMALLY THEY ARE MADE UP OF $FF'S AND ARE 6-20 IN LENGTH.   TO SEE WHAT THESE
LOOK  LIKE,  INSERT YOUR SYSTEM MASTER DISK AND READ IN TRACK 00 AS  DESCRIBED
ABOVE.   MOVING  THROUGH  THE BUFFER WITH THE ARROW KEYS WILL REVEAL  A  LARGE
VARIETY  OF VALUES.   SPACED OUT AMONG THESE SHOULD BE SECTIONS OF FF'S  WHICH
CONTAIN ABOUT 6-20 IN A ROW,  DEPENDING ON THE EXACT DISK.   NORMALLY DOS  3.2
DISKS HAVE LARGER GAPS THAN DOS 3.3 DISKS.  THERE SHOULD BE MANY OCCURANCES OF
THE  GAPS,  SPACED OUT SO THAT YOU SEE ONE ABOUT EVERY OTHER TIME THAT YOU USE
THE ARROW KEYS TO MOVE FORWARD OR BACKWARD.

NOTE:YOU  MAY SEE A SECOND,  SMALLER (2-5 $FF'S),  GAP FOLLOWING A LARGE  GAP,
     WITH  A SMALL SECTION OF DATA IN BETWEEN.   THIS IS CALLED THE  SECONDARY
     GAP.   WHEN  REFERING TO A GAP HERE,  WE WILL ALWAYS BE TALKING ABOUT THE
     PRIMARY GAP, NOT THE SECONDARY ONE.

     NOW TRY LOOKING AT OTHER TRACKS ON THE DISK.  FIRST LOOK ONLY AT THE FULL
TRACKS  (NO .5 ON THE END).   ALL OF THEM WILL BE SIMILAR TO TRACK 00  IN  THE
APPEARANCE  OF  THE GAPS.   YOU MAY WANT TO TRY THIS SEVERAL TIMES  TO  BECOME
COMFORTABLE WITH LOCATING GAPS ON A GIVEN TRACK.
     NOW READ IN A HALF TRACK (.5 ON THE END).   SCAN MEMORY TO LACATE SOME OF
THE GAPS.  SINCE SYSTEM MASTER DISKS DO NOT USE HALF-TRACKS, THE DATA WHICH WE
SEE HERE IS REALLY 'CROSS-TALK'.  IN OTHER WORDS, DATA WAS WRITTEN ON THE FULL
TRACK,  BUT  THE  MAGNETIC PATTERN SPREAD OUT A BIT,  AND SO WE SEE SOME  DATA
HERE.   THE TELL-TALE SIGN OF THIS PHENOMENA IS THAT THE GAPS WILL NOT BE  ALL
THE  SAME.   THAT IS,  THEY MAY HAVE ONE OR MORE VALUES IN THEM WHICH ARE  NOT
CONSISTENT.   THIS TELLS US THAT THERE IS SOME DATA ON THIS TRACK, BUT THAT IT
IS NOT VALID DATA.  TAKE A LOOK AT SOME OTHER HALF-TRACKS SO THAT YOU CAN TELL
IF YOU ARE LOOKING AT A FULL TRACK OR A HALF TRACK BY EXAMINING THE GAPS.
     THE NEXT ITEM WHICH YOU NEED TO BE ABLE TO IDENTIFY IS A BLANK TRACK.  TO
DO THIS, INSERT A BLANK (NON-INITIALIZED) DISK INTO DRIVE ONE.  READ ANY TRACK
ON  THIS  DISK AND SCAN THROUGH THE MEMORY ADDRESSES.   THERE WILL BE NO  GAPS
FOUND,  AND  MANY OF THE BYTES SEEN ON A TRACK LIKE THIS WILL END IN  0  (I.E.
$A0,$B0,$E0),  WHICH ARE NOT LEGAL DISK BYTES.  THIS MEANS THAT THE CONTROLLER
CAN FIND NO VALID DATA ON THE TRACK.  SOME DISKS HAVE PORTIONS OF TRACKS WHICH
ARE NOT USED,  SO YOU SHOULD ALWAYS BE SURE TO EXAMINE AT LEAST 24 SCREENFULLS
OF INFORMATION TO MAKE SURE THAT THERE IS NO DATA AT ANY POINT ON THE TRACK.
     OUR  NEXT  TOOL FOR FINDING DATA IS THE FACT THAT VALID DATA MUST  BE  AT
LEAST 1 TRACK APART.   IN OTHER WORDS,  IF YOU LOCATE DATA ON TRACK 3.5,  THEN
TRACK  4  CANNOT HAVE DATA AND THE NEXT PLACE WHERE DATA CAN BE IS TRACK  4.5.
THIS IS VERY HELPFUL FOR FINDING TRACKS WITH DATA.

NOTE: IF  YOU LOCATE DATA ON A GIVEN TRACK,  IT IS A GOOD IDEA TO LOOK AT  THE
     TRACKS  ONE HALF TRACK TO EITHER SIDE,  TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY LOOK  LESS
     VALID THAN THE ONE THAT YOU HAVE SELECTED AS THE REAL ONE.

     WELL,  NOW THAT WE KNOW HOW TO LOACATE DATA ON A TRACK,  WE CAN BEGIN  AT
TRACK 0 AND STEP TOWARDS TRACK 22, CHECKING EACH TRACK TO SEE IF IT APPEARS TO
HAVE DATA ON IT.   MOST DISKS HAVE A PATTERN TO THE POSITION OF THE DATA,  AND
IF  YOU CAN FIGURE IT OUT,  YOU MAY BE ABLE TO JUST CHECK A FEW TRACKS TO MAKE
SURE,  AND THEN GO ON TO STEP 2.  OTHERWISE THE DATA MUST BE LOCATED ONE TRACK
AT A TIME.
     MOST  DISKS USE THE STANDARD TRACKS (1,2,3,...,22),  BUT THERE  ARE  SOME
WHICH  USE HALF-TRACKS AND SOME WHICH USE ALL THE WAY OUT TO TRACK 23  (WHICH,
BY  THE WAY CANNOT BE READ ON ALL DRIVES SINCE NO DRIVES WERE EVER DESIGNED TO
GO OUT THAT FAR).
     WHEN ALL TRACKS WHICH CONTAIN SOME TYPE OF DATA ARE LOCATED,  WE CAN MOVE
ON TO STEP 2.

STEP 2:
     NOW  WE  MUST  TELL NIBBLES AWAY ][ HOW TO READ THE  INFORMATION  ON  THE
TRACKS WHICH WE HAVE FOUND TO CONTAIN VALID DATA.   THIS IS DONE BY GOING BACK
TO  EACH  OF THESE TRACKS WITH THE TBE AND FINDING THE ADDRESS MARK  FOR  EACH
ONE.   THE ADDRESS MARK WILL BE THE FIRST 3 BYTES FOLLOWING THE GAP.   TO  SEE
THIS IN OPERATION, TAKE A LOOK AT A TRACK FROM YOUR SYSTEM MASTER DISK.  AFTER
EACH  GAP YOU WILL SEE EITHER 'D5 AA 96' FOR A DOS 3.3 MASTER DISK,  OR 'D5 AA
B5' FOR A DOS 3.2 DISK.   THESE VALUES SHOULD BE NOTED DOWN ALONGSIDE OF  EACH
TRACK NUMBER WHICH CONTAINS DATA.  MANY TIMES THERE WILL BE ONLY ONE, OR MAYBE
2 PATTERNS FOR ALL TRACKS.
     AFTER  THIS,  WE  ARE  READY TO BACK-UP THESE TRACKS.   THIS IS  DONE  BY
EXITING THE TBE (USE 'Q') AND THEN SELECTING 'M' FOR THE MODIFIERS MENU.  THEN
SELECT 'B' FOR BACKUP MODIFIER.   WHEN ASKED 'USE ADDRESS MARK' ANSWER 'Y' AND
THEN TYPE IN THE ADDRESS MARK WHICH YOU NOTED DOWN FOR THE RANGE OF TRACKS  TO
BE  BACKED-UP.   SIMPLY  PRESS  RETURN TO THE REST OF THE QUESTIONS  AND  THEN
RETURN TO THE MAIN MENU.   SELECT 'N' TO ENTER NIBBLES AWAY ][, AND ANSWER 'Y'
TO THE QUESTION 'CHANGE DEFAULT OPTIONS'.  USE THE <RETURN> KEY TO MOVE TO THE
'START TRACK' PROMPT,  AND THEN ENTER THE FIRST TRACK TO BE BACKED-UP.   PRESS
RETURN  AND  THEN  TYPE IN THE LAST TRACK TO BE  BACKED-UP  WITH  THE  CURRENT
ADDRESS  MARKER SETTING.   IF THE TRACKS IN THE SPECIFIED RANGE ARE NOT SPACED
AT  1  TRACK INTERVALS,  ENTER THE INTERVAL AT THE 'TRACK  INCREMENT'  PROMPT.
PRESS RETURN FOR THE FOLLOWING QUESTIONS AND BEGIN THE BACKUP AFTER  INSERTING
THE DISKS WHEN PROMPTED.   WHEN YOU RETURN TO THE MAIN MENU,  REPEAT THE ABOVE
PROCEDURE  FOR EACH RANGE OF TRACKS WHICH CONTAINS A DIFFERENT ADDRESS MARKER.
     NOW COMES THE MOMENT OF TRUTH!  TRY TO BOOT UP THE BACKED-UP DISK (IF THE
ORIGINAL  HAD A WRITE-PROTECT TAB,  THE BACK-UP SHOULD TOO!).   IF THE  BACKUP
BOOTS, THEN ALL WENT SUCCESFULLY.

STEP 3:
     IF THE BACK-UP DID NOT WORK PROPERLY THEN THERE ARE A FEW THINGS TO  LOOK
FOR.

1....DID  ALL  OF THE TRACKS WHICH SHOULD HAVE BACKED-UP DO SO?   THIS CAN  BE
     SEEN  WHILE THE BACK-UP TAKES PLACE AS A 'Y' OR AN 'N' UNDER THAT  TRACKS
     STATUS LOCATION.   IF SOME DID NOT,  THEN THE ADDRESS MARKER WAS PROBABLY
     NOT DETERMINED PROPERLY.   IF THIS IS THE CASE,  THEN GO BACK TO THE  TBE
     AND TRY THOSE TRACKS AGAIN.
2....IF EVERYTHING SEEMED TO GO WELL,  BUT THE BACKUP REFUSES TO WORK (YOU MAY
     WANT  TO TRY THE PROCEDURE AGAIN,  MAYBE WITH THE SOURCE AND  DESTINATION
     DRIVES  REVERSED,  TO  MAKE SURE IT WAS NOT A POWER GLITCH OR OTHER  SUCH
     OCCURANCE  WHICH MESSED THINGS UP) THE NEXT STEP IS TO TRY THE  PROCEDURE
     WITH  THE  'SYNCHRONIZED COPY' OPTION SELECTED.   DISKS  WHICH  USE  THIS
     METHOD  OFTEN  MAKE VIOLENT HEAD MOVEMENTS DURING THEIR  BOOT  PROCEDURE.
     THIS CAN BE A CLUE TO THIS TYPE OF PROTECTION.

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION:
     ON  SOME DOS 3.3 DISKETTES,  THE GAPS BETWEEN THE SECTORS ARE REDUCED  IN
SIZE.   IN  SOME  CASES  THEY  CAN  BE  AS  SMALL  AS  4  OR  5  BYTES.   WHEN
NIBBLES  AWAY ][ FINDS THE BEGINNING OF A SECTION OF DATA,  IT NORMALLY ADDS 8
BYTES  OF SYNC JUST BEFORE THE DATA.   THIS WILL NORMALLY PUT SYNC BYTES  INTO
THE  GAP BEFORE THE DATA,  WHERE IT SHOULD BE.   HOWEVER,  IF A DISK HAS  VERY
SMALL GAPS,  THEN THE ADDED SYNC CAN OVERWRITE THE END OF THE PREVIOUS SECTOR.
THE PARAMETER FIX AMNT CONTROLS THE NUMBER OF SYNC BYTES WHICH ARE  ADDED,  SO
THIS  VALUE  CAN BE REDUCED TO PREVENT ANY DATA FROM BEING  OVERWRITTEN.   THE
VALUE THAT NIBBLES AWAY ][ USES FOR THE SYNC WHICH IT PUTS IN IS CONTAINED  IN
THE  PARAMETER  FIX VALU.   NORMALLY THIS IS A $7F,  BUT IT CAN BE SET TO  ANY
DESIRED VALUE.
    IT  SHOULD BE NOTED THAT NIBBLES AWAY ][ REGARDS ANY DATA BYTE  WHICH  HAS
ITS HIGH BIT CLEARED TO BE A SYNC BYTE.   SO THE $7F WHICH IS NORMALLY IN THIS
PARAMETER MEANS THAT A SYNC $FF IS TO BE ADDED.  IF THE 'OVERIDE STANDARDIZER'
OPTION  IS  SELECTED,  THEN NIBBLES AWAY ][ WILL NOT ADD ANY  BYTES,  IT  WILL
SIMPLY  CONVERT THE DATA WHICH IS PRESENT BEFORE A SECTOR INTO  SYNC,  WITHOUT
CHANGING ITS VALUE.   THIS TECHNIQUE CAN ALSO BE USED FOR DISKS WHOSE GAPS ARE
VERY SMALL.

     ANOTHER  ITEM TO WATCH FOR IS DISKS WHOSE TRACKS APPEAR TO BE VERY  LONG.
SOME DISK PROTECTION SCHEMES PUT GARBAGE ON A PORTION OF THE TRACK.  WHEN THIS
GARBAGE  IS  READ BACK,  MORE BYTES ARE READ IN THAN WERE WRITTEN  OUT.   THIS
CAUSES  THE TRACK TO BE LONGER THAN NORMAL,  AND IN SOME CASES IT  BECOMES  SO
LONG  THAT  THE  DEFAULT PARAMETERS FOR NIBBLES AWAY ][ CANNOT FIND  THE  DATA
PROPERLY.   THE  PARAMETERS  DATA  MIN AND DATA MAX CONTROL  THE  MINUMUM  AND
MAXIMUM TRACK LENGTHS (IN INCREMENTS OF 256 BYTES) WHICH NIBBLES AWAY ][  WILL
ACCOMODATE.   THE  NORMAL VALUE OF DATA MAX IS $1D,  BUT THIS CAN BE SET TO  A
HIGHER VALUE,  SUCH AS $25,  IF A TRACK APPEARS TO BE VERY LONG.   EVEN THOUGH
THE  TRACK  MAY  READ IN AS A LARGE NUMBER OF BYTES,  MANY OF  THESE  WILL  BE
REMOVED BY THE NIBBLE FILTER,  SINCE THEY ARE GARBAGE BYTES.  THIS WILL ASSURE
THAT  THE  AMOUNT OF DATA WRITTEN BACK OUT WILL NOT BE TO LARGE TO FIT ON  THE
DESTINATION TRACK.

     WHEN NIBBLES AWAY ][ FINDS A SECTOR OF DATA, IT LOOKS FORWARD IN THE DATA
TO FIND A SECOND OCCURANCE OF THE SAME PATTERN.   THIS INSURES THAT THE SECTOR
HAS  BEEN READ IN AND LOCATED CORRECTLY.   ON MANY DISKS,  THERE IS A  PRIMARY
SECTION  OF  DATA,  CALLED THE ADDRESS FIELD,  AND THE THE ACTUAL  DATA  FIELD
FOLLOWS.   IN BETWEEN THESE IS A SMALL GAP,  AND MANY TIMES IT CONTAINS RANDOM
INFORMATION.   THIS MEANS THAT NIBBLES AWAY ][ SHOULD ONLY MATCH THE NUMBER OF
BYTES WHICH ARE FOUND IN THE ADDRESS FIELD, SINCE THE BYTES IN THE GAP MAY NOT
READ AS THE SAME VALUE EVERY TIME.  THE PARAMETER FIND MAX CONTROLS THE NUMBER
OF  BYTES WHICH ARE CHECKED DURING THIS PROCEDURE.   THE DEFAULT VALUE OF  $0C
WORKS  IN  MOST CASES,  BUT SOME DISKS USE A SMALLER ADDRESS FIELD  WHICH  MAY
REQUIRE  THIS  PARAMETER  TO BE SET TO A  SMALLER  VALUE.   HOWEVER,  IF  THIS
PARAMETER  IS SET TOO LOW,  THEN NIBBLES AWAY ][ MAY IDENTIFY THE MATCH FOR  A
SECTION OF DATA WHOSE FIRST FEW BYTES ARE THE SAME, BUT WHICH DIFFER LATER ON.
THEREFORE ONE SHOULD EXCERSIZE CAUTION WHEN LOWERING THIS VALUE.

         FUN STUFF FOR SYSOPS
---------------------------------------
First, you must be a sysop. 
(Obviously!) Or, you may be at a 
sysop's house (When he or she is not
around.)

Second, you must be VERY popular,
or VERY daring. Either way, your
victim will have a strong dendency
to: a) crash your board, b) hate you, 
or c) spread malicious rumors about
you, and, or your board to everyone
in the world that will listen.
 
    I am going to write about AE
fun first, and then Net-Worx. 
 
 
                AE Fun
                -- ---
 
    So you are bored, and want to
have some fun, huh?
    Go into your room, or wherever
you have your apple, and sit down.
Turn on the monitor, and lets see
if there is a leech on the line.
(-note: if you are the unlucky type,
I suggest that you give this up,
because for all you know, that sysop
of the 20meg board is on your line,
and he's going to be your victim!!)
   Now for some of these pranks, you
will need to make things before-
hand. I suggest you read this through,
and make the necessary mods. 
 
1) This one is probably my meanest
trick, and should only be used on
people like Matt Ackerett, or Little
Al.
   Your victim has to be leeching
a game off of your AE for this to
work.
   You wait until your victim is at
his last 2 blocks of memeory to go
until the transfer is done, and
you take out the disk. 
   This will ruin the >entire<
transmission. It won't piss them off
too bad if it is only 50 or so blocks,
but can you imagine:
 
Send: Matt Ackerett is a fag
290 blocks
crc=167
<289>
 
    Note- The victim has to get 290
blocks, you only let the victim get
289!
 
 
   At that point, take out the disk!
They have just waited 1/2 hour for
nothing! They can't get the last block
and have to go through the whole
thing again!! Ha ha!  
   This is very mean, especially if
they aren't phreaking, they have
been >paying< for it all!
 
             
2) If you want to see if the person
on is intelligent...simply let him
catalog your drive once, then when he
is done, take the disk out, and 
put in the disk from the other drive.
When they catalog the disk next, it 
will be different!
   This will freak them out, they will
think that they have switched to d1
somehow. The victim will then L)og the
drive, and find it still on D2. Wow!
   Hopefully they will catalog D1 
anyway, thinking that they were
originally on D1 and it switched.
Now comes the fun. 
   Put the right disk back in D2, 
and put the disk that used to be in D2
into D1, so they will get the same 
catalog.
   Now they are confused. Now
they will catalog D2, and find the
normal stuff. Hopefull they will
read something, now take the disk
out while they are typing in the name,
and slip the other disk in. It
will say 'file not found.'
   Good. Now they will catalog it,
and look! The wares have changed!
Now something is wrong here! They
will say:
 
hey! stop it!
 
   Oh no! They are on to your scheme!
But, 1 last joke! Get a copy-protected
type disk, one that you <gasp> bought.
They won't be able to catalog this
at all! Ha!
   If they get mad, they might
say something like:
 
        Hey! Stop it!
   
   But will you listen? nnnoooooo!
Take the disk out, and slip something
totally new, preferably the disk that
has "sneakers" or some ancient wares.
Maybe they will think these are the
latest! Watch them post!:
 
      Hey! I just got some new 
      Warez! Do you want to trade??
 
hah hah!
 
  Satisfied, you may put the normal
disks back in and walk off to see
some football game.
 
3) Lock out the space-bar. This will
make it so that they can't type a
<space>. Then, they can't read
anything that requires a space. 
Most likely the victim will think that
there is something wrong with >his< 
computer. Thusly sending him/her/it
into a 1/2 hour scan of their install
program to see what is wrong.
 
4) Change the commands...such as:
 
d)irectory= c)irectory
-           -
 
   They will have to hack at the 
commands! This won't be too funny,
because they won't do anything stupid
like posting:
 
     hey your commands are screwed!
  
   Most likely they wont find the 
command for 'copy'.
 
 
5) lock out the "ctrl-c". This will
piss them off when the victim just
can't exit from posting. Ha!
 
6) Change the ring count, most, or
almost >all< AE lines are set to 
pick up after just 1 ring. Change it
to...say...5 rings, and only tell your
friends that it is at 5 rings. When
they call, they will only wait for 
about 2 rings, and hang up thinking
that the line is down. Only the people
you like will get on, because they 
will be the only ones to wait 5 rings.
Mean huh?
 
7) When someone is posting, or c)opy-
ing a message, pick up the voice line,
and blow into the reciever. This will
put all of these weird characters onto
the screen. He will save a gay looking
message, that will make it look like
the victim can't type!! 
 
 
               Net Works
               --- -----
 
   I don't have as many fun tricks
with net-worx as I do with AE, but
here are a couple of my favorites...
 
1) In the program, make a bug, like
"ctrl-k" that when pushed (like ctrl-t
for chat) it will dump you into basic.
take out the disks, and put in like 
the "bare-bones" net-worx disk and let
them have fun reading fake messages,
mail, and passwords. Ooooh! They will
think:
 
oh yay! I have everyone's pass!
 
Now, see if he/she will init the 
disks, if they do, you know what type
of user it is. If they are nice,
and 'hang' the line for you so that
no one wil be able to get on after,
or they try to beep you, then give 
them a level raise.
 
2) Be a tyrant. Juggle their levels
while they are on. Like break into
chat, change their level, and watch
them get all mad. 
 
3) Break into chat, and just walk off,
leaving a frustrated user sitting
there.
 
4) break into chat, and change the
time. In other words, leave them
with -10 minutes, instead of 35 or
so.
 
5) when they log off, and they get
that stupid message about:
 
            Thank you for
              calling
 
and all of that, press 'ctrl-c' a
few times, and they will be brought
back. Wow! What happened? Let them
try to log off a few times nd keep
pressing ctrl-c. Finally they should
just press 'reset'. He he!
 
 
    I hope you have enjoyed these
little pranks. Your users will hate
you if you do this too often, unless
they are like Matt Ackeret or Little
Al. Then it doesn't matter much.
    Remember! I hold no responsibilty
for people wanting to crash your 
system because they are so pissed
at you!
