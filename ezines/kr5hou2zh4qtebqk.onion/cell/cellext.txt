NOW!!!!    TWO CELLULAR PHONES  (or 3)   ONE NUMBER    ONE BILL


Thank you for your inquiry about Cellular Extensions. 

* Included is an explanation of our services and some important guidelines.
  
     Cellular Extensions makes it easy and affordable for you to have two 
cellular phones, with only one phone number, one monthly service charge and 
one bill.

     Now you can add an extra cellular phone to your second car, 
your boat or your briefcase.  The technology to accomplish this has been
available for several years, but is expensive for a carrier to provide.

     Through Cellular Emulation,  it's quick, easy and inexpensive.

How does it work?

     Cellular Extensions will service your phone to allow for an extension.  
The technology works best with Motorola phones, but other phones can be 
processed as well. You send us the phone, and in days, the phone will be 
sent back to you, ready to go. Your serviced phone will maintain its 
original security. The original manufacturer's software will not change, nor
will anything be physically added to your phone which might violate the
phone's FCC type approval.

What does it cost?* 

*   $300 - $350 - using your own secondary phone, based on the  type and make
    of the phone.

*   $485 includes a used Motorola (pt550) flip-phone & (2 batteries, charger, 
    cig. adaptor)

*   $585 includes a new Motorola (pt550) flip-phone & (2 batteries, charger, 
    cig. adaptor)

*   $675 w/ a new Motorola (pt950-Alpha) flip-phone & (2 batteries, charger, 
    cig. adaptor)

*   $1025 w/ new Motorola - Micro Tac Ultra Light w/vibrator & (2 batt.,
    charger, cig. adpt.)

*  All prices include return shipping via UPS 2-Day Air Service

** Call or E-mail for prices using your own phone
(Missouri residents add 6.25% tax on equipment:  subtract Standard Emulation
from prices listed above, diff. = equip. cost X 8.25% = tax)

****SPECIAL OFFER:  We will do your secondary "Motorola" phone for $250, 
or even less by signing up to our wholesale long distant service. Depending 
on your current long distant bill, savings of the total cost of the Extension 
and several hundred dollars per month off your long distant bill.
 
****(Offer applies to "Motorola" cellular phones only.)***

What are my savings?

Multiply the month cellular service fee your paying now times 12, times the
number of years you've had your phone & add the activation fee (generally
$45); and that's before buying a phone

(Example: $35/month X 12 = $420 X 2 = $840 + $45/act = $885)

You may be paying significantly more or slightly less for your service plan.

How soon can I get it set-up?

You send us your phone, a completed order form and payment, and in a matter
of days your extension will be up and running. An order form is included
with this information.

Best Applications

A Cellular extension works best when the second phone is a light use only
phone. This is because legally, both phones cannot be used at the same time.
Extensions are perfect when you want to add cellular phones to your other
cars for security and convenience. They're also ideal, if you want a
portable phone for when you leave your car. Where cost may have been a
factor in the past, now you can easily add a cellular phone to your
motorcycle, boat, RV or plane.

TWO CELLULAR PHONES      ONE NUMBER       ONE BILL 

And people can reach you at one phone number. It's great for security,
convenience--and it's affordable.  Now every member of your family can have
the security of a cellular phone. Extensions are a great tool for
entrepreneurs and growing businesses, who want something more immediate than
a beeper. If you decide to change Cellular Carriers or you move to another
city - all you have to do is activate you primary cellular phone - your C241
"Cellular Extension" will be working too, automatically.

Is it legal?  DEFINITELY!

Yes, it's legal.  There are some important points you need to follow, the
most important rule being, you cannot use both phones simultaneously.
Important Points to Remember

* Due to deficiencies in the established system, ONLY ONE UNIT can be on at a
time. If more than one phone is in use, you may be in violation of your
carrier's tarrifs. In some instances, your service may be interrupted or
even terminated due to the electronic security measures utilized by the
carrier.

* This service is available to you from information provided by you and at
your request. We will not assume liability for:

1.  the use or non-use of phones; or,

2.  any failure to observe any laws or regulations; or,

3.  any use which might constitute either theft of services; or,

4.  any use for fraudulent purposes whatsoever.

*  Should your Primary (activated) phone be stolen, report it to your carrier
immediately. Do not attempt to use the secondary phone since it may be
blocked by the carrier. Any attempt to use the phone may result in
investigation for using a reportedly stolen phone.

*  Should your secondary (emulated) phone be stolen, request a number change
from your carrier. After this change has been made, your phone may have the
number programmed. Then call us at immediately. We will advise you of the
procedure to have the new phone work with the existing phone.

*   Should you decided to sell your secondary (emulated) phone, or return it
to the manufacturer for warranty work, call us and we will reset it to its
original parameters. There will be a nominal charge plus freight for this
service.

Options:

Once you have a Cellular "Extension" it will work with cellular carriers
world-wide; if you decide to move - just have your primary phone activated
and your extension will be working too. If you switch Cellular Carriers, your
Cellular Extension will work as well. You are not limited to just one
cellular extension - you have as many Cellular Extensions as you want,
all working on the same cellular phone number, still with one monthly service
charge and one cellular bill.
