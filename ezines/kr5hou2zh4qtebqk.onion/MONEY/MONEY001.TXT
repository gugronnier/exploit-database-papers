Welcome to the Money Incoproated Textmag Issue Number 1!!!

     These mags are dedicated to spreding our right-wing views in the extremely leftist
world of computers.  Most cool anarchists, fortunately havent succumbed to the left
wing media, and followed the "Great Satan" Clinton.....well that gives a bad name to
Satan....maybe he's just a great asshole.  This is issue is dedicated to the animal
rights movement.  The companies that I'm about to list for you are out of a PETA
(People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals) list of companies to boycott for their
testing of products on animals.  For this narrow-minded "put animals before people"
policy, they have become the first victim of Money Inc.  Give these companies your
business when possible, and maybe drop them a line letting them knwo that you still
stand behind them. Of course, if you're a weakling commie-pinko and want to boycott
them, you have the perfect right to....and you have the perfect right to fuck off!

   Anywayz, I will also give you the number of PETA, so you can harass them, wardial
them, CNA the number and find the house and firebomb it, etc.  The number is:
PETA +1 301 770 PETA (how fuckin original)

or girlfriend purchase these products when at all possible....fax a note to the
companies and let them know that the majority of America may be against them, but
you still support them, and you will continue to buy their products!!!

   These PETA people must be stopped.  In the newsletter I recieved, given to my
girlfriend when she bought a cat, there were several articles that sickened me!!!
The first has a picture of a turkey and pleaded with the reader not to eat turkey
for Thanksgiving, calling it a senseless tradition!!!!  What a crock!!!

   The next article was a blow at Beavis and Butthead.  What a shame, a stupid
pointless cartoon, being blasted for depiction of animal abuse.  Beavis and Butthead
are called "sexist, racist, and in every way distasteful."  Exactly, that's why I
watch every fucking day.

   The newsletter is littered with pleas for donations.  On tha back page alone, there
are three seperate forms of donation forms, including get this: A form for people to
fill out, so when they die, instead of sending flowers, the mourners can sent money to
PETA!  This shameless money-grubbing, tree-hugging must stop.

   So remember, buy lots of cosmetics (tested on animals, of course), kill stray cats
and dogs, and EAT LOTS OF RED MEAT!!!!!!  Don't let these leftist commies tell you what
to eat, wear, put in your hair, or watch on TV....THIS WILL STOP!!!!
