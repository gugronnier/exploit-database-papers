   Ok, say you have a bunch of extra Visa and Mastercards around the house,
and you're not quite sure what to do with them.  Maybe some cards that you
used once or twice and aren't sure if they're still worth much.  Here's
where the 1-800-CALL-ATT SCAM comes into play.  The basic principle behind
CALL-ATT is to offer callers various methods of dialing out using various
options of payment.  To those vets in the H/P field, this may sound
familiar.  Yes, it's a remake of the MCI owned ITI services everybody used
and abused a few years ago!  You can conviently make those necessary long
distance calls without needing to worry about your 950 dying or a nosy
operator asking for more red box tones!

   Jot down a few cards and expiration dates, and carry them with ya.  When
you need to make a call, just dial 1-800-CALL-ATT, press '2' to bill to a
major credit card, punch in the ACN, then the card # and exp. date.  That
simple!  If you're gonna support a company, why not support AT&T?!
