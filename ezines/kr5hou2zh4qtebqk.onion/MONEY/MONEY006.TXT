   Ok, say you want to beigebox and you're a complete dolt and can't solder.  You have
no friends, and if you did you couldn't pay one to solder some alligator clips on some
phone wire.  Here's what you can do....

   1.  Find someone to drive you around until you find one of those GTE
       buildings.  Do this late at night, and go in isolated areas...

   2.  This should be no problem, since GTE buildings are usually isolated,
       either in small towns or right off a major road.

   3.  Have your friend park across the street, and run across the street.

   4.  Run up to the GTE truck (by the way, only go to the buildings with
       GTE trucks...duh)

   5.  Break the window....the best way to do this is to take a bit of ceramic
       broken off of a spark plug.  This is virtually noiseless and completely
       spider-webs the window.

   6.  The will be a console between the front seats, the testphone will be
       the orange device on the console.  Grab it and run back to the car.

   7.  Do this at all of the GTE buildings in one night...since, once they
       discover a test phone missing, they'll be more secure for a few weeks.

   8.  If you get lucky you may get a touch tone test phone, but more than
       likely it'll be a pulse fone....

   9.  Happy phreaking....AND DON'T GET CAUGHT...if you do get caught, you
       thought this up on your own....now go and trash some GTE trucks!
