Why publish?

(A sort of tribute to Factsheet 5)

by Miekael

Argh, I always get in a very peculiar mood when I'm about to try to
explain the reasons of my behaviour. This is going to be a rant with
no specific ideas behind apart from it vaguely having something to do
with the publishing of zines and underground literature.

Well, what was it I was going to be ranting about? Oh, yes, just
recently I came by a posting on ZINE-L about a permanent section in
the late Factsheet 5 called 'Why publish?'. Apparantly the section was
open for any zine editor who wanted to get rid of a lot of reasons for
publishing a zine. A great idea. I need a wastebasket of some sort as
well, so I'm going to try and write something about why I'm still
hanging on to this e-zine instead of just jumping around in the room
shivering of frustration for lack of time to finish project #4711 in
my list.

I can sometimes be caught saying something about this being fun and
that I love to write and force my opinions on other people, but that's
not the primary reason for me to write and compile articles for a zine
like this. Not at all. You see, in real life, not this poor excuse of
an illusion, I'm an orange secret agent. The oranges wants to be aware
of what we people think and why they act like they do, eating oranges
and drinking orange juice for breakfast. I bet you would be somewhat
suspicious too if your friends had been squezed to juice for someone's
breakfast. The best way the oranges have come up with so far to get to
know these things is to eavesdrop on that odd collection of people
called zine publishers. They get to know a great deal using the
method, but I just wonder if they get to know what they're really
after... Bah! Who cares what an orange thinks anyway? I'm just doing
my job or whatever I could call it.

I don't really like writing. I just say so sometimes. I don't know
why, really. It's more having written that is fun, not the actual
punching of keys. Who said that writing was an intellectual labour
anyhow? They should feel the feedback of my keyboard. All this doesn't
mean I don't like having the oppurtunity to make you read this. I like
the very idea that people use up their time on earth reading shit like
this. On the other hand, I spent more time writing it than they will
be spending reading it. Ah. There's no justice.

Timothy Leary has written something about control in the 21st century.
He babbled something about the people of the world watching cathode
ray tubes more than the eyes of their own family. He's right, you
know. I've been stuck here with my poor beast of writing equipment for
ages and haven't even looked in my son's eyes for about a century. Ok,
a couple of hours at least. And now it's too late. I'm losing time, my
son's gone to bed and I want to be finished with this about minus four
hours ago. Mr. Leary also wrote something about people in control of
their own mind edits their own CRT, the others are being programmed as
they watch a CRT they have no control over. Ha! Guess who's editing
and who's being programmed?

This is what zines are all about; control. Who's got the control over
media? Try examining the megacorporations controlling the media in
different countries and you'll see a pattern, a common pattern. All
newspapers, magazines, major TV channels and radio stations are owned
by a small group of people. These are the controllers of your mind!
No, I guess they're not the Illuminatus, but it *is* a bloody
conspiracy.

Look around you. Everywhere there are messages from these media
giants. And you just take it all in. Everyone just take it all in.
Some believe what they digest as well. These people are in great
trouble. The oranges are not taking over, the media giants are! Don't
drink orange juice tomorrow morning -- seize the media!

Ok, not all media is propaganda machines a la Goebbels. The
alternative media scene truly exists. It's not just a Robert Crumb
fantasy that there are alternative comics & zines & pirate radio
stations & community TV channels & the alt.hierarchy & mailing lists &
spunk press & loompanics unlimited & a lot of people taking things
less seriously than Springer Verlag. We're hee! Not a lot of oranges,
but real people with a relaxed attitude...

Zines are a lot like punk music. In the punk scene the audience at one
concert are very often on stage at the next and vice versa. The same
thing is here, within the zine scene; people mix a lot, zine editors
and zine readers are the same people. You can't see any walls between
your Random J. Zine-Reader and your Random J. Zine-Editor as you can
see between the journalists of the mainstream press and it's readers.
Zines are about banging a lot of heads, while still on the stiff body
of the reader, against the wall of professional journalism and
commercialism. And I'm going to continue to bang my head, both as a
reader and an editor (perhaps not in P@ Online, but elsewhere), until
there's a hole in the wall. If it's big enough for an issue of P@
Online that's enough. Then I'll pick up a box of matches, light the
issue (the special fuse issue, coming soon), and await the BLAST!



Editorial from the U.S.A.

by Chuck
This e-zine will now be moving to a monthly schedule.  We need you to make
sure that you tell us when your e-address changes.  We also need news from
your area, accounts of practical projects, letters, news of new resources,
zine and media reviews, and articles.
 
In other news, I'm reassured that my expectations of Clinton's presidency
have been exceeded by his desire to be just like George Bush.  I'm also
constantly horrified by Democrats who urge us to support him "because at
least he isn't George Bush" or "at least he hasn't executed anybody yet." 
He may not have yet approved the state murder of anybody in the U.S. but he
has already killed an artist and other people in Iraq.  Let's see, we can
also count the Americans killed in Somalia as well as Somalis killed.  News
reports today say that this CIA guy killed in Georgia was part of a covert
operation.  Covert ops already?  Are the Democrats really that different
from the Republicans?  I guess I don't get it.

The pope is supposed to arrive in Denver today.  Pope, go home!

April 1993
PO Box 3207

A collaborative effort of a bunch of anarchists in Indiana.  Some of these
folks have put out other zines.  Book reviews, cartoons, essays,

The New Hampshire Gazette  February 1992 o This is one of those great small
town alternative rags that are always a joy to come across.  These

community-based presses.  They are usually put out by one person--in this
case Steven Fowle. The Gazette includes a daily log of commentary on
contemporary news.  This issue also has short pieces on the native Hawaiian

music and book reviews.  [PO Box 9382, Reno, NV 89507. $2]

Shelf Life #1
1631 Santa Rosa Ave.
Santa Barbara, CA 93109
$1 or trade
Hand-lettered and illustrated zines usually get a bad rap in reviews,
sometimes justifiably so, but this is a coherent, intelligent, readable
first effort.  Most of Sheryl's pub is a personalzine, with a guide to her
hometown, concert reviews, and autobiographical pieces.  The rest is a
collage of her written and illustrated thoughts on anarchy and life. 
Highly recommended.

SLAM #2   February/MArch 1993 o Another good place to get your zine
reviewed.  They also have several band interviews in each issue, as well as
fiction, articles and rants. [PO Box 22861, Alexandria, VA 22304, $2. 
$10/six issues]

Slingshot  #48  Spring 1993 o An excellent and informative anarchist
newspaper out of central California.  They have news like other
anarcho-publications, but I like the practical emphasis found in many of
the articles.  I want less rhetoric and more how-to!  Fans of Practical
Anarchy might like this one too.  700 Eshlecreature Hall, Berkeley, CA
94720.

Squat or Rot 3 o A newspaper about the squatting scene in New York City. 
Part of it doubles as liner notes for the 7" that came with it.  The record
has songs from five hardcore bands.  [PO Box 20691, New York, NY 10009]

The Struggle  v.2 / July 1992 o A punk zine covering the Chicago scene. 
[CS Productions.  POB 29556.  Chicago, IL 60629.  $1]

These are Revolutionary Times  Issues 1 & 2 o  A new anarchist newspaper
that shows a lot of promise.  A collective effort that celebrates the DIY
ethic in Rhode Island.  [T.A.R.T., Wayland Square, Box 3146, Providence, RI
02906. $1]

The Thistle   various April 1993 issues o A good alternative college
newspaper.  Wish my schools had something that looked like this and came
out on a regualr basis.  [Alternative News Collective. MIT W20-413, 84
Massachusetts Ave., Cambridge, MA 02139-0901 (thistle@athena.mit.edu)]

Turning The Tide: anti-racism newsletter  Vol. 5: #6 / November-December

opinion from the Canadian Pacific northwest.  Several pieces on tax
protests and government excesses.  These folks aren't left libertarians,
but this newsletter should interest anarcho-capitalists.  [Greater

Tools Collective
        "Alternative" by definition means something which stands in
opposition to a set order.  To honestly define our community as such, we
must actively oppose the commercialism, prejudice, and hierarchy of the
world around us through our actions and lifestyles.  Simply consuming
different music and clothes, while continuing the bankrupt traditions of
mainstream society ultimately makes us no better than those we claim to
despise.  We are all responsible for the state of our communities, and
every day we work towards eiter the continuation or the elimination of the
emptiness and the stagnation in our society.
        As a group, Tools Collective hopes to provide a means by which our
community as a whole can begin to realize its tremendous potential for
real, progressive change, while fostering a fun atmosphere.  We are working
to eliminate the forces of racism, sexism, homophobia, and elitism which
have been so successful in disrupting efforts of positive growth in the
past.  To achieve these goals, we are providing an open forum to serve as
both an exchange for information and a point of organization.  Topics of
discussion at our weekly meetings and activities which the group has
participated in consist of: self-education, direct social and political
action, distribution of literature, organization of benefit shows, and the
maintenance of a space in which to build a community center.  Our space is
located in the Allston Mall at 107 Brighton Avenue, Allton.  Please stop
by.  [editor's note--near Boston Massachusetts]

by the Epicenter Women's Coalition, it's going to be fun, informative, and
hopefully inspiring. Not Riot Grrrl, more like Riot Bytch, we're going to
have a wide variety of workshops, speakers, and literature available for
anyone who waltzes into the Epicenter Zone not-for-profit record
store/community center/library that weekend.

The first day will be "Women in the scene" focusing on women who run record
labels, distributions, and 'zines within the underground music (PUNK!)
subculture, but for all the non-punk women out there, we hope to inspire
them with the "Do-it-yourself" ethic of punk to motivate other women outside
our scene to do their own projects....

The second day will be Women and Politics, featuring women and animals
rights/liberation, the environment, poverty, etc.

The third day will be Women Only due to the fact that it's women's health
care and sexuality day and how many men really want to sit around and hear
about menstruation? Anyway, workshops on sexual abuse and rape will take
place, so due to the sensitive nature of the subjects, men are not allowed.
Don't whine about it either--if you can't understand why a woman would want
to be with other women exclusively when she's revealing for the first time
that was raped or molested, then you're an asshole.

Anyway, I'll be on the informal panel of speakers on women and zines the
first day because of the zine I do called AIM YOUR DICK, an
anarcha-feminist journal...but e-mil me for more infoHon both the zine and
the gathering!
        
Gee, it seems I forgot to mention the location of the Women's
Gathering...duh. Well, the Women's Gathering--as it's called in the interim
until we can think of a clever name--that's happening in San Francisco will
take place all three days--September 4, 5, and 6th--at the Epicenter Zone,
475 Valencia off of 16th Street, in the Mission District. The Epicenter is a
not-for-profit, collectively-run community center, library, and punk fucking
rock record store (no, we do NOT carry anything on a major label: it's
called Do-It-Yourself!) and we are a wonderful bunch of folks. Really.

So the Epicenter Women's Coalition is organizing the event, come, send your
'zines if you'd like for us to sell them if you do a women's/grrrl's zine,
and tell everyone. And don't any of you macho shits decide that it'll be
funny to crash our gathering, because we're angry, we're feminists, and we
wear combat boots! (Vegan ones, of course...)
