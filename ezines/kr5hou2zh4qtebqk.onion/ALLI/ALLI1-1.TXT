  Well, let me tell you little about myself.  I am an avid Hacker and Phreak.
Cracking is kinda new to me, so i stick to the old ways of doing things.  I 
have been hacking my way in systems for a little under 2 years now.  I've seen
some changes in the way things get set up, but I've managed to stay on top.
Here's some stats on me if you're interested:

   Real Name:      Mike something or other...
   Age:            16  (don't laugh!)
   Occupation:     Hazard to my school!  Looking for a job as a programmer.
   Residence:      Beautiful Orlando, FL   (not!  Too many tourists)
   Marital Status: 3-4 times a day.  he he.
   Other:          5'9".  Brown hair, brown eyes, bleah....
   
  OK that just about does it.  I'm humiliating myself enough.

II.>  Lock Picking Tips


                     Picking Combination Locks                    
                                                                  
                                                                  
 The writer of this text file takes <all> responsibility for what 
 this text file is used for. Hopefully it will only be used for   
 illegal purposes cuz i can't think of a reason it can be used for
 legally. Well, on with the text file.                            
                                                                  

     Ok, so ya say ya wanna learn how to pick combination locks...This text 
file should help you. As a matter of fact, if ya do it right, it will help 
you.  First of all, let me tell you about the set-up of a lock.  When the lock
is locked, there is a curved piece of metal wedged inside the little notch 
on the horseshoe shaped bar that is pushed in to the lock when you lock it.
To free this wedge, you must(must is a word used to much) you usually(that 
sounds much better) have to turn the lock to the desired combination and the
pressure on the wedge is released therefore letting the lock open.  I will now
tell you how to make a pick so you can open a lock without having to waste
all that time turning the combination (this also helps when ya don't know the 
combination to begin with).  First of all, ya need to find a hairpin. What's a 
hairpin?  Well, just ask your mom.  She will have one.  If she asks what its 
for, say ya gotta hold something together...  If she says use a rubberband or
use a paperclip, tell her to fuck off and die and then go to the store and rip
off a box of 50 or so.  Ok, enough stalling (yea, i was stalling).  Once you
have your hair pin (make sure its metal), take the ridged side and break it off
right before it starts to make a U-turn onto the straight side.  The curved part
can now be used as a handle.  Now, using a file, file down the other end 
until it is fairly thin.  You should do this to many hairpins and file them
so they are of different thicknesses so you can pick various locks.  Some locks
are so cheap that ya don't even have ta file!  But most are not.  Ok, now you 
have a lock pick.  Now if ya haven't figured it out, here's how ya use it.  
You look at a lock to see which side the lock opens from.  If you can't tell,
you will just have to try both sides.  When ya find out what side it opens from,
take the lock pick and stick the filed end into the inside of the horseshoe-
shaped bar on whichever side the lock opens from.  Now, put pressure on the 
handle of the lock pick (pushing down, into the crack) and pull the lock up and 
down. The lock will then open because the pick separated the wedge and the 
notch allowing us thieves to open it.  Don't say bullshit until you've tried it.

because i have gotten lots of beer money from doin' this to fellow students' 
gym lockers.  Also, this technique works best on American locks.  I have never
picked a Master lock before because of the shape a pressure of the wedge but
if anyone does it, let me know how long it took.  Also, the Master lock casing
is very tight so ya can't get the pick in.  So, if you're locking something
valuable up, use a Master, cuz at least ya know I won't be picking it and I'm
sure there aren't that many that could.  And when i say pick, i don't mean 
lighting a stick of dynamite next to the lock, picking is opening a lock without
using force, making a substitute key, etc...

Here's how to do it:

On almost all vending machines they have those damn round almost unpickable
locks on them so:

When no one is looking quickly press a piece of AIR-HARDENING clay into the
lock.  (Press hard enough to get a good impression.)

Remove the clay carefully and let it dry for however long the clay has to dry
as specified on the package.

You now have a key to fit that lock, (this Type of 'key' can be easily crushed
if you're seen.  But if you're smart you won't though)

Before we start, if you are friends with counselors that let you borrow 
their keys, steal the master for all the lockers in your school. You may 
now ignore the rest of this file.

:=> What You Need
 3/8" Hex Driver
 Adjustable Wrench(es)
 Needlenose Pliers
 Moby Pliers (Vise-Grips work REAL 
              well!)
 6" Steel Rod or Small Crow Bar
 Small Standard Screwdriver
 Large Standard Screwdriver
 Phillipshead Screwdriver
 Moderate Size Claw Hammer

:=> Taking Over
  At the beginning of each school year, there are a good deal of unused 
lockers around the school. If one of these is near your next class, slap a 
padlock on it; we'll get into putting a school lock on it later...
  Every school has at least one designated "Garbage Locker". Find it 
(them), they can be used to your advantage!
  If a locker you want already has an owner, no problem! Read the next 
section for more information...
  If you have a large suppy of padlocks (which every locker 
destroyer has!), be sure to put them on the ones that you want so you'll 
have it later when we go to put a school-issued lock on it later.

:=> Getting In
  Now the real challenge begins! The hardest part of all of this is 
getting in the thing in the first place! But it's easy if you know the 
tricks of the trade:
> Padlocks (Combination or Key)
  Here's where we get to use the crow bar! Slip it between the lock and the 
latch on the locker, while going between the two rods of the shank. 
Apply serious downward force. This takes 'em off so disgustingly easily. 
it's not fair! As a matter of fact, we can rip Master key locks off with 
a crummy hex driver!

> Destroying the Thing
  If you are so pissed as to rip the lock off and take over by force, be 
sure this is your last resort! You leave little marks on the paint, but
a cheap can of canary yellow or what ever color you loker may be will take
care of that. Get the crowbar again. One end should fit between the dial
and the door. If not, pry it open a little with one of the screwdrivers.
Rip the dial off without mercy. The lock itself will fall inside the locker
after the bolts snap and will be free for opening! If you can get a 
new dial for the lock you ripped off, try to get it on so you have another 
usable lock.

> Going Through The Combination
  Getting in this way is rare, but welcomed. Spend an afternoon 
wandering the halls looking at the walls, ledges, doors, around a 
lockers wherever a combination can be written without being easily seen. If 
you find one, try it out-CAREFULLY! Once you get one that works, steal 
it! 
 
> Pennied Lockers
  Now we're talking REALLY rare! But these are real easy to spot. Walk 
around looking at the latch. If it is sticking up a mile higher than the 
others, give it a tug. Some of them stick that high naturally or if the 
locker is over-filled, so watch for those.

:=> Once You're In
  All right, you FINALLY got the locker open and the lock is intact. 
Look around. Steal anything of value. Now, let's get the lock, ok? See 
those two nuts above and below the lock on the inside of the door? Get 
the 3/8" hex driver and remove them. Now grab the dial and the lock and 
pull free from the door. Try not to move the dial-it's a real pain in the 
ass getting it back right! Refasten the nuts and take it to new location, 
and re-install it on the new locker repeating the steps. If the dial does
not go in at first, frob with it awhile until it seats into the lock.
Congrats! You now have just taken over your first locker!

> Ripping Out The Walls!
  If you are on the right side of a wall, you can remove it with little
difficulty and get into the locker next to yours. Use the same hex driver
and unfasten the nuts holding it in. Watch out for the shelf, though!

:=> Garbage Lockers
  As mentioned above, garbage lockers can be very useful. These usually
evidant the first 2-3 months of school. They reach maturity in about 1-6
months depending on use. The custodians come and clean and
disinfect it thoroughly, killing wahtever new forms of life you may
have developed. They then will usually put a school-owned padlock on it.
Now, scince it's clean, and you know how to get padlocks off, we say it's
ripe for picking!
  You previously have been opening lockers seeing if they are worth
conquering, and how come across a trash locker. Maybe you contributed
an unwanted apple, someone's homework, etc to it. You suddenly
notice one day that the janitors have taken it over. Immediately, you
snap the lock off and you have a nice clean locker.

:=> When To Do Your Vandalism
 1. At lunch
 2. Skip a period
 3. After school
(1) Possibly hard to do. Either no one is allowed around school or
everyone is eating at their lockers.
(2) May cause difficulties. That is, unless you are already failing that
class.
(3) This is great. Join some stupid club and then leave early everyday.
Now you have enough time to swipe a few! You could also get a job
at school with the janitors or as a techie. Now you have lots of time
when the school is empty and you have access to MORE TOOLS!

:=> Rating Of Padlocks By Brand
> Combination
  Guard- This is the cheapest piece of shit that we've ever run across!
The case is undoubtedly in two peices, and most often, there are cracks
around the edges. Now turn it over and look on the back. See those two rivets?
We took TWO of these off with a SNEAKER!
  American- Okay. Getting a little harder to get off now. The shank is
'left-handed', and the dial is firmly secured.
  Master- Supposedly 'top-of-the-line', but still can be removed with a little
pressure. LEAN ON THAT MOTHER!

> Key
  Master- Several million of these, no reason to break one off as of yet.
  Sears- One peice case, gave us a little trouble to take off with
our hex driver.

:=> Glossary Of Most-Used Terms

This tutorial will demonstrate how to "pick" a pin tumbler lock.  Use of this
material is for locksmiths only, any use of this information for illegal 
purposes is forbidden and against the law. (as long as we are at it, do you
want to buy some land in Florida?)

In order to pick a pin tumbler lock, you will require four items: a lock,
you, a pick, and a tension wrench. you can ussually get these at a locksmith
store, if you can not find one near you there will be an address at the end of
the article that you can order them from. Here is an illustration of a pick
and a tension wrench:

     ________/   !________
      pick         tension wrench

Most people know of the need for the pick, but have no idea what the wrench
is for.  It is very important and without it it would be impossible to pick
a lock.

In order to pick a lock, we must count upon the imperfection of the lock.
Before we look at how to actually pick the lock, we will look at the parts of
it and how the imperfection part fits in.  Here is a dissassembled lock:

When you insert a key into a lock, the bottem pins are pushed up, and if it
is the proper key, the tops of the bottom pins will match with the spot 
where the plug and housing meet, thus allowing you to turn the plug, and open
the door, etc.. When you inser the key, the bottom pins go into the valleys of
the key, thus meaning that the key must have the right height valleys to make
the lock open. Pretty elementry, right? Well now we can move on to how to pick
a lock.

In order to pick a lock we (as i said before) depend on the inaccuracy of the
manufacturing process. The first thing to do is to insert the tension wrench
into the lock and apply a slight pressure to the left (or right if you
wish) so that if you could look inside the lock at where the plug and the
housing would meet, it would look like this:

               ! !*! !
     housing   ! !*! !
               ! !*! !
     __________! !*! !___________
     __________  !*! ____________
              !  !*!!
     plug     !  !_!!
              !   _ !
              !  !*!!
              !  \_/!

Now a slight presure is on the pins. Because the pins can not be produced
exactly the same, there is one pin which is the widest and there fore has
more tension on it, and one which is the thinnest and has almost no pressure
on it. We now use the pick to >gently< push each pin up (and try to feel it 
when you let it down) until we find which is the tightest on and which is
loosest. Getting the feel for this is the hardest part of lock picking. Now
that you have found the loosest one, gently press it upward until you feel
a slight reduction in tension on the tension wrench. This will happen when
the top of the bottom pin becomes even with the junction of the plug and
the housing. DO NOT RELEASE ANY TENSION FROM THE WRENCH NOW! The driver will
now be trapped in the housing as illustrated here: (don't I draw pretty)

            ! !*! !
   housing  ! !*! !

               !     !

Now you continue this process with each of the pins until you work your way up
to the one that is widest. With some practice you can get fairly fast at
this. I suggest practicing on a four pin tumbler lock that is bought from a
hardware store, the cheaper the better.

I would like to discuss a paticular configuration of the pins now that may
present a particularly hard job to pick. This is graphicly shown here by
the two middle pins:

        !*! !*! !*! !*!
        !*! !*! !_! !*!
        !*! !*!  _  !*!
        !_! !*! !*! !_!
         _  !*! !*!  _
        !*! !*! !*! !*!
        !*! !_! !*! !*!
        !*!  _  !*! !*!
        !*! !*! !*! !*!
        \_/ \_/ \_/ \_/

             \_______________

When you try to push the 2nd pin from
the left up, you will unavoidably be
pushing the one in front of it up be-
cause of it's long bottom pin. the only
solution for this is to get a special
pick that looks like this:

         \
          \   _______________
           \_/

The major problem with this is that it is hard to initially detect. The reason
that it makes it harder if it is not immedietly apperant is that you un-
avoidably push the 3rd pin from the left up into the housing, getting it
jammed:

             ! !*! !
   housing   ! !_! !
             !  _  !
             ! !*! !
   __________! !*! !________
   ___________ !*! ________
              !!*!!   
     plug     !!*!!
              !\_/!


I would also like to address a technique called raking. it uses a
tool like this:

        \/\/\/\___________

Basicly you "rake" it back and forth across the pins, hoping that combined
with the tension it will give you the right combination. This way has been
known to work fast sometimes, but is not very reliable, and I would suggest
learning to actually "pick" the lock.

SO YOU WANT TO BE A CRIMINAL. WELL, IF YOU ARE WANTING TO BE LIKE JAMES BOND
 AND OPEN A LOCK IN FIFTEEN SECONDS, GO TO HOLLYWOOD BECAUSE THAT'S THE ONLY
 PLACE YOUR GONNA DO IT. EVEN EXPERIENCED LOCKSMITHS CAN SPEND 5 TO 10 MINUTES
 ON A LOCK IF THEY'RE UNLUCKY. IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR EXTREMELY QUICK ACCESS,
 LOOK ELSEWHERE.
  THE FOLLOWING INSTRUCTIONS WILL PERTAIN MOSTLY TO THE "LOCK-IN-KNOB" TYPE
 LOCK, SINCE IT IS THE EASIEST TO PICK. IF THERE IS SUFFICIENT DEMAND, I WILL
 LATER WRITE A FILE DISCUSSING THE OTHER FORMS OF ENTRANCE, INCLUDING DEAD-BOLT

FIRST OF ALL, YOU NEED A PICK SET. IF YOU KNOW A LOCKSMITH, GET HIM TO MAKE YOU
 A SET. THIS WILL BE THE BEST POSSIBLE SET FOR YOU TO USE. IF YOU FIND A
 LOCKSMITH WILLING TO SUPPLY A SET, DON'T GIVE UP HOPE. IT IS POSSIBLE TO MAKE
 YOUR OWN, IF YOU HAVE ACCESS TO A GRINDER (YOU CAN USE A FILE, BUT IT TAKES
 FOREVER.)

THE THING YOU NEED IS AN ALLEN WRENCH SET (VERY SMALL). THESE SHOULD BE SMALL
 ENOUGH TO FIT INTO THE KEYHOLE SLOT. NOW, BEND THE LONG END OF THE ALLEN
 WRENCH AT A SLIGHT ANGLE..(NOT 90 DEG.) IT SHOULD LOOK SOMETHING LIKE THIS:

  #1
       \\
        \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\s\\\\\\\         (THIS IS THE HANDLE
                                           \\\        THAT WAS ALREADY
                                           \\\        (HERE.)
                                           \\\
                                           \\\
                                           \\\

NOW, TAKE YOUR PICK TO A GRINDER OR A FILE AND SMOOTH THE END (#1) UNTIL IT'S
 ROUNDED SO IT WON'T HANG INSIDE THE LOCK.  TEST YOUR TOOL OUT ON DOORKNOBS AT
YOUR HOUSE TO SEE IF IT WILL SLIDE IN AND OUT SMOOTHLY.
 NOW, THIS IS WHERE THE SCREWDRIVER COMES IN. IS IT SMALL ENOUGH FOR IT AND
YOUR PICK TO BE USED IN THE SAME LOCK AT THE SAME TIME, ONE ABOVE THE OTHER ?
LETS HOPE SO, BECAUSE THAT'S THE ONLY WAY YOUR GONNA OPEN IT.

IN THE COMING INSTRUCTIONS, PLEASE REFER TO THIS CHART OF THE INTERIOR OF A
LOCK:

XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX| K
 #  #  #  #   #   #    | E
    #     #   #   #    | Y
 *     *               | sH
 *  *  *  *   *   *    | O
                       | L
                       | E
XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX|

#= UPPER TUMLER PIN
*= LOWER TUMLER PIN
X= CYLINDER WALL

(THIS IS A GREATLY SIMPLIFIED DRAWING)

THE OBJECT IS TO PRESS THE PIN UP SO THAT THE SPAsCE BETWEEN THE UPPER PIN AND
 THE LOWER PIN IS LEVEL WITH THE CYLINDER WALL. NOW, IF YOU PUSH A PIN UP, ITS
 TENDANCY IS TO FALL BACK DOWN, RIGHT ? THAT IS WHERE THE SCREWDRIVER COMES IN.
 INSERT THE SCREWDRIVER INTO THE SLOT AND TURN. THIS TENSION WILL KEEP THE
 "SOLVED" PINS FROM FALLING BACK DOWN. NOW, WORK FROM THE BACK OF THE LOCK TO
 THE FRONT, AND WHEN YOU'RE THROUGH.....
THERE WILL BE A CLICK, THE SCREWDRIVER WILL TURN FREELY, AND THE DOOR WILL
 OPEN. DON'T GET DISCOURAGE ON YOUR FIRST TRY! IT WILL PROBABLY TAKE YOU ABOUT
 20-30 MINUTES YOUR FIRST TIME. AFTER THAT YOU WILL QUICKLY IMPROVE WITH
 PRACTICE.
  THIS IS BY NO MEANS THE MOST EFFICIENT WAY OF ENTERING A HOUSE. IF YOU WOULD
 LIKE ANOTHER ITEM OR TWO DEVOTED TO THESE OTHER WAYS, LET THE SYSOP KNOW.

			   How to Pick Master Locks

    Have you ever tried to impress your friends by picking one of those Master
combination locks and failed? Well then read on. The Master lock company has
made this kind of lock with a protection scheme. If you pull the handle of it
hard, the knob won't turn. That was their biggest mistake...... Ok, now on to
it.

  1st number.  Get out any of the Master locks so you know what's going on.  1:
The handle part (the part that springs open when you get the combination), pull
on it, but not enough so that the knob won't move.  2:  While pulling on it turn
the knob to the left until it won't move any more.  Then add 5 to this number.
Congradulations, you now have the 1st number.

  2nd number.  (a lot tougher) Ok, spin the dial around a couple of times, then
go to the 1st number you got, then turn it to the right, bypassing the 1st
number once.  WHEN you have bypassed.  Start pulling the handle and turning it.
It will eventually fall into the groove and lock.  While in the groove pull on
it and turn the knob.  If it is loose go to the next groove; if it's stiff you
got the second number.

    3rd number: After getting the 2nd, spin the dial, then enter the 2 numbers,
then after the 2nd, go to the right and at all the numbers pull on it. The lock
will eventually open if you did it right. If can't do it the first time, be
patient, it takes time.

encourage a bit more sneakiness in the future.  It's a simple device that

fromhis locker, where he keeps it during Gym period, and be sure to put it

Building Mister Shim(TM)
------------------------

You'llneed a thin piece of metal about 2cm by 3cm.  (We're using metric here,
guys. So sue me.)  In the one I made I used a piece cut from an aluminum Coke
canand it worked fine.  Out of the 2cm end, cut it to look like the diagram
below(which I wish could be less confusing . . . just look at it carefully).

                      / - - - - 12mm - - - - \

                   (To SCALE? Are you KIDDING?)

Itlookstough, but really isn't . . . use a very sharp exacto knife to cut out
thetwo corners first, then a fine trangular metal file to smooth it and file
outthe small indentations.  It'll take about ten to fifteen minutes if you do
itcarefully, and it does NOT have to be EXACT . . . just get it as close as
youcan.  It helps to have one of those locks nearby to fine-tune the shim.
Simplyset the lock to its correct combiation and insert Mister Shim(TM) as
described below.  If it works as described, your shim is properly designed.

---------------------
UsingMister Shim(TM)
---------------------

Theguywho designed this particular type of lock knew that he'd have to
installsome sort of "back door" in it, for all those airheads who would change
thenumbers on their locks and then forget them, or in case Random Briefcase
Vandalsassaulted the luggage store, raping, pillaging, and changing
combinations as they went.  This is that back door.

Useissimple.  Slide the modified end of Mister Shim(TM) into the gap right
t to the dial on the lock.  (Try both sides, it varies from lock to lock.)
IfMister Shim(TM) goes in ALL THE WAY with a little jiggling, the number shown
onthe dial is correct.  If not, turn to the next number and try again.  On a
three-dial lock, it will take an average of only fifteen checks to find the
propercombination; on a two-lock case with a practiced operator, this adds up
toLESS THAN A MINUTE to open the case.

Youcannow access anything inside the case you like, or change the combination
ifyou wish.  (To change the combination, push the slide towards the hasp [see
firstdiagram] and hold it, then turn the dials to the desired new combo.  Your
victimwill have to go to someone with their own Mister Shim(TM) -- or destroy
thelock -- if they ever want to get into their briefcase again.)

UseMisterShim(TM) in good health.

  This article deals with Satellite hacking, CB info, and car phone
systems.

Satellite Control
-----------------
  Companies try to build satellites to last for as long a time as
possible.  Unfortunately, for the companies, things in space can
happen unexpectantly and suddently.  Take that satellite released by
the space shuttle.  It's orbit carried it way off t he correct
altitude.  The company's only hope was to fire a rocket on it in order
to bring it to the correct place.
  Now think...how does one on the ground fire a rocket in space?
Radio!  Gee, if the company could change the orbit, maybe we can too.
Sound interesting?  Of course we were not the first to think of this.
The satellite companies have worried about this for a long time.
There are stories about top secret codes, frequencies, and protocols
required to 'nudge' one of those babies.
  The only problem is that-there is little information about this out
there.  If you have any info, make a text file, and let others know of
your knowledge.  But let me tell you all I know about a simple
satellite whose telemetry is known well.
  OSCAR 6 was a satellite sent up in order to take in amateur signals
between 145.9 and 146.0 MHz, and re-transmit them between 29.45 and
29.55 MHz using a transponder.  Early in 1976, OSCAR 6 began to have
battery problems.  The telemetry allowed the ground command stations
to shut the satellite off at regular intervals to prolong the useful
life of the satellite.
  Now we know the satellite sent out telemetry reports at a certain
frequency (OSCAR 7 was 29.502 and 145.972 MHz).  And it sent them out
in the form of Morse code at about 20 wpm.  Information rate of spin,
power use, and temperature were sent out at 20 wpm.  This seems to
suggest that the control might have also used morse code.  Strangely
enough, there was never any information in the American Radio Relay
League magazine about just how they control the OSCAR satellites.
(Hams know what's safe and what's crazy also)
  Suggestions:  Don't overlook RTTY when trying to Satelhack
(Satellite hacking).  Also, chances are the owners will figure out
what you did, so 'downing', the ultimate for a satelhack, is pretty
difficult.

Citizen's Band
--------------
  CB is a very popular communications method.  Again, you need a
license from the FCC to operate legally.  But it's so hard to track
down a CB signal unless you have a massive amplifier or talk for hours
straight, there is little use in getting one.  Here is a list of
channel frequencies:

A Cheap Ghost-Interferance
--------------------------
  How can you start a real cheap ghost or interferance station?  Well,
the Radio Shack wireless FM microphone (the clip on one) is pretty
good for $19.95 (price may change).  It's range is said to be 100
yards, but actual tests show its range is about 100 ft.  outside, 40
ft.  inside.  However, in the instructions it says that increasing the
battery power will make it stronger, but this would not be in
compliance with the FCC (oh darn!).  One problem with this is that
with a stronger battery comes the risk of frying something inside.
Instead of trying to upgrade the silly thing, just make a new one.
Open it up and take a look at how it is made.  Now, get a cheap
microphone then feed it into an amplifier like that on your stereo.
Then take the outputs of the amplifier and feed it into the same kind
of circuit as the wireless microphone contains (use heavy-duty parts
so they won't fry.  The only parts are a varactor diode and three
silicon transistors).  You new transmitter can now block out stations
in a relatively sized neighborhood (great in cities).

Mobile Phones
-------------
  Radio phones have been around for a while.  The first mobile
telephone call was made September 11, 1946 between a Houston Post and
a St.  Louis Globe reporter.  An old mobile phone service in New York
city had 700 subscribers, but could only handle 12 conversations at a
time (because it had 12 channels).  There are some 160,000 mobile
telephones nationwide.
  The old service was doomed to fail.  Each major city had one or two
powerful transmitters to communicate with all car phones in a 30- to
50-mile radius.  To make a call from a car, you must find a vacant
channel, then call the operator and supply the number you want to
call.  The operator dials the number and connects you when the party
answers.  Only a few companies have dial-it-yourself service.  If
someone wants to call you, they must first find the mobile phone
operator in your area.  The operator finds a vacant channel and
transmits a series of tones that correspond to your phone and make it
ring-sort of as if it were a pager.  Once you answer, the operator
connects you and the caller.
  Clearly, the system was slow.  Worse, it could only serve a few
users at a time.  During rush hour, there was little hope of making a
call.  Few channels could be added because of the dearth of
frequencies for that kind of operation.  So now you can't get a mobile
phone of this type unless someone else gives one up.
  Enter the cellular mobile radio.  Instead of only 1 or 2
transmitters, an area is divided up into many small sections, called
'cells'.  Each has it's own low-powered transmitter just strong enough
to serve it's cell.  An average cell covers from one to eight square
miles and varies in shape from a circle to a squashed football.  Each
cell touches another, some overlap slightly.
  Adjacent cells use different channels-there are more than 600 in
each city to choose from-and a channel may be re-used several times in
the city if the cells are located far enough apart.  All of the cell's
transmitters hook into one network switching office, much like a
central office handles calls form land-based telephones.
  Each transmitter constantly sends out a special signal, and as you
drive from cell to cell, your telephone automaticly tunes in the
strongest cell.  When a call comes in for you, the network switching
office uses the channel to send a digital pulse signal that
corresponds to your ten-digit phone number (NPA+7 digits).
  When the phone hears it's number, it in effect says 'Here I am, in
this certain cell'.  That information is sent back to the network
switching office, which scans vacant frequencies, and relays the
information to your cell.  Finally, your unit tunes to that voice
channel, and the cell site rings you, and you talk.
  It sounds complicated-and it is.  But it works in seconds.  And it
can be expanded.  As more and more phones are added, cells can be
split into smaller cells with less power.  Cellular radio already
exists in Japan, Denmark, Norway, and Sweden.  In Denmark, service
began in 1981 and grew to 100,000 customers almost overnight.  Within
a few years all of Scandinavia will have compatable cellular systems.
Australia, Canada, and Mexico also plan systems.
  Why has the U.S.  lagged behind?  Yep, it's our old freinds, the
FCC.  They studied the system for 12 years before okaying the service
in 1982.  The U.S.  may be full celled by 1988.  Now is the time to
rent your backyard as a cellular station!
  The Bell companies will operate cellular service as the Cellular
Service Company.  Others such as GTE and MCI plan similar service.
Even the Washington Post is trying to get into it.  There are already
two systems, one in Washington/Baltimore, and one in Chicago.  Chicago
users pay about $50 rent and $25 monthly use fee for 120 minutes, and
25 cents/minute hereafter.  Average bills are $150/month.
  The main unit mounts in the trunk, and just the handset sits up
front.  The antennas are very small-about nine inches-and are hidden
inside the car.
  Now freaking old car phone systems shoudln't be that hard if you
really try.  The following are the freq's to remember:

  158.07-158.49 MHz (mobile)
  152.81-153.03 MHz (base stations)

  You CAN listen in on these freq's.  What I'm not sure about is
whether you can place a call-I would think so.  So Freq out!

Radio, and Airplane phones

     People jacked in so they could hustle. Put the trodes on and 
they were out there, all the data in the world stacked up like one 
big neon city, so you could cruise around and have a grip on it, 
visually anyway, because if you didn't, it was too complicated, 
trying to find your way to a particular piece of data you needed. 
Iconics, Gentry called that.

  Information is more basic
than matter and energy.

  Atoms, electrons, quarks
consist of bits --

  Binary units of
information

  Like those processed in
computer software

  And in the brain.

  The behavior of these bits,
and thus of the universe,

  Is governed by a single
programming rule.

             --Edward Fredkin



A UNIVERSE OF BITS AND BYTES

     Major historical accomplishments of the 20th century included 
the personalization and popularization of Quantum Physics, an 
acceptance of self-reference and circular causality in systems of 
mathematics and psychology, and the resulting development of 
cybernetic society.
     This philosophic achievement, which has dominated the culture 
of the 20th century, was based on a discovery by nuclear and 
quantum physicists around 1900, that visible-tangible realities 
are written in a digital assembly language we could accurately 
call "basic."
     It turns out that we inhabit a universe made up of a small 
number of elements-particles-bits which cluster together in 
geometrically-logical, temporary configurations.
     The solid Newtonian Universe rested upon such immutable 
General-Motors concepts as mass, force, momentum, and inertia, 
cast into a Manichaean drama involving equal reactions of good vs. 
evil, gravity vs. levity, entropy vs. evolution and coerced by 
such pious Bank-of-England notions as conservation of energy. This 
dependable, static, predictable, universe suddenly, in the minds 
of Planck/Heisenberg became digitized, transformed into shimmering 
quantum screens of electronic probabilities.
     Up here in 1988, we are learning to experience what Nils 
Bohr and Werner Heisenberg could only dream of. The universe, 
according to their cyberdelic equations, is best described as a 
digital information process with sub-programs and temporary ROM 
states, megas called galaxies, maxis called stars, minis called 
planets, micros called organisms, and nanos known as molecules, 
atoms, particles. All of these programs are perpetually in states 
of evolution, i.e., continually "running."
     It seems to follow that the great intellectual challenge of 
the 20th century was to make this universe "user friendly," to 
prepare individual human beings to decode, digitize, store, 
process & reflect the sub-programs which make up his/her own 
personal realities.


NOBODY KNEW WHAT THESE GUYS WERE TALKING ABOUT

     The chain of events that elevated us to this new genetic 
status, HOMO SAPIENS CYBERNETICUS, began around the turn of the 
century.
     Physicists, we recall, are traditionally assigned the task of 
sorting out the nature of reality. So it was the quantum 
philosophers who figured out that units of energy/matter were sub-
atomic bits of programmed information that zoom around in clouds 
of ever-changing, if/then, start/stop, off/on, 0/1, yin/yang 
probabilities in clusters of pixels, up-and-down recurring 
stairways of paradox.
     When they started out, no one understood what these guys were 
talking about. They expressed their unsettling theories in complex 
equations written on blackboards with chalk. Believe it or not, 
these great physicists thought and communicated with a neolithic 
took -- chalk-marks on the wall of the cave. The irony was this: 
Einstein and his brilliant colleagues could not experience or 
operate of communicate at a quantum-electronic level.
     Imagine if Max Planck pottering around in his mathematical 
chalk-board had access to a video-arcade game! He'd see right away 
that the blips on Centipede and the zaps of Space Invaders could 
represent the movement of the very particles that he tried to 
describe in the dusty symbols of his blackboard.


A WILD AND SCARY HALLUCINOGENIQUE

     Now let us reflect on the head-bursting adjustment required 
here. The relativistic universe described by Einstein and the 
nuclear physicists IS alien and terrifying. Quantum physics is 
quite literally a wild, confusing psyberdelic trip. It postulates 
an Alice-in-Wonderland, Sartrean universe in which everything is 
changing. As Heisenberg implied: nothing is certain except 
uncertainty. Matter is energy. Energy and matter are temporary 
states of info-bits, frozen at various forms of acceleration.
     This digital universe is not user-friendly when approached 
with a Newtonian mind. We are just now beginning to write a manual 
of operations for the brain and the universe, both of which, it 
turns out, are digital galaxies with amazing similarities.
     People living in the solid, mechanical world of 1901 simply 
could not understand or experience a quantum universe. Dear sweet 
old Einstein, who couldn't accept his own unsettling equations, 
was denounced as evil and immoral by Catholic bishops and sober 
theologians who sensed how unsettling and revolutionary these new 
ideas could be. Ethical relativity is still the mortal sin of 
religious fundamentalists.


THE CYBERPUNK AS MODERN ALCHEMIST
     
     The baby boom generation has grown up in an electronic world 
of TV and personal computing screens. The cyberpunks offer 
metaphors, rituals, life styles for dealing with the universe of 
information. More and more of us are becoming electro-shamans, 
modern alchemists.
     Alchemists of the Middle Ages described the construction of 
magical appliances for viewing future events, or speaking to 
friends distant or dead. Writings of Paracelsus describe a mirror 
of ELECTRUM MAGICUM with telegenic properties, and crystal scrying 
was in its heyday.
     Today, digital alchemists have at their command tools of a 
precision and power unimagined by their predecessors. Computer 
screens ARE magical mirrors, presenting alternate realities at 
varying degrees of abstraction on command (invocation). Aleister 
Crowley defined magick as "the art and science of causing change 
to occur in conformity with our will," and to this end the 
computer is the universal level of Archimedes.
     The parallels between the culture of the alchemists and that 
of cyberpunk computer adepts are inescapable. Both employ 
knowledge of an occult arcanum unknown to the population at large, 
with secret symbols and words of power. The "secret symbols" 
comprise the languages of computers and mathematics, and the 
"words of power" instruct computer operating systems to complete 
Herculean tasks. Knowing the precise code name of a digital 
program permits it to be conjured into existence, transcending the 
labor of muscular or mechanical search or manufacture.
     Rites of initiation or apprenticeship are common to both. 
"Psychic feats" of telepathy and action-at-a-distance are achieved 
by selection of the menu option.

     
CLASSICAL MAGICKAL CORRESPONDENCES

     Alchemists of the Middle Ages believed quite correctly that 
their cosmos was composed of four elements: earth, air, fire and 
water. Although today our periodic table sports more than 100 
chemical elements, the four universal elements still can be 
identified as the constituents of some processes in the external 
reality, and within the inner psychological world of humankind.
     Each of the four elements is an archetype and a metaphor, a 
convenient and appropriate name for a universally identified 
quality. The four are echoed in the organization of both the four 
suits and the four "court cards" of each suit of the Tarot, 
inherited from the Egyptians and its symbolism preserved in 
ordinary Western playing cards. The four also correspond to the 
four principal tools of the classical practitioner of ceremonial 
magick.
     The wand of the magician represents the phallic male creative 
force, fire. The cup stands for the female receptive force, and, 
obviously enough, is associated with water. the sword is the 
incisive intellect, moving and severing the air, the abstraction 
in which it moves. Finally, the pantacle (disk) is the grounding 
in earth (magnetic material), the stored algorithms. (We use 
Crowley's spelling of pentacle, which communicates the sense of 
"all and everything," advisedly.)

     These classical instruments of magick exist in modern cyber 
technology: The mouse or pen of the digitizing tablet is the wand, 
controlling the fire of the CRT display and harnessing the 
creative force of the programmer. It is used in all invocations 
and ritual as a tool of command. Spinning disk drives are the 
pantacles, inscribed with complex symbols, earthen tablets to 
receive the input of "air," the crackling dynamic ethereal 
intellectual electricity of the processor chip circuitry 
programming results. The RAM chips are, literally, the buffers 
("buffer pools"), the water, the passive element capable of only 
receiving impressions and re-transmitting, reflecting.
     Iconic visual programming languages are a Tarot, the 
pictorial summation of all possibilities, activated for the 
purpose of divination by juxtaposition and mutual influence. A 
periodic table of possibilities, the Western form of the Eastern
I Ching. Traditional word-oriented programming languages, FORTRAN, 
COBOL, and the rest, are a degenerate form of these universal 
systems, grimoires of profit-oriented corporations.
     Detailed database logs of the activity of operating systems 
from the Akashic records on a microscale. At a macroscopic level, 
this is the "world net" knowledge base, the "knoesphere," the 
world-wide online hypertext network of information soon to be 
realized by the storage capacity of CD ROM and the data 
transmission capability of optical fiber. William Gibson's 
cyberspace matrix.
     Banishing rituals debug programs, and friendly djinn are 
invoked for compiling, searching, and other mundane tasks. When 
the magic circle is broken (segmentation violation), the system 
collapses. Personal transmutation (the ecstasy of the "ultimate 
hack") is a veiled goal of both systems. The satori of harmonious 
human-computer communication resulting from the infinite regress 
into meta-levels of reflection of self is the reward for 
immaculate conceptualization and execution of ideas.
     The universality of 0 and 1 throughout magic and religion: 
yin and yang, yoni and lingam, cup and wand, are manifested today 
in digital signals, the two bits underlying the implementation of 
all digital programs in the world, in our brains and in our 
operating systems. Stretching it a bit, even the monad, symbol of 
change and the Tao, visually resembles a superimposed 0 and 1 when 
its curving central line is stretched through the action of 
centrifugal force from the ever-increasing speed of the monad's 
rotation.


CYBER RELIGION OF THE BABY BOOMERS

     By the year 2000, Aleister Crowley, William Gibson, and 
Edward Fredkin could well replace Benjamin Spock as a Baby Boom 
navigator. Why? Because, by then the concerns of the baby boom 
generation will be digital. (Or, to use the old paradigms, 
philosophic-spiritual.)
     During their childhood they were Mouseketeers. In their teens 
the Cybers went on an adolescent spiritual binge unequalled since 
the Children's Crusade. In their revolt against the factory 
culture they re-invented and updated their tribal-pagan roots and 
experimented with Hinduism, Haight-Ashbury Buddhism, American 
Indianism, Magic, Witchcraft, Ann Arbor Voo Doo, Esalen Yoga, 
Computerized I Ching Taoism, 3-D Reincarnation, Fluid Druidism. 
St. Stephen Jobs to the Ashram!
     Born-again Paganism! Pan-Dionysius on audio-visual cassettes. 
Mick Jagger had them sympathizing with the devil. The Beatles had 
them floating upstream on the Ganges. Jimi Hendrix taught them how 
to be a voodoo child. Is there one pre-Christian or third world 
metaphor for divinity that some rock group has not yet celebrated 
on an album cover?


ONTOLOGY RECAPITULATES THEOLOGY

     The Boomers in the evolving life-cycle seem to have 
recapitulated the theological history of our species. Just as 
monotheism emerged to unify pagan tribes into nations, so did the 
Boomers re-discover fundamentalist Judaism and Christianity in 
their young adulthood.
     Even far-away Islam attracted gourmet Blacks and ex-hippies 
such as Cat Stevens. Bob Dylan nicely exemplifies the consumer 
approach to religion. For 25 years Bob (ne Zimmerman) has 
continued to browse through the spiritual boutiques dabbing on a 
dash of Baptist "born-again," nibbling at Hassidism before 
returning to his ole-time faith of sardonic reformed humanism.
     We can laugh at this trendy shopping around for the custom-
tailored designer god, but behind the faddism we find a powerful 
clue.
     Notice how Dylan, for example, preserves his options and 
tries to avoid shoddy of off-the-rack soul-ware. No "plastic 
christs that glow in the dark" for Bob! The religion here is 
Evolutionism, based on the classic humanist, transcendental 
assumptions:

1.   God is not a tribal father nor a feudal lord nor an engineer-
     manager of the universe. There is no god (in the singular) 
     except you at the moment. There are as many gods (in the 
     plural) as can be imagined. Call them whatever you like.
     They are free agents like you and me.


2.   You can change and mutate and keep improving. The idea is to
     keep "trading up" to a "better" philosophy-theology.

3.   The aim of your life, following Buddha, Krishna, Gurdjieff,
     Werner Erhart, Shirley, is this:
     Take care of your self so you can take care of others. If 
     any.


WITH A LITTLE HELP FROM YOUR FRIENDS
     
     This generation, we recall, had been disillusioned by the 
religions, politics, & economics of their parents. Growing up with 
the threat of nuclear war, the assassination of beloved leaders, 
immune deficiencies, a collapsing industrial system, an impossible 
national debt, religious fundamentalisms (Christian-Jewish-
Islamic) that fanatically scream hatred and intolerance, and 
uncomprehending neglect of the ecology, they have developed a 
healthy skepticism about collective solutions.
     They can't retreat back home because Mom and Dad are 
divorced.
     No wonder they have created a psychology of individual 
navigation. Singularity. The basic idea is self-responsibility. 
You just can't depend on anyone else to solve your problems. You 
gotta do it all by yourself -- With a little help from your 
friends.


A DO-IT-YOURSELF RELIGION

     Since God #1 appears to be held hostage back there by the 
blood-thirsty Persian Ayatollah, by the telegenic Polish Pope and 
the Moral Majority, there's only one logical alternative. You 
"steer" your own course. You start your own religion. The Temple 
is your body. Your mind writes the theology. And the Holy Spirit 
emanates from that infinitely mysterious intersection between your 
brain and your DNA.
     The attainment of even the suburbs of Paradise involves good 
navigation and planning on your part. Hell is a series of 
redeemable errors. A detour caused by failure to check the trip-
maps. A losing streak. Many people are carefully conditioned from 
birth to live in hell. As children, they are largely ignored until 
something happens to cause them pain or injury. Then, mommy and 
daddy quickly lavish aid, attention, succor, positive 
reinforcement. When "all grown up," and in the world alone to make 
choices, what kind of choices are going to result from those many 
years of conditioning? It's no wonder so many people seem to live 
in hell, to live pained lives of mishaps and broken dreams. Of 
course, by realizing this we can begin to decondition ourselves 
towards healthy hedonism. Reward yourself for making choices that 
lead to pleasure, and build a cybernetic cycle of positive 
feedback. Only from the state of free selfhood can any truly 
compassionate signals be sent to others.


THE ADMINISTRATION OF A PERSONAL STATE

     The management and piloting of a Singularity leads to a very 
busy career. Since the Crowley-Gibson-Fredkin Individual has 
established herself as a religion, a country, a corporation, an 
information network, and a neurological universe, it is necessary 
to maintain personal equivalents for all the departments and 
operations of the bureaucracies that perform these duties.
     This apparently means forming private alliances, formulating 
personal political platforms, conducting your own domestic and 
foreign relations, establishing trade policies, defense and 
security programs, educational and recreational events. On the 
upside, one is free from dependence upon bureaucracies, an 
inestimable boon. (Free agents can, of course, make temporary 
deals with organizations and officials thereof.)
     And if countries have histories and myths, why shouldn't you?

THE PERSONAL MYTHOLOGY

     So you search and research your very own genetic memory 
banks, the Old Testaments of your DNA-RNA, including, if you like, 
past incarnations and Jungian archetypes. And funky pre-
incarnations in any future you can imagine!
     You write your very own Newest Testament, recalling that 
voluntary martyrdom is tacky and crucifixions, like nuclear war, 
can ruin your day.
     You can do anything the great religions, empires and racial 
groups have done in the name of their God #1. and you're certain 
to do it better because... well, look at their track records. 
There's no way your Personal State could produce the persecutions, 
massacres and bigotries of the Big Guys.
     Why? Because there's only one of you, and even with the help 
of your friends the amount of damage an individual can do is 
insignificant compared with the evil-potential of a collective.
     Besides, you're a child of the 60s. You're imprinted to want 
a peaceful, tolerant, funny world. You can choose your gods to be 
smart, funny, compassionate, cute and goofy.


IRREVERENCE IS A PASSWORD FOR THE 21ST CENTURY

     It has been suggested that the philosophic assignment of the 
Roaring 20th Century was to prepare the human species for the 
shifting realities of Quantum Physics and Singular Steering.
     Relativity means that everyone "sees" or reacts to things 
differently, depending upon location, velocity and attitude (angle 
of approach). 
     The relativistic insight is in essence irreverent or 
humorous, i.e., laughable, comical, delightful. With the law of 
gravity repealed, levity is the order of the day. We rise through 
our levity, instead of being held down by our gravity.
     The word "humor" comes from the Latin word for liquid or 
fluid, referring to such qualities as flowing, pliable, smooth, 
effortless, easily changed, non-frictional, transparent, shining, 
musical, graceful in motion and readily converted into cash.


THE LAST GENERATION IN FLESH?

     Through science and technology we will meet the aliens, and 
they will be us.
                       -- Norman Spinrad, "The Neuromantics"

     Information-beings of the future may well be fluid. Human 
society has now reached a turning point in the operation of the 
digital programs of evolution, a point at which the next 
evolutionary steps of the species become apparent to us, to surf 
as we will. Or, more correctly, as the evolutionary programs run 
and run, the next stages pop up in parallel, resulting in 
continuing explosions of unexpected diversity. Our concepts of 
what is known as "human" continually change. For example, we are 
no longer as dependent on physical fitness for survival. Our 
quantum appliances and improved mechanical devices can generally 
provide the requisite means or defenses. In the near future, the 
methods of information technology, molecular engineering, 
biotechnology, nanotechnology (atom stacking) and quantum-digital 
programming could make the human form a matter totally determined 
by individual whim, style and seasonal choice.
     Humans already come in some variety of races and sizes. In 
comparison to what "human" might mean within the next century, we 
humans are at present as indistinguishable from one another as are 
hydrogen molecules. Along with the irrational taboo about death, 
the sanctity of our body image seems to be one of the most 
persistent anachronisms of Industrial Age thought.
     We see evolutions of the human form in the future; one more 
biological-like: a bio/computer hybrid of any desired form -- and 
one not biological at all: an "electronic entity" in the digital 
info-universe.
     Human-AS-programs, and human-IN-programs.
     Of these two post-humanist views, human-as-programs is more 
easily conceived. Today, we have crude prosthetic implants, 
artificial limbs, valves, and entire organs. The continuing 
improvements in the old-style mechanical technology slowly 
increase the thoroughness of brain/external-world integration. A 
profound change can come with the developments of biotechnology, 
genetic engineering, and the slightly more remote success of 
nanotechnology.
     The electronic form of human-in-programs is more alien to our 
current conceptions of humanity. Through storage of one's belief 
systems as data structures online, driven by desired programs 
one's neuronal apparatus should operate in silicon basically as it 
dead on the meatware of the brain, though faster, more accurately, 
more self-mutably, and, if desired, immortally.
     Clever cyberpunks will of course not only store themselves 
electronically, but do so in the form of a "computer virus," 
capable of traversing computer networks and of self-replicating as 
a guard against accidental or malicious erasure by others, or 
other programs. (Imagine the somewhat droll scenario: "What's on 
this CD?" "Ah, that's just that boring adolescent Leary. Let's go 
ahead and reformat it.")
     One speculation is that such viral human forms might ALREADY 
inhabit our computer systems. Cleverly designed, they would be 
very difficult, if not theoretically impossible to detect. 
     Current programs do not permit matching the real-time 
operation speed and parallel complexity of conventional brains. 
But time scale of operation is subjective and irrelevant, except 
for the purposes of interface.
     Of course, there is no reason one needs to restrict one's 
manifestation to a particular form. One will basically (within 
ever-loosening physical constraints, though perhaps inescapable 
economic constraints) be able to assume any desired form.
     Authors of current science fiction of the cyberpunk or 
"neuromantic" school have approached this idea from many angles. 
Bruce Sterling's novel SCHISMATRIX recognizes the fact that human 
evolution moves in clades, radiating omnidirectionally, not moving 
in a line along a single path. His "Mechs" and "Shapers" 
correspond closely with our notions of electronic and biogenetic 
paths to evolutionary diversity.
     Given the ease of copying computer-stored information, it 
should be possible to exist simultaneously in many forms. Where 
the "I's" are in this situation is a matter for digital 
philosophers. Our belief is that consciousness would persist in 
each form, running independently, cloned at each branch point.
