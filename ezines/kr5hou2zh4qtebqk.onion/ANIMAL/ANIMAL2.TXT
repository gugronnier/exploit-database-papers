WHAT'S NEW

Still havn't recieved any mail yet.  Oh, well, I guess it may take a while for
it to get around.  This magazine will depend on your mail, submissions, etc.
Being only a one-man-team(there are no FUN people in my area ( that i have
found, anyway)) this means that i have to come up with new ideas, etc.  Some of
the shit in this issue is stolen from a mag. or book.  But i only use this for
the benefit of all human beings!  

    - Love everyone, dispite race, sex, sexual preference.

A FEW CELTIC MAGIC SPELLS

The following is just a few spells that I have encountered.  Remember, the
Celts combined the Physical, Mental, and Spiritual worlds.  Therfore, it would
not go against their belief's to use magic to gain material possesions.  This 
is a typical misconseption by a lot of people.  I hope to have a good-sized
spell book published by the next two issues.  It will probably also be
available at your good BBS's for download seperatly.

I will not go into rituals for these spells, the Magic Circle, or the such.  I
am assuming that most readers (those who stop to read this article) knows
about these or has adopted some form of spell casting rights.  I MAY do this
some time later, however.


TO GAIN MONEY

Fill a cauldron half full of water and drop a silver coin into it.[Today a
Quarter or Half-Dollar should sufice]  Position the cauldron so that light
from the Moon shines into the water.  Gently sweep your hands just above the
surface, sybolically gathering the Moon's silver.  

While doing this say:

    Lovely Lady of the Moon, bring to me your
    wealth right soon.  Fill my hands with silver
    and gold.  All you give, my purse can hold.

Repeat three times.  When finished, pour the water upon the Earth.  This is
best done at the Full Moon.


TO GAIN PROPHECIES

Fill the cauldron half-full and place it on a table where you can see
comfortably into it while seated.  Light two purple candles and a good
divinitory incense; a combination of mugwort and wormwood works well for
divination.  Arrange the candles do that their light does not shine into the
water and your eyes.  Focus your attention on the bottom of the cauldron, your
hands placed lightly on either side.  Breathe gently onto the water.

Say:

    Cauldron, reveal to me that which I seek.
    Great mother, open my inner eye that I
    may truly see.

Empty your mind as much as possible; remain relaxed while looking deep into
the cauldron waters.  The answers may come in images in the water, pictures in
your mind, and strong bursts of "knowing."  This spell is best done during the
waxing moon.

CANDLE MAGIC

This is a good generic spell for any candle spellwork.  It is very flexible in
it's use and can be used for most anything.

    Candle of power, candle of might,
    Create my desires here on this night.
    Power, stream from this candle's fire.
    Bring to me my heart's desire.
    My words have strength, the victory's
       won.
    So I say.  This spell is done.

It is best to leave the candle or candles in a safe place to burn out
entirely.


KLINGON

The following is an exerpt I stole from The Utne Reader, March/April 1994.
There were a few more sayings, but for lack of space I ommited a few.  The
Utne Reader is a very excellent magazine and can be bought on the rack for
$4.95 an issue (1994 prices), or subscribe 6 issues for $18.  The address for
Utne Reader is:

         UTNE READER Subscriber Service
         Box 1974
         Marion, OH  43305

Or can be reached via voice at 1-800-736-UTNE from 8:30 am - 8:30 pm EST M-F.

( I thought i would do them this favor since i did not obtain permission to
use the following exerpt. (Not to mention that they are a pretty cool mag.))

                      All about...

                             HACKING NETWORKS
                      brought to you by

                            LESTAT

After hacking my old high school computer's network for two months, I learned
that not all protection schemes are easy ( or sometimes even possible) to beat.
This paticulare system has 6 levels of security!!  Let me explain the setup.

In this high school, they had 3 rooms networked by 3 individial servers.  One
could "passthru" to other servers.  The 3 servers were:  Math Computer lab,
the Media Center, and the business lab.  Individual accoundts are provided for
the math lab - for anything from an algebra class to Computer Programming &
Pascal.  The Media Center used a generic account in which you typed the letter
assigned to the computer you were using.  Unfortunaly, the only program
available on these computers was Wordperfect 5.1 ( fuckin great program, heh?)
I never did figure out the workings of the business lab.

I started out by finding out that the majority of the students in the Calculus
class did not have passwords on their account.  The next thing i discovered,
was the lamest error a program could have.  By typing 'C' for "change 
password", and then hitting a Control-C, you were in to Dos.  The password 
program was run by a batch file, which as you well know when inturrupted will
cause a "Terminate Batch Job (Y/N)? " prompt.  By hitting 'Y', you were
brought to a dos prompt.  So what is the first thing i did?  I used about 2
megs of the hardrive space for my Hacker files, under someone else's account, 
of-course.  I then learned that my using PC-Shell ( PC TOOLS version 6.0 ),
that if the other accounts directories were hidden files, pc-shell would show
me this.  Unfortunatly, this was not the case.  However, there was a
sub-directory under "H:\students" entitled "Menus".  This provided me with a
list of all the user accounts on the Math server.  Almost 3/4 of the accounts
were dumbasses who did not feel a need to password-protect their accounts!

Another neat thing to do with this, was to change the PROMPT to some
intersting message.  If that person would log on to that computer, and break
into dos, they would see my Interesing messages.  I basically had to teach dos
to a bunch of computer-wanna be's, who probably play Solitare on their 486's,
which as you know Windows turned them into XT's.  

Any way, in case you were wondering, this is about as far as i got.  I
couldn't figure out the password sheme, but I used a total of 9 megs of the 
hardrive space in both mine and other's directories.  All this time I was 
using the information to expand my learning about computers and such, while
the other dumbshits felt so cool by breaking into DOS to play Leisure Suit
Larry ( what a cool game, you get to play a loser who can't get any!!).  For 
your further network hacking, this system was none only than IBM's own net.  
Count on them to make stupid mistakes!!

(You may also want to try using the account "supervisor".  It worked in this
case.  Instead of giving you a menu, it drops you straight into DOS.  You
can look in any directory, and you have modification rights(you can do what ever
you want to) to any and all directories)


Happy networking!!
